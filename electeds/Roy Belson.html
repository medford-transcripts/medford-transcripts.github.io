    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3162.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Belson, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, a longtime member of the Jewish community, and a former employee of the Medford Public Schools for 50 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3171.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm here to speak tonight on the proposed ordinance that you did lay on the table, but I believe I have some words to say that I would like to have heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3180.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3184.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The role of city government is to focus on the welfare and betterment of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3190.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As individuals, you always have the right to advocate for issues in the international arena.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3196.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a local governmental body representing a diverse community, you need to promote harmony, not create friction and fragmentation over an issue that is not your mandate and well beyond your capacity to significantly influence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3211.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Words carry meaning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3214.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The old saw that sticks and stones may break bones, but words will never harm me is very misleading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3221.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes words are sharper than a sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3225.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All you have to do is study social media or be bombarded with campaigns of disinformation to realize that words can lead to severe negative outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3236.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To paraphrase, the road to disaster is often paved with good intentions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3243.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do not let your zeal to advance your ideals blind you to adverse impacts your actions can and will create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3251.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issues in the Middle East are not just contemporary, but are hundreds of years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3257.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The causes and circumstances are complex, and the resolution has been defying even the most honorable peace brokers amidst the actions of multiple terrorist groups and partisan fanatics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3270.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't have to agree with all of Israeli policies and practices to recognize the Israelis' right to exist, but to recognize the urgent need to eliminate any possibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3281.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of anti-Semitism in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3284.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Recently, think about the young couple in Washington, Yaron and Sarah, who were gunned down leaving the Israeli embassy by a man screaming, free Palestine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3295.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And 11 days later, think about what happened in Boulder, Colorado, when a man yelling, free Palestine, threw a Molotov cocktail at peaceful marchers calling for the release of hostages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3307.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Think about Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who barely escaped with his family a fire in his home started by another man calling to free Palestine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3317.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I could go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3319.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't think for a moment it couldn't happen here in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3323.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are as vulnerable as any other Jewish American community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3328.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The proposed ordinances are performative at best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3333.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Passage will not alter the international reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3336.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any study of BDS has not proven effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3340.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts law and practice makes implementation of such a proposal impractical and not in the best financial interests of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3353.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You already passed a resolution in February of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3357.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Will you accept accountability if anti-Semitic violence happens in our community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3364.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't delude the Palestinian supporters in our community that such an ordinance can even be enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3371.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't subject the Jewish citizens in our community to a greater threat of hate and violence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3376.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can happen here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3379.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead, demonstrate real leadership by rejecting performative votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3385.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can preserve and advance your values and concerns much better by promoting community dialogue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3392.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by bringing citizens together, by promoting understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3397.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Council business has many challenges and you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3400.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Focus on what you can do to better unify the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=3405.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6877.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: William Ellison, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6880.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6881.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bring people together, bring people together in small groups, bring people together to talk to each other and talk with each other and understand the history of the Middle East.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6890.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Understand the tensions, understand all the peace treaties that were broken and not gone forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6895.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can basically have a really good understanding of how to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6900.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A performative ordinance<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6902.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's going to get knocked down by legal issues, financial issues, and other things like that, doesn't really bring people together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6910.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Try to find ways so people can sit together and talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6913.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can tell you that last year or the year before, we had a book club at the temple, and we invited the imam from the cultural center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6920.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great discussion, great discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6924.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're as concerned about Muslims as we are about Jews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6927.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We understand that any number of people can be discriminated against.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6931.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the way to bring things together, the way to build community, is not to put something out there that fragments, but to put in place processes that enable us to talk with each other, share viewpoints, and come to new understandings that allow us to move forward as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6947.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your understanding, and I hope that you'll take that advice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=6951.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=282.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=283.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=287.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=296.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=307.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=326.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=333.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=342.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=346.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=349.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=351.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=354.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=361.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=375.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=379.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=385.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=389.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=407.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=417.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=421.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=426.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=428.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=439.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pertinent questions are these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=441.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it true that we're in a deficit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=444.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=448.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives available to meet our needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=453.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is this a one-time request or will there be another one, a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=458.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=461.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=464.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=469.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=475.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=480.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=487.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=490.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=501.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=508.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=511.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=519.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=529.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=532.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=539.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=547.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=555.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school administration, by law, is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=567.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=570.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=577.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=582.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=585.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=594.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=603.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=607.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=613.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=616.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, did they fail to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=628.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=630.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=636.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a need for an override, because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=650.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=653.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=657.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office, and the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=666.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=670.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=672.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=675.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=679.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=681.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=684.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=691.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=699.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=716.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=719.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=730.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=736.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=740.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=743.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=744.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=749.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=750.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=756.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=762.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=771.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=779.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=781.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=783.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=785.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=791.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're going to reassess it and the taxes are going to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=797.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably going to pay a little bit more for water and sewer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=801.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=808.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=823.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=826.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=829.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=832.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=838.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=841.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=847.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=851.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=855.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=859.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=861.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=863.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=871.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=876.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=880.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=883.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=888.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=895.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in a planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=909.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=912.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=921.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=924.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=931.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=936.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=937.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=941.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=953.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=959.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=960.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=974.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=979.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=983.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=985.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=994.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1004.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1009.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1015.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1018.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1020.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1022.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1031.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1037.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them, and we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1046.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want, and no school system is able to do that, and no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1053.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1057.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1063.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1065.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1067.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1068.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1071.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1089.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996, and I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1095.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1105.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville 23958, we just built a building so you can see where,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1117.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1118.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you want to chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1121.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1128.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1130.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1141.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1153.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1155.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1159.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1161.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1169.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1172.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1173.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1178.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1180.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, you know, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1188.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1189.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1194.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're going to make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1205.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1207.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1208.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1209.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1210.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1211.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, the charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1212.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1214.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1234.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1243.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1247.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1249.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1255.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1260.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because our benefits are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1262.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're very good, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1264.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1268.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1271.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1277.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1280.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1287.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1291.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1294.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1299.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1308.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1311.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1316.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1317.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1319.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1327.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1330.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1333.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1342.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1344.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1346.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are voting against it, need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1351.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1359.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1362.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1366.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting or are going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1372.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, so the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1377.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1381.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1384.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election for the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1396.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1402.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1405.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1406.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1411.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1419.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1437.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1442.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1450.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1455.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1458.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1463.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1473.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1479.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1483.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1487.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1488.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1499.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1501.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1505.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1506.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1509.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1521.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1526.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1528.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1533.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1539.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1548.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1552.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1557.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1559.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1566.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1580.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1584.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1586.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1588.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1590.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1593.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1596.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1600.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1604.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1607.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1609.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1613.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1617.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1621.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1626.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1629.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GgbS8a88bZQ&t=1631.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=139.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nice to see everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=140.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=144.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=153.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=164.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=183.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=190.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=199.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=203.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=206.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know how hard they work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=208.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know the challenges that they face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=211.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=218.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=232.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budget development must be resourceful and creative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=236.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=242.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=246.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=264.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=274.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=278.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=283.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a property tax levy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=285.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=296.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pertinent questions are these is it true that it's we're in a deficit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=301.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How does Medford compare with other communities around us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=305.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are there good alternatives?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=307.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: available to meet our needs Is this a one-time request or will there be another one a larger request in the near future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=315.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you know the answer to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=318.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=321.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=326.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=332.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's take a look and let's consider the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=337.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=344.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=347.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=358.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=365.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So was this necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=368.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=376.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=386.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost at this point in time, $35 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=389.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if that was the case, was it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=396.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=404.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=412.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school administration by law is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=424.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's their legal request to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=427.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=434.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=439.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=442.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=451.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=460.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why, given the often repeated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=464.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: mantra of the mayor, transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=470.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Interesting word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=473.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the city's financial director, that they failed to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=485.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the answer's simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=487.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=493.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a need for an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=496.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=507.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=510.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=514.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was working with the superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=517.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=523.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=527.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=529.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 150 people got laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=532.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was difficult, very difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=536.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=538.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=541.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=548.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=558.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=573.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why create a crisis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=576.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=587.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=593.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you have them, why won't you use them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=597.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's talk about the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=600.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford tax rate is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=601.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=606.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=607.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=613.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=619.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=628.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=636.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about the impact of re-evaluation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=638.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what's going on right now, they're checking your houses out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=642.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=648.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when they reassess it, they're gonna reassess it and the taxes are gonna go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=654.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on top of that, you're probably gonna pay a little bit more for water and sewer,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=658.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=665.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=680.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what about renters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=683.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these people will never have a chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=686.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just won't be able to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=689.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=695.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that affects people too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=698.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=704.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=708.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that anymore in the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=712.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=716.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people can get around it for various reasons,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=719.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=720.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=728.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 14% are 70 or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=733.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=737.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have another alternative to go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=740.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=745.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a hit like this is really significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=752.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in the planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=766.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll make three override requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=769.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=778.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given the cost of a rebuild,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=781.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=788.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=793.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will only cover certain costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=794.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everything is eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=798.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=810.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=816.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an expensive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=817.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=831.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=836.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't tell anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=840.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't get that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=842.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment, over and above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=856.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=861.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if the override passes in November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=866.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=872.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not gonna wait a year to build it up, you're gonna see it in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=877.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only a few months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=879.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=888.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=894.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=901.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have plenty of needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=903.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one gets everything they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=906.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And no school system is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=908.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And no community is able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=910.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=914.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=920.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state average per pupil<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is $19,714.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=922.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is currently spending $21,372.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=924.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Arlington is spending $18,615.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=925.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is spending $17,428.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=927.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is spending $15,540.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=928.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Peabody is spending $16,996.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=929.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I can go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=952.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=964.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there are places, Somerville, 23,958, we just built a building so you can see where that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=975.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if you wanna chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=981.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=985.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Burlington is $25,297.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=987.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=996.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1008.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of money out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1010.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1012.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1016.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1018.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1026.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So then the question comes about teacher salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where's Charlene?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1029.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charlene, the room boy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1031.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, Charlene, don't take offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1035.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1037.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, obviously it's gone up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1045.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average salary is $88,179.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1046.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1047.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're gonna make $111,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1062.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1064.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the average salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1065.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Melrose is $76,369.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly is $84,765.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1066.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Malden is $83,366.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1067.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marblehead is $84,365.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1068.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mystic Valley, their charter school, is at $73,823.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1069.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1071.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1091.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1100.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1104.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They leave because they don't have good benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1106.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1112.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us, because our benefits are good,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1120.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: very good, by the way, and our salary is competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1125.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1129.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1134.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But people will stay with us for stability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1137.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1144.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1148.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1151.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1156.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1165.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much are we leaving on the table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1168.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1173.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1174.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1176.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1184.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't underestimate revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1187.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's strive for affordability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1190.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1199.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Be specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1201.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The people who are voting for this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1203.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are voting against it need to know where every dollar is going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1208.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1216.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: General categories don't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1219.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The override vote is less than two months away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1223.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And residents, citizens, are already voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1227.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're going to start voting very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1229.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So besides the general information on the web, of the city's web,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1234.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1238.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably not a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1241.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of you will vote by mail at the general election, or the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1253.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out, because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1259.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1262.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of you probably got this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1263.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1268.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1276.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1294.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1299.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1307.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1312.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're gonna be surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1315.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many will vote by mail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1320.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1330.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1336.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1340.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The city council needs more information on the city's finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1344.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1345.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1356.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1358.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1362.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1363.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people will vote without really knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1366.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1378.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1383.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's gonna be expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1385.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1390.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1396.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1405.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1409.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When legitimate resources are available without an override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1414.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not leverage the override.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1416.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1423.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1437.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, you haven't got all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1441.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you don't know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1443.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The big ticket item coming down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1445.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You haven't got any idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1447.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At least you don't, many of you don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1450.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1453.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1457.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1461.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our school system will be played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1464.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't leverage the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1466.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department, you don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1474.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got the resources available, then do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1478.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1483.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1486.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The case hasn't been made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdrmk9tzgf8&t=1488.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=860.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: language instruction of the elementary grades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=862.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a tremendous program, and they've involved the Italian Consulate, and as you know, there's been many more activities besides just the language instruction that they brought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=871.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I'm disappointed in tonight, Chikandra, is the fact that I thought you were gonna give me a Ferrari tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=877.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought that was part of the deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=879.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, having not received that, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=882.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sorry, but you know they did bring...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=900.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now watch what happens with this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=902.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, come on up and get it before I spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1058.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1060.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1061.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1062.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1063.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1064.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Have you heard of some of the children?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1183.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me go over them real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1186.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1190.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pursuant to our budget hearings that we had last Thursday, we reviewed some of the items that you brought up and tried to make some adjustments based on available funding that occurred during the few days that came after that meeting, and also based on what we perceived to be errors in the budget, at least in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1214.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in front of you, you have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1217.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a budget document follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1218.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to go through it for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1223.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two resignations from the vocational school, faculty yielded $17,116 in savings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1230.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One was in the auto shop and the other was part of the engineering program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1234.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Salaries would allow some gapping between what they would have made if they had stayed and what we will replace them at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1242.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that gives us back $17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1246.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was a few resignations from the special ed faculty, and that will yield another $3,339.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1252.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these total areas, the two of them, give us $20,455 in available funding to be reapplied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1263.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one area that you actually voted the other evening was the banned travel account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1271.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that applause or is that just a... The band travel account got $3,000 that you actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1279.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, just so we understand, we have not changed the lines in your budget because until we make all the agreements tonight, we're not going to change things internally because once we change one page, we have to change five or six pages at least, minimum, because they all play off each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1295.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we're putting $3,000 into the band account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1299.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The elementary textbook account is going to be increased by $1,500 per school for a total of $6,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1305.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we put it in textbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1307.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can be used for educational materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1308.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can be used for supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1310.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever the principal feels is important, but that gives them a little bit more back based on some of the discussion that was had the other evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1321.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The crew athletic program is expanding rapidly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1324.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had several meetings outside of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1326.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor has hosted several meetings, and there's several things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1330.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have two seasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1331.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order to supply the coaches, we are $8,400 short, so we added that to the athletic budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1338.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would cover that situation going forward this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1343.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there were two corrections to the principalships of the Andrews and the McGlynn Elementary that needed to be brought up to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1351.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were using older numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1354.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That required $1,463 to go to the Andrews and $1,692 to the McGlynn Elementary Principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1363.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the total additions of recaptured funds evens out at $20,455.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1369.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The above adjustments and corrections will be made tonight if they're approved by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1374.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we progress toward the school budget, the end of the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1381.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be multiple changes based on personnel matters and non-salary costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1387.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there will be people that come and go, just like there are all year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1391.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will bring you up to date periodically in order to free up some funds, either to fill an account that might need a boost because of cost, or maybe to add something back that we couldn't add back in the first cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1407.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as I said, we're not changing budget lines because it would affect too many page changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1412.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make the line adjustments once all decisions are made regarding the budget and provide copies to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1418.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, the second page of what you've been handed has a report on union settlements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1424.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I reported the other evening, the only union settlement at this point in time is a union settlement with the administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1433.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to recommend later on this evening to look at the unit building principles and other units are still being negotiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1442.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some discussion tonight about the teacher's contract and we're meeting with the teachers tomorrow as well as the paraprofessionals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1448.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you information in that executive session as part of negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1454.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition, today we met extensively with Safe Havens,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1459.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the group that is doing the comprehensive study of our security procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1464.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1467.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another visit will be coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1469.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've already had two visits now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1473.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when that is ready, we will come back with them with some recommendations regarding security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1479.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have kept the security line in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1484.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean that that will be the way we expend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1488.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be tied to the recommendations of Safe Havens and the wishes of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1493.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's see what that report tells us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1496.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a number of things we talked about today that are non-cost items that we think could be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1503.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some repositioning things that could also be helpful, no-cost items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1507.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are some things that are low-cost items that they think would be very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1513.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's let that report come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1514.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, we have the line item in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1518.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to spend against it until that report comes out, but we'll prepare ourselves to go in several directions and provide information to the committee so that we're ready to move once we see that report and once we reach some agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1532.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is that piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1536.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, one other item that came up the other evening that I think deserves some sort of mention tonight, and that's the Buildings and Grounds budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1546.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that the projects that will be most consistent with what the community is asking for and what we've seen must come from capital funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1556.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget will not meet those needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1561.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we have taken from that budget reflects our savings in telephone, reflects our savings in various forms of energy, reflects our savings in other areas, in cleaning, that we believe we can absorb at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1579.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that allows the city<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1582.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to consider our capital requests, which I've given you some suggestions, but certainly others may be in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1589.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as a committee and the mayor, you can sit and decide what you think is most appropriate as opposed to anything that I might think is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1599.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And certainly Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent will weigh in as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1603.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should tell you this evening that she would be here except the fact that her son Elijah had his wisdom teeth pulled and she's home giving him some comfort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1612.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I spoke to her and I've gone over the materials and I know that she's in support of what I'm giving him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1618.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I feel comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1620.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what we've done so far since Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1623.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I would hope that the committee would support the budget as we've presented it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1627.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of work has been done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1629.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Staff has worked very hard to make things fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1632.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budgets have contingencies in them, as we've talked about the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1635.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You never know when something new is going to pop up, and you never know when we're going to save something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1639.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the process of managing a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1642.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we do every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2256.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me try and answer some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2258.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, there's only one reduction in the vocational faculty, and that's for a program that only had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2264.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you can't sustain a program with one student, and the demand statewide has gone down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2270.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to be realistic when a program is not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2273.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2275.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't fund it just simply because we've always had it or had it for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2280.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Programs will come and go a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2281.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: New programs will emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2283.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be that coming forward a year from now, there might be a plumbing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2287.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There might be some other program that is more likely to attract students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2292.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You talked about landscaping the other night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2293.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be something that's more attractive than the program that has one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2298.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the only reduction is the one teacher from the program that had one student in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2304.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the dollars and cents go, I don't want to get into individuals right now, but I know that some of them moved closer to home and also got more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2313.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2314.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's usually an attraction for people in the trades when they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2320.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just simply need to pay attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2322.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money we have, we're not moving any money away from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2324.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just simply saying that at this point in time, in order to cover the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2328.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: variances or the different adjustments that you want, this is a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2333.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if a person costs more money, we'd go to undistributed to take that money from that account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2337.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2338.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's ways to make that up, but we have to begin someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2343.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You take it where it exists initially, and then you move to cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2391.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so, so recruitment is underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2394.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we're certainly going to recruit people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2395.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to make every effort to bring people in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2398.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can I absolutely give you a, you know, a guarantee that we'll have the person we want by September?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2403.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2404.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's highly likely we'll be aggressive out there to get people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2407.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are people out there who want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2410.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if a person has got good skills and ability, it may require getting a waiver from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in order to help them bridge the gap between their trade and also their teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2422.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we certainly have no intention of diminishing the faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2427.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2428.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: English teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2429.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Social studies teachers go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2430.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2432.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll be at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2434.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2691.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, the mayor has got many projects in front of her, you know, and I'll let her answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2695.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I mean, obviously the schools were important, and I think she recognizes that has been generous over a period of time as as a predecessor has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2704.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just think we need to put a list together and see where we can go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2708.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think we, you know, need to give ourselves a multi year plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2712.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't promise everybody everything all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2714.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if people see progress, I think they'll be encouraged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2717.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we can work from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2837.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to suggest to you, you might be more productive to refer it to the legislature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2843.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's clearly not a legal issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2846.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clearly a way that the legislature funds these things statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2852.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons why they place people in different homes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2855.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there may be housing available in some communities, sometimes not in others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2860.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But maybe there could be an option that the legislature could put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2863.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think that the solicitor can tell you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2866.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the legislature must do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2868.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the solicitor can tell you that, you know, the possibility exists if they choose to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2881.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They technically are, but it's always subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2883.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The famous last words of subject to appropriation, which means if they don't appropriate the money, they don't have to reimburse us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3494.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been around a long time, as most of you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3497.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people think too long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3498.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But nevertheless, I've seen a lot of budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3502.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you get hung up on any one item,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3506.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not helping because the budget is much bigger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3509.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to be able to look at the budget in its totality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3513.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can express your displeasure or your concern about an item or a particular thing, but you don't want to not vote for the things that you do care about, supplies for the kids, teachers, materials, all the kinds of things, services that kids need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3530.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, if you have an objection to a particular item, express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3536.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But don't not vote for the whole budget, because the budget probably has many things in it that you do want to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3542.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really something to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3544.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can come out and say what you don't like, but you certainly want to support all the resources, $60 million worth of resources going to young people and families in this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3558.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way you've got to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3559.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's the way I have to look at it every year, because there are many things that I would like to put in the budget that I can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3565.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, if I had, you know, an unlimited checkbook, you'd be a lot more things in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3570.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one ever does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3572.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, today, you should know that the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled against the Fair Share Amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3578.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the million dollars tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3580.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's 1.9 to 2 billion dollars worth of lost revenue that the Commonwealth will not... And the legislature is going to have to struggle, and the governor is going to have to struggle with how they are going to fund things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3594.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The discussion of the foundation budget is rife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3597.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the offsets are rife, circuit breaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3599.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3601.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where are the resources going to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3603.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no one, whether it's the state level or our level, gets to fund everything they believe should be in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3612.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would just suggest that if there's a particular item that you feel needs more attention going forward, you express it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3622.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But don't withhold your support for a whole budget, because you're basically saying the other things aren't worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3628.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course they're worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3630.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of things are worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4418.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna share this with our assistant superintendent for finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4422.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4424.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She did all the work in getting it together and out to, with Schaub and working together to get the stuff in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4431.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we got back exactly what we expected to get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4437.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because that's what we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4439.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think what's really significant beyond the work in here is the kinds of things that Lesley College is willing to do with us, and this is only the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4450.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some really productive discussions, they'll continue, and you know, Maurice has been involved and will continue to get more people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=110.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=112.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=113.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=120.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=122.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=125.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=141.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=143.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=149.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=152.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=153.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=154.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=158.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably, what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=160.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=165.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=169.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1890.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there is none?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1891.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have a full minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1895.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1934.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5176.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5188.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5192.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5194.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5209.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5212.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5229.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tie her up every day so I mean so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5235.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5236.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll give me a feedback as well and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6620.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6623.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6627.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6629.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6632.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6634.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6637.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution, and that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6641.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6647.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6648.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6652.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6655.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6664.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6668.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6673.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6675.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6677.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6682.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6685.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6687.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6695.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6698.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6701.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of tradeoffs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6702.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6708.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6709.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6753.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6761.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6917.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6921.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6933.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6937.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6940.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6941.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6942.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6944.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6953.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6961.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6967.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6971.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6974.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7120.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7123.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7125.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a sense of that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7624.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7627.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of the plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7641.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7644.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7647.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7664.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7669.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7675.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7680.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7695.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7702.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7706.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7708.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week posting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7711.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7722.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7731.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7740.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7751.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In other words, saying they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7757.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7758.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7764.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7769.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7779.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7784.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7791.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7801.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7804.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7812.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7821.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7843.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7844.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7845.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7849.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7865.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7871.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7885.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7888.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, that like all these universities would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7931.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work, based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7940.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7945.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7958.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7961.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7963.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7969.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7978.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't see us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7979.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8002.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8013.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8016.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8018.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because essentially they can work on it and we can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8026.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8028.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8029.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8049.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8059.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8061.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8062.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8067.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8072.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8075.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8086.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8087.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8090.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go over very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8092.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8097.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8111.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, that's interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8117.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8118.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8152.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8154.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8155.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8161.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8165.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards, okay, which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8172.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8174.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8222.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8223.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8225.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8233.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8237.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8242.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9073.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9075.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9080.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9085.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9091.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9095.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9103.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9105.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9107.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9115.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9118.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people, perhaps, to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9128.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9132.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9137.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9142.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9143.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9145.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9150.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9154.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During the course of the year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9156.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other, and because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9165.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9168.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9170.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9171.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9177.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one, because they go with their friends, because that's one of the biggest reasons why<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9186.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9189.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9193.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9198.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9208.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9212.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send them might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9223.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9227.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9229.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9231.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9234.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9236.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9238.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9242.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9250.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're gonna make a decision because we gotta get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9252.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9294.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9297.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9304.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9306.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9311.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9423.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9426.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9429.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9431.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9439.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9444.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that this won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9450.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9453.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9464.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9468.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9545.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9547.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9548.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9550.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9552.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9554.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9556.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9560.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9565.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9571.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9577.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10224.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10234.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10237.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10241.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10244.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10256.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10265.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10273.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10275.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10279.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10286.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10331.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10335.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins, and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10338.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10340.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not going to change the balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10341.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10342.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10344.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10636.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10638.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10642.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10649.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10652.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10656.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10660.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11574.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11589.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11591.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11593.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11595.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11596.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11597.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11602.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11606.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for effects to the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11613.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11615.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11622.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11623.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11735.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can, under community participation, provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11742.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11746.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11752.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=110.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are you looking at Minuteman or Milestones?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=112.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=113.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Minuteman is a vocational technical Chapter 74 program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=120.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the payments are grouped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=122.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think the instance on the 63, is that what you're asking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=125.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, the 63 and the 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=141.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not really, not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=143.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they have a lot of kids in horticulture, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=149.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, they're likely to have two or three kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=152.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=153.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's really going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=154.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It went down from 50 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=158.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably what, three or four?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=159.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seven right now, maybe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=163.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Six or seven at minimum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=165.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nine at minimum, that's including Essex, no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=169.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1885.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We haven't approved him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1889.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the report you put in the wrong place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1892.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1893.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only question is, is he?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1897.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1898.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1899.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only question was they passed on a 7-0 for just a vote, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1934.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our assistant superintendent to give this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5176.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as much as we're going to miss Rita, and we are going to miss Rita and her wonderful work, this week we begin the formal interviews of foreign language department directors starting Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5188.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be a team from the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5192.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Osborne is also participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5195.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We hope to have something in front of the committee very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5209.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5212.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'll get to see the people that the department screens out, and then she can make some decisions along with everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5219.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give us feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5228.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schedule, I can't tie her up every day, so when we get it down to a few people that people are comfortable with, we'll have her involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5235.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then she'll give me her feedback as well, and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6620.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6623.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some parents like the youngsters to stay with who they've grown up with or who they've gone with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6627.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other parents want them back in their neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6629.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have siblings back in their neighborhood, and they want them back with the siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6632.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be daycare issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6634.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issues and the variables are tremendous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6637.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no perfect solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6639.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6641.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you talk to policymakers in town, what they tell you is focus on the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6647.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's best for the child?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6648.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want the child moving around any more than you have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6652.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want a lot of dislocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6655.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply concentrate everything in one place all the time, especially elementary, because you will overload that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6664.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In middle school, it becomes a little bit more believable because kids are a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6668.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's only two of them, whereas we've got four elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6673.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the state makes rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6675.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state makes all kinds of policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6677.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got a new pro look, which we'll have to see how that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6682.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes they don't take into account space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6685.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't take into account adding additional staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6687.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what Paul was telling you is that to move things over to the Andrews, he needs four additional people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6695.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to tell you, that's over a quarter of a million dollars plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6698.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just for that alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6701.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's a lot of trade-offs here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6702.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, tonight as you're talking about different programs, you're talking about you want to add this, you want to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6708.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6709.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're wiped out if you're going to try and do some of this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6754.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if- Originally, when the numbers were lower, the thought was always go back to your school, your neighborhood, but things have changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6917.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be eight total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6921.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that, listening to the whole discussion this evening, dealing with extra help and all the other things, we've got to begin to actively and more actively explore the use of software and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6933.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as long as something is labor intensive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6937.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You require more and more staff, more and more benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6940.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, you can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6941.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, you can't schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6942.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, you don't have enough space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6944.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to find ways to use the technology more effectively and find those pieces that will attract youngsters, whether it's math or it's language arts or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6953.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to work with some people to see if there's technology assists we can use that also can go home with the youngsters to build language skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6961.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we are just not going to have enough personnel, space,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6967.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: materials to do everything the state says we're supposed to do on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6971.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not just Medford, that's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6974.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7120.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Paul, what's the status of Title III right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7123.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, everything's up in the air federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7624.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So last Thursday we had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7627.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the conclusion of the committee of the whole, you voted 7-0 to approve the concept of your plan, but you wanted to understand procurement better and how we were able to do it under the rules so that we could move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7641.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight I've handed you a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7644.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: sheet, two sides, which goes over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7647.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've had substantial discussion, Christine, myself, Mark Rumley, Howard Greenspan, Howard's here, going over these various things and also phone calls into the AG and the IG and all these things as to what we could or couldn't do, and also with Lesley College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7664.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we have to move forward if we're going to get this thing done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7669.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in order to do it, we have to deal with it a little bit differently than we originally intended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7675.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to go over this a little bit as a partnership procurement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7679.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to develop an RFP, which is a request for proposals, for the partnership that would include rental, renovation, and professional services between the Medford Public Schools and an area university, an area university, not necessarily any one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7695.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A request for proposals allows us to seek proposals from qualified vendors and to select the most appropriate respondents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7702.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on established criteria first and not price alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7706.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a price issue initially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7708.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This RFP cycle is a two-week hosting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7711.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That means once we generate the RFP, hopefully sometime this week with help, we would go out two weeks and put it out there and see who responds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7722.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The RFP would require the successful respondent to meet and agree to all the terms of the RFP specifications, everything we would put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7731.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Funding for the project would be incorporated into the RFP, we would say what we're looking for, for negotiation between the successful respondent and the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7740.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The successful respondent would then be allowed to carry out the construction and renovation of the high school gymnasium facility with provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7751.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say they would do it as opposed to we would do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7757.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Appropriate insurance coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7758.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would be in place to cover any unforeseen issues, any liabilities that would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7764.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan would allow for a successful respondent to move quickly towards implementation this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7769.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they would be able to do things in the private sector, and we would insist on prevailing wage and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7779.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would be able to move a lot faster than a public entity can move under these rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7784.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the plan, Medford would reap all the benefits intended under the previous idea and still retain control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7791.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe it's an effective approach because it clearly spells out each expected item and it could be implemented without unnecessary delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7801.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it was a good discussion that we had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7804.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine did a great job working in town with people, Mark and Howard back and forth covering the issues legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7812.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with help from, you know, legal in town, I think we've come up with a plan that allows us to go forward and to get this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7821.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7843.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7845.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anything we put in there, the respondent has to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7849.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7863.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or... Well, one would think that if they're paying prevailing wage, there's no reason not to use... Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7885.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done all our projects that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7888.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I did read in the emails that, you know, like all these universities, they seem to think they have no money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7931.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, because in order for it to work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7934.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: based on our concept of an interaction with an area university, we would want one in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7940.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they weren't in the area, it would become very difficult to have the interaction that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7945.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And probably would not be attractive to a non-area university to want to rent one of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7958.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say you've got to have a radius of so many miles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7963.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could come up with that, but I wouldn't expect it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7969.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could specify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7977.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't see us, the benefit to us is to have a university that's accessible to our teachers, accessible to our students, accessible to programs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8002.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they can go out and do it and attract a vendor without going through multiple layers of, you know, bidding and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8012.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since the money will be the same, I mean, it's up to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8016.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we might even do better because essentially they can work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8020.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can work on the numbers with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8026.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8028.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's on the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8029.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8049.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done RFPs before, and RFP is a standard operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8059.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's a little bit different than we started out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8061.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8062.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, RFPs are generally a very interesting tool, because you're not stuck strictly on price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8067.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're able to look at criteria, and you're able to look at who can provide what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8072.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since this is a lot of qualitative interaction that's involved,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8075.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to be able to look at the criteria rather than just strictly a dollar factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8086.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8087.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may take a little bit more time to actually construct the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8091.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go over it very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8092.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But once it's out, it's two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8098.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be each week in the newspaper, in a prominent newspaper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8111.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone shows up that we haven't thought of, let's be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8117.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we may get surprised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8118.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8152.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's walk through it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8154.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8155.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an entity wants to use the item, they certainly want to play on something that's quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8161.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They certainly don't want to play on something that's less than quality if they can help it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8164.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8165.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, they have to meet NCAA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8168.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which will immediately ensure a certain level of quality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8172.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three, we'll have a clerk of the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8174.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure that they follow certain specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8176.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8222.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8224.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8225.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, because it's an RFP, we have a lot of factors with qualitative discretion in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8233.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just price.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8237.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that already has physical facilities, they're not coming to us for another one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8242.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have a university that doesn't provide certain programs in areas that we're interested in, they're not meeting another criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9073.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9075.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just heard Kathy Medaglio tell you that they've balanced special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9080.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You heard Paul Teixeira tell you that they've also allocated EL students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9085.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those students can't go into the partial lottery because they've already been balanced, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9091.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what's left are the students who we'll call typically developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9095.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students who have, you know, just basically doing their thing and don't have a designation as either EL or special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9103.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not part of that balance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9105.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you can look at it in different ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9107.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can say that three of the schools have done some of their job, and they've sent some people to the school, and one school didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9115.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's partial lottery going to the school that didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9118.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, you encourage people perhaps to never send anybody, figuring, well, their chances are better if they don't send anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9128.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you can say that you have a school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9132.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's a natural feeder into the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9135.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The McGlynn Elementary is a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9137.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe you could take the 10, 15 kids that are still there and say, well, at least they're still in the same building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9142.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9143.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another way of looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9145.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A third way to do it would be to take all three of them, put them in the pot, and pull them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9149.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever you do, someone is probably not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9154.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During the course of the year, we have heard repeatedly from you about some people that wanted to move from one school to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9163.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because they had all kinds of issues with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9165.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I, you know, okay, I'm not going to argue that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9168.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had all kinds of issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9170.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's incessant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9171.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So somebody who maybe doesn't get what they want is not going to be happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9177.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea that we could move some people in cohorts was a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9182.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9183.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's one of the biggest reasons why people go to one school or the other and want to be with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9189.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's another way of looking at the lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9193.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you move the rest of the McGlynn over, they're all with their friends, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9198.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you, in fact, go with some of the other places, you've got to take a significant number of people from one school in order so they have friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9208.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you put all three into the pot, there's a chance that, and you're looking only for 15 kids, there's a chance that the school that doesn't send anybody might only have three friends, might only have two kids that anyone knows, because the numbers could skew back to the other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9223.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So no matter what you do, there's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9227.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be a tradeoff someplace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9229.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've just got to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9231.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've just got to decide what's going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9233.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both good schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9236.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have the same curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9238.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They both have people that will give them leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9242.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's up to us as a school system to work hard to rebuild some of the thinking and work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9250.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to make a decision because we've got to get on with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9252.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because people are scheduling, there's resources that have to be allocated, we're working on a budget, and we gotta know what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9290.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9291.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9294.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's stretching it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9296.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9297.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've taken care of siblings at this point, haven't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9304.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we took a good eye to look at siblings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9306.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And plus, there's going to be a few new people coming in, you know, between now and the end of the year, and a few people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9310.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to happen, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9311.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9423.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that we've talked about all these things, Mike.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9426.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't like, you know, this is the first time we're discussing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9429.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9431.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is there are some dynamic forces in the background that created maybe some preferences that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9439.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, historically, balance has shifted between the places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9444.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful with some changes at one school that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9449.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This won't be a permanent situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9450.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This will change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9452.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any one point in time, at any one point in time, is it necessary, what do you call it, to, you know, hang our heads and say we didn't do it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9464.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, is choice more important right now than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9468.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: making sure the schools are balanced so the teachers have enough kids in the classroom, and we need to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9547.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we want to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9548.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vast majority of people got their choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9550.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a percentage right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9552.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now you could use the NBA rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9554.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to play the NBA game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9556.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas some schools have a weighted number versus other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9560.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might say that a school that has no one going there would have to send more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9565.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A second school might send, you know, which has more kids going, might send less, a smaller percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9571.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a third school, which has even more going, might send an even smaller percentage so that no school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9577.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: gets hit totally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10224.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The plan you approved when we put this in front of you was a partial lottery, and the partial lottery spoke to the issue of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10234.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It actually listed the concept of disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10237.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If one place did not send anybody, then that place would be the partial lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10241.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's a total lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10244.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can get around it a little bit by saying, okay, we'll wait it a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10252.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with, you know, to some degree, because it's an experimental year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10256.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point, you've got to deal with the concept of partial lottery, which is based on disproportionality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10265.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because one other point you want to make is that if you send, let's say you only send two kids from the Brooks, then what are you going to hear?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10273.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My kid has no friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10275.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you send a group over there, at least you've got, the kid's got some friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10279.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a, you know, that's a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10286.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10331.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're going to get some people walking into the 12th Tower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10334.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the summer, you're going to have some walk-ins and you're going to have some people leaving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10338.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the number's not going to be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10340.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: change the balance, but you will get a few more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10342.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone new coming in is going to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10344.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10636.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the number doesn't have to be perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10637.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's never perfect one-to-one every year, even when it was working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10641.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get a number that brings it closer, and you have less pain that you're inflicting on people that might not want it, you probably can live with 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10649.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably could live with 15, and then there'll be other kids coming in during the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10656.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that's probably a good compromise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11574.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can clarify it by simply saying the only electronic communications allowable will be those for emergencies or for personal in nature, but not anything that impacts the discussion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11589.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School committee business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11591.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that way you, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11593.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That way you cover it, because obviously it's an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11595.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11596.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something's happening in your life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11597.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11602.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cover what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11606.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I mean, I think that would be for, you know, affects the general operation of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11613.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not our business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11615.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you wouldn't want the difference between someone telling you how to vote on a particular topic versus someone telling you that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11622.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they can't hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11735.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, one of the things you do have, people can under community participation provide me with a document that they want me to introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11742.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily present it, but I can distribute it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11746.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another way to say if you have a document or some position paper you want the committee to take under consideration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11752.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You send it to the office by such and such, and we'll distribute it for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3624.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, at no time have I ever said that the McGuinn was a bad school, that the McGuinn teachers did not accomplish things, the McGuinn teachers didn't do a good day's work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3640.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time in my role,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3642.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I question certain things from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3645.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3647.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm supposed to ask questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3649.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3651.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, when this situation took place, the one person who took the direct heat for it was me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3658.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the comment that I try to deflect the blame is clearly not true, and everyone knows it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3664.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't throw anyone else under the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3666.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took all the heat myself and accepted full responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3672.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, a police investigation is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3675.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask a lot of questions, and I was asked a lot of questions about a lot of possible scenarios, and what the climate was at that school, and what might be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3685.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read the report very carefully, you'll see there's a lot of gaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3689.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of those gaps do raise questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3692.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And before I go on at this point, Mayor, I'd like to ask the police chief to come up and explain the nature of a police report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3699.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to tell you that I answered questions that were put to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3704.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who declined to answer questions and declined to reveal things, but I didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=3712.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief, appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4191.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to continue for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4193.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the chief pointed out, I didn't name a single individual at that school or anywhere else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4200.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that I thought was responsible for anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4203.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I took the blame myself, even though I never saw the clip, I had no chain of custody of the clip, and I had conflicting opinions coming at me from all angles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4215.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I took the blame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4217.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if anyone feels offended or upset, or feels that I did finger them inappropriately, then you have my apology, because that is not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4229.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My intent was to aid the police department in their investigation, as the chief said, to leave no stone unturned, to let them know everything that was going on in that school, everything that was happening, because who can possibly know all the things that might have been possible at that point in time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4248.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My goal was to aid the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4252.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's tough enough some days for all of us in our very respective jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4259.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I didn't go there with a lawyer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4261.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't ask for any representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4263.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just simply answered the questions and provided the information that was asked of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4270.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And once again, if there are members of the faculty who feel that I offended them, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4277.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you is a dedicated professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4280.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no doubt that each of you wants to do a great job for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4285.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, as I look out, because I've been around a little while,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4289.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've probably hired most of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4291.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably was the person who signed your employment letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4296.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, I believe that the McGlynn can be a good school and is a good school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4302.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some differences this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4304.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's factual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4306.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't brand new this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4309.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I believe going forward that good things can happen and that if we all put our mind to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4317.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to make a difference, and it's going to work out just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4322.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4324.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4328.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mike, do you want to say something at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4331.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a person with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6945.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try to address this a little bit so we can clarify these things for everyone's benefit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6952.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have had a very extensive conversation with Dr. Edouard-Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6958.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She met with us before she toured our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6962.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a good exchange of ideas of what was necessary to happen so that when she came aboard, she wouldn't be mired in doing a lot of functional and organizational things that would take an extraordinary amount of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6978.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a number of open positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6981.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any departmental position that got hired would be subject to the professional status law, which means they only have one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6993.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if in fact they did get hired, they could be replaced within that one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6998.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second piece is that to leave all these things for an individual to come in would destabilize the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7005.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have after school programs, a director of early childhood is leaving, they run the after school programs, they oversee the family network.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7013.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All these things have to be taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7016.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7017.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the mayor and I have talked considerably about including people in the discussions, including Mr. Osborne, so we can promote diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7027.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can assure you that the way we hire administrators is they always come before you, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7033.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These major administrative positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7036.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you get a chance to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7038.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that Dr. Edouard-Vincent will have every opportunity to input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7042.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we stop our business right now, in July,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7047.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our successor is going to have one heck of a responsibility to put things together in two months, less than two months before school opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7056.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not a desirable outcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7058.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, there are a whole pile of responsibilities with teachers and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7064.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leaves of absence, maternities, all kinds of things that have to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7070.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7072.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want to drop that on your new person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7075.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you're going to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7079.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that Dr. Edouard-Vincent's going to be involved, because I'm rooting for her success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7085.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7087.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to finish strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7089.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only reason I'm needing to stay on is because there is a gap, not because I wouldn't have something to do if I wasn't in this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7101.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As Mrs. DiBenedetto pointed out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7104.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I probably wouldn't work 25 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7106.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd probably work 80 hours a week or 60 hours a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7110.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to work it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7113.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having the level of authority to do what needs to be done, to put things in place, to handle the collective bargaining that has to go on at this point in time is in your best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7125.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can sit back, not do anything, but that means my successor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7132.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is gonna have an awful lot to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7134.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would rather she comes in to a stable environment and have the opportunity to move her ideas and programs forward, and I will root for her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7143.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will work with her and give her as much support as she needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7148.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But not to take care of the routine business of this school system, not to ensure that the partnership, some of the things that are on tonight's agenda, won't go forward, would be a disservice to you, to the community, and to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7161.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I respectfully request that you allow me to do what I have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7167.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that you'll be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7170.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that she will be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7172.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I can assure you that any decision we make will be something that's collaborative and not an individual decision on my part, except for the routine kinds of things that have to happen day to day to keep the school system in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7188.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7191.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to assure you that that's my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7194.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's finish strong together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7196.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a good balanced budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7198.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's put a budget together next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7200.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be reflective of the things that you want to see and that will give our new superintendent an opportunity to innovate and do the things that will make the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7210.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7264.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The world is filled with rumortism, and that paralyzes everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7268.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is that this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7272.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community needs me to help, I'll be available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7275.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If my community doesn't need me to help,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7278.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with or without compensation, of course, then that won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7283.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly won't be a trucee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7285.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I've got to believe that a new superintendent is going to have a lot of questions once they get into the weeds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7293.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm a phone call away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7294.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I live down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7296.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm more than happy to help, because this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7300.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been superintendent and been in this school system longer than some people in this room have been alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7308.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7310.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't intend to reject my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7313.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't intend to walk away from my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7316.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't expect, necessarily, that I would ever intrude on the prerogatives of my successor, on the school committee, or anyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7325.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But will I be helpful?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7327.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7328.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to build on a very firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7332.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect the school system to progress and do well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7336.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm not walking away, but I'm not intruding, and I'm available if I'm needed, and I will help wherever I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8469.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quick summary is that under school choice, people can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8477.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come to our school district for a very low amount of money if we have open seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8482.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the cost that we would receive or the compensation received is not worth it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8487.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we would have to educate people that would take seats from other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8492.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just doesn't work under the current rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8495.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're a school system that has such open seats and you have no revenue coming in, maybe it makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8500.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not our situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8503.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to notify the state by a certain date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9255.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me add a couple of other dimensions to this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9258.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you take the next two weeks, remember the principal who we are all talking about a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9264.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: who needs to think about it in terms of his own personal needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9266.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, he's obviously a person who has to weigh all his situations, but we've had discussions and, you know, I think over the next several days we'll get an answer, that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9278.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second piece is that, we haven't done the numbers, but I have, is that the class size is at the McGlynn right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9285.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you were to go to class size, you're probably like 14, 15 in the class size, whereas at the Andrews, it's closer to 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9293.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe smaller class size is another attractive feature that's there for some people, not everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9301.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And thirdly, you know, if people would like to consider staying there with their friends and they go in a cohort, as Paul mentioned, you know, and have their friends go with them, because we've heard that before, that might do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9313.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a suggestion, over the next two weeks, we do what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9318.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9320.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go over the principalship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9323.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: make a serious effort, but at the end of two weeks, when we come back on the 21st, you gotta act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9329.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You gotta act because we gotta get in the business of doing business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9331.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to, you know, there's things to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9333.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes hard decisions have to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9336.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we don't need a one for one at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9339.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to be exactly even, but they have to be close enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9343.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be within 15, 20 kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9346.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's a reasonable differential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9458.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9460.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight you saw some teachers come in from Lubbock Line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9463.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we said before, and as I think we all agree, there's some terrific people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9468.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be that we send a few emissaries over from Glen Middle to talk to some of the elementary school kids, and maybe they can talk about their programs a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9476.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Talk about some of the things they'd like to do, and maybe that's a piece too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9480.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's four or five things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9483.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a guarantee, but it's worth a shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9488.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to be prepared that some people will say no and some people will say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9493.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another issue that we've got to deal with is not specifically this one, but it's an issue, and that's the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9500.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have, you know, emailed me and other people have emailed me ad nauseum, no offense, about a person here and a person there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9510.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are 12 people who wanted that shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9514.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we do it for one, you know, out of turn,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9518.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to send some other people unhappy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9520.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9521.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what the numbers actually present in the seventh grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9525.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a better sense of what the seventh grade is like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9527.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe with the new principal, that would be a positive, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9531.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But before we start taking any one person out of line, I think that's something else we need to be careful about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9549.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say the 21st we should be ready to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9553.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should, you know, give you an idea towards the end of that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9556.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that it's either happening or it's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9822.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10674.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you remember in the fall, there was a situation in which one of our players got hurt and there was an issue about whether the trainer at Beverly High School properly attended to this individual and what was going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10687.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So subsequent to that, we've done a number of research items and we've talked about things and I want to read a statement so that the record is clear as to what we think happened and that Mrs. Simonides has some comfort as to her considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10705.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This email is intended to provide, or an email at the time, information regarding the soccer injury that occurred during the game at Beverly High School this fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10715.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Consultation with the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association tells us that the organization considers the situation to be a local matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10726.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The requirement to provide certified trainers does not cover all sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10729.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Football and hockey do require a trainer to be present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10732.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but other sports do not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10734.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This includes soccer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10736.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MIAA suggests that coaches and referees must take responsibility to determine if a player should not re-enter a game after an injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10744.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost for certified trainers at every game would be prohibitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10748.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, Medford will intensify its training of our coaches and consider hiring an assistant trainer for certain sports to supplement our current staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10757.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Coaches will be instructed to exclude any Medford player who suffers a concussion or any other major injury unless the player is properly examined and cleared by a qualified trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10768.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any student who suffers such an injury will require a written follow-up report and a subsequent examination by a qualified physician.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10775.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is also important to note that under MIA rules 56.4, that a trainer, if present, is responsible for both teams when the medical person for the visiting team is not on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10787.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Beverly Public Schools has indicated they will not be rehiring their current trainer going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10794.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have advertised for contracted training service for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10798.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford Public Schools will initiate a discussion with the Northeast Conference Schools on the issue of appropriate trainer coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10805.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that the above steps are a significant response to the issue, and additional steps may emerge after those kinds of discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10813.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10814.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides for her diligence on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10818.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our on-field cameras, evidence, and subsequent investigation supports our interpretation of the events at Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10824.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate her commitment to ensuring safety for student athletes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10895.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would say that ultimately it doesn't need a problem because we'd be paying the bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10901.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, I think they could say, oh, you've got to have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10904.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that how many sports do we have, Bob?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10909.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 21 sports, and let's say in every season there's four or five sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10912.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you'd have to have people at every event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10915.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's JVs, there's freshmen, there's all kinds of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10919.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10920.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one way to do it is to differentiate staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10923.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do that with education too in many ways, is to make sure that the people who are on site know enough to respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10932.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to take youngsters out of games and not just listen to the kids saying, I want to go back in, I want to go back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10938.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or to call for medical help and get the youngster to medical help on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10944.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some sports are obviously more combative and more physical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10948.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a higher likelihood of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10951.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a balance wheel here that we can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10954.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we hire another assistant trainer or some of the time for some of the sports, we will have gone a long way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10959.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we intensify our coaches training,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10962.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we worked with the trainers who from other communities will have gone a long way to at least cover the basics that need to be covered and then move from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10972.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think, you know, if you think about a trainer, a trainer is going to cost us $60,000, $70,000 a piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10977.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's not like it's a, you know, a small investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11018.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So typically the home team provides the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11022.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But on that day, for example, there were at least three games going on simultaneously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11026.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So trainers on three different fields, moving back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11030.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's obviously a situation where, you know, more is always better, but still, there can be a lot done to mitigate an injury by a person who's watchful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11045.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not putting a youngster back in the game, calling for medical help, doing what they have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11050.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can go a long way with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11051.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's very rare that we have a situation that would be totally medical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11059.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like in football, you have the ambulance on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11061.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ambulance is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11062.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11064.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other sports, it's more of the, let's say, less, let's say, lethal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11077.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, you get concussions and the like, but usually it's not, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11083.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it depends on the injury, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did she already have it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11096.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, because I gave it to her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11245.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they'll be cleaning it up, they'll be painting, they'll be doing lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11298.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we've talked a lot about is inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11303.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has a center for inclusive education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11307.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lesley has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11308.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: specializations for the kinds of things that we have been talking about over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11314.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got specializations for social and emotional learning and trauma and things that we can't have the expertise locally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11322.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just too extensive, but we can work that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11327.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President of Lesley College actively participated in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11330.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not low level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11333.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that their proximity to us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11337.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the type of programs that they specialize in, the type of university they are, because universities have specializations, is a great fit for what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11347.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also provides us opportunities for professional development for our teachers, professional development for other staff members, and it provides possible some opportunities for adult learning as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11359.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's this tremendous potential here that will be cost effective,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11365.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that will not interfere with our otherwise operations and will help us upgrade our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11371.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a win-win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11372.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to move forward because I don't think we're going to get this opportunity again because they're going to try to find something else if they can't work with us and they've got a short window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11382.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we just want to, we just think it's something we should be supporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13565.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another aspect of it is the fact that in some cases we have programs like the TLP program that needs its own person to cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13577.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some other specialized programs so that the schedule around them requires a little differentiated staffing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13585.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=137.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have an answer for you very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=279.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was that Empower program where they were having kids do more things to help the kids who were not doing as well to get some additional assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=624.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Want to answer that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=625.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=626.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bistro 489 is well on its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=628.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few more things that have to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=630.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some parts that were not immediately available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=634.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're also adjusting the bathroom for security reasons so you can go directly from the bistro into the bathroom rather than going into the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=643.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There have been a couple of events up there, but we're very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=647.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that this Friday, I want to make a tentative announcement, but this Friday prior to the marathon,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=655.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Crystal Campbell Foundation will probably have some event there Friday morning, and I'll give you information about that tomorrow when I get that straightened away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=664.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's operational to a degree, but full operation probably another week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1067.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So our intent is to take each one of these items, do a cost analysis, and do a feasibility analysis for you, and perhaps in some instances provide an alternative where the cost may be excessive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1081.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of these things are, you know, like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1084.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The duplicative and the initial fronts, you know, tap cards are very, very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1089.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're talking extraordinary amounts of money for that, to do that, all the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1093.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the metal strip is very inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1096.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have to ask the question which one of these two could be done quickly and, you know, efficiently and provide the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1104.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also want to be careful who you give keys to, don't give keys to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1111.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and give you an analysis and a cost factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1114.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of it will go to budget, like Councilors and things of that type, and some of it will come to you over the next two months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1211.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would give you an idea of what it would take to put something in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1214.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So something that would take construction, obviously would take longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1218.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something that could be done just simply by adding it, wouldn't take very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1222.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then it would be a process of, you might say this is a two month project, when it's approved, if it's approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1230.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1240.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to use them too because the other factor is is that it's nice to have a tool But if you don't know how to put it on or apply it properly, it doesn't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1342.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, as a result of all this activity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1344.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we are spending an exceptional amount of money on additional personnel for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1350.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've already spending in excess of $3,000 a week over and above what we budgeted for just security monitors in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1359.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you cover every door, you just keep adding to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1364.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got a person at the door 31, which is down towards the physical education section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1372.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got somebody in the front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1374.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be very important for us to try to figure out what's the balance between covering every door and how much money we're going to spend, because it's not sustainable in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1383.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think, you know, let us talk about that and come back to you with a report, because I think it's really a mistake to just simply putting people at every door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1390.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd get ourselves in a situation where it's expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1400.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a monitor in the front door of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1403.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a monitor at door 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1404.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the pool door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1406.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is the vocational door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1408.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody you add costs money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1410.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a motion on the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1412.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to decide how much we're going to put out there at this point in time and where it's going to go, because you're raising the cost of security substantially at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1423.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these things weren't budgeted at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1433.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a secretary doing the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1436.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's, there's an issue with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1439.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1440.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk about, I mean, look, it's, it's, it's money that you want to spend, we'll spend it, but you've got to understand that every possible door in this place, if it has a security monitor, you're going to keep raising the, the level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1566.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a choice we have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1568.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've heard people advocate strongly for the pool door to be covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1573.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've heard people advocate for people coming through one point of entry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1579.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It never was a monitor at that door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1581.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was only the buzzer system and the rapture system inside the vocational school office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1587.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That would be new to put someone at that door specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1590.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can do whatever you think is in best interest, but if we keep adding layers and layers of people, we're going to have to assume that cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1598.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1708.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can assess the flow during certain times of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1712.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly in the morning, there are people using the pool facility and other things of that type down that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1718.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other times of day, people do come through there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1721.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but there are people coming through the vocational entrance or wanting to come through the vocational entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1725.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are going to be people wanting to come through the bistro entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1728.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people wanting to go to make way for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1730.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people going to go to a lot of different entry points because it's more efficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1735.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty for us is to determine, you know, which is the most necessary and how much we're willing to spend on having people in that category or how much we're willing to rely on the cameras and the Raptor system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1749.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the buzzer systems to be the most, let's say, likely form of check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1763.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There aren't motion detectors coming in those doors, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1765.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are motion detectors going in some of the rooms that trigger the lighting, but not the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1772.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you go in the vocational office, there is a whole panorama, as you know, of cameras, of television screens, that you can see every door coming into the book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1783.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So theoretically, a person sitting at a desk, if someone coming to the door, could recognize a person, just like they do at an elementary school in many ways, and let them in and tell them to come to the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1796.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, it's an issue of how much we're prepared to do for security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1815.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can certainly ask to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1816.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, they're doing other things and getting out of the movement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1820.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are certain times of the day when movement through there is more likely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1842.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 43 doors in the high school, all the doors would be open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2652.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2718.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the two days?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2897.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe I can just add a little clarity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2899.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that you're looking at a half year thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2901.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You said December 31st, but you're really looking at half year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2904.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The half year, believe it or not, is not December 31st because teachers are generally on a 10 month year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2911.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't you say the half year whenever that falls, the next meeting, and then at the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2918.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2918.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you'll get a full picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2965.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2965.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking for a payroll report, if it's the mid-year, you'll get the payroll report that falls at the mid-year, typically the end of January, beginning of February, typically is the mid-year for the teachers and everyone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2976.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the bulk of the payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2978.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other report, you'll get a payroll, maybe the last payroll of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2984.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you'll see the, you know, all the payments that are made at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2988.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, because of the way we're, it's kind of interesting, because of the way we're, we deal with faculty and others, they get a balloon payment at the end of the year because we defer payments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2999.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But some of the negotiation requests, which we'll talk about later, could alter some of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3005.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a little tricky at this point in time, but I'm sure we can provide something that would give you a sufficient look at who's getting paid and what they're getting paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3015.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you need to be careful how you try to translate it across the lines because it doesn't add<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3021.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just times this, times that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3024.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you just want to be careful that you don't try to infer things from it because it may not be exactly the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3031.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each person's payroll may be slightly different because of the type of contract they're on and the type of payout that they get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3047.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Usually it's an alpha listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3049.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An alpha listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3100.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you get a good picture of things, and obviously you'd see everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3829.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a person makes a complaint or brings it to the attention of the principal, if you look at the back of this thing, there are forms that a person needs to fill out and follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3839.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they don't bring it to our attention, we may not know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3842.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you do, we'd have a record of this forum and a resolution on what was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3847.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's pretty extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3850.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, every year when the administrators come back from the summer and they get ready for the year, part of our orientation is to go over these materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3861.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do go over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3862.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, it's building base to go over them with your people in the building to make sure that they are familiar and that they're willing to use these things when it's brought to their attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3872.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The incidence of cyberbullying has been out there for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3876.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And social media, as you might imagine,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3880.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difficult because people are constantly commenting to each other and sometimes you're not sure when someone's aggravating a friend or they're actually bullying them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3893.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to do more with that because it's very difficult to control that because it's so personalized by people calling each other up and doing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3902.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think people are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3904.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think sometimes it doesn't hurt to refresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3907.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt to go back over it again, make a bigger issue out of it, maybe hold a couple of forums on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3913.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly it's a shared responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3916.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School alone can't stop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3918.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents have to be aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3920.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students have to be aware of it and report it when it's happening to them, especially the older ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3925.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to make it a shared responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3928.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3930.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the important thing is that if it is reported to us that it's properly followed, we follow up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3937.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people are brought in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3939.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are consequences, we deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3941.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other factor is that we file discipline reports with the state every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3946.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there was a situation where a person did something that rose to the level of requiring discipline, that would be part of the filing with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3954.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's one of the categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4258.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, they're generally handled by them unless it's going to something more serious and reaches a point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4263.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Mr. Johnson's here, maybe he can give us a quick snapshot of what happens at the Roberts since Cheryl was here about the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4298.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Johnson's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4298.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe he can give us a snapshot as to his experience with the Robertsons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4812.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the sleeping dog in the room is the fact that social media also brings out the worst in parents and citizens who bully each other on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4824.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you don't have to go very far on social media to find out that adults are pounding each other on a regular basis, and they're certainly setting bad role models for their young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4834.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a bigger issue than schools, because social media has provided a forum for adults to insult each other on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4844.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've seen it on recent months and weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4847.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just people saying things that are really horrific, and then you expect kids not to do the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4853.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4854.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a bigger issue than just the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4856.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really something that has to come into the community and people have to say, social media provides opportunity, but it also provides a downside if it's not used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4866.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The lack of civility that seems to exist in these days is quite apparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4872.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do something about that because we are the role models for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4877.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4878.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: using that role model particularly well, what do you expect the young people to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4882.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll do exactly the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4977.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call on our assistant superintendent to read this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5808.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5809.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to point something out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5810.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As these reports come up, these reports are really great transition reports for my successor because they talk about what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5818.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They talk about what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5820.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just so you're aware, these are the kinds of reports that I would forward to the person you select going forward so they can actually see what the departments are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5830.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as they come in, so put them over because it also may inform questions you may want to ask as you continue to go through the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5839.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because these are the kinds of things that are really specific to the school that a person coming in might not know off the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5847.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I just want to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5848.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, Nicole did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7164.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So normally you would take the recommendation of these experts in the field, your department heads,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7171.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: unless you had such a severe difference of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7178.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, they're working every day with the teachers, they're working in the classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7182.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Science is a hands-on learning experience, and that's experimentation and inquiry is the heart of science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7189.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the great criticism of a lot of the standardized tests that our young people have to take is that they're paper and pencil, and they're not inquiry-based.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7200.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fact that the elementary program is going to become much more inquiry-based and much more hands-on should be a plus in everyone's mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7209.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty has always been getting publishers to do that because it requires a lot more work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7214.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It requires a lot more planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7216.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what they've always tried to do is just simply give us something and say, we've covered the material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7222.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From what I can see, dealing with Rocco and the science faculty so far, is that hands-on is the way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7230.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And right now, the premier program, as Rocco has identified, is false.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7235.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would not want you to move away from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7238.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the decision is ultimately yours, because we make a recommendation, and you either accept or reject our recommendations for curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7807.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7809.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a quick comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7810.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rocco's done a terrific job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7811.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can tell how thorough it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7814.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're very pleased to have him in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7819.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of good people in these roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7821.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of good people in Rocco and, you know, and... Nicole, Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7829.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Chiesa, you know, both did a great job in Tony World, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7832.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this forms the basis for succession and transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7837.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to see this, because when you're listening to interviews, sometimes people don't know all the things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7842.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, I bet you the person interviewing the other night probably didn't remember half, didn't know half these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7848.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7849.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's quite a bit going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7851.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And talk about partnerships, they're all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7854.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just keep that in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7855.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you go through these things, keep this in mind that a lot of people are doing some terrific things that the next superintendent will inherit and build on, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7867.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just important to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8374.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have several people that have known, told us they're retiring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8377.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other people who haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8381.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: made it formal yet and yet there are other people who don't want to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8384.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if they've made it formal and they've told us, we'll give you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8389.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they haven't, we may suspect it, but I can't, I'm not going to preempt anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8426.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8433.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's up to the mayor and the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8435.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8618.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the same thing, I've given you an updated report from early childhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8624.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which Diane and I worked with Shelly Gross earlier today to go over details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8630.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you've got some numbers and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8633.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in a nutshell, essentially, it really depends on what is the number of people at each school that want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8642.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also depends on the ability to us to retain qualified staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8650.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to create the right space arrangements and have some predictability, because in most instances, these are second jobs for people that are a few hours a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8661.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we need qualified staff to be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8663.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have some challenges with regard to who is in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8667.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some cases, we're open to everybody, but if in fact a student has need based on special needs, based on other kinds of things that may require some additional assistance that may be different, it's professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8684.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's program development in order to make the programs attractive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8689.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we recognize that at two schools, the Brooks and the Columbus, the demand is growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8694.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we're beginning to work very hard to expand it so we can accommodate those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8700.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against doing it, but it's very important to make sure that we can service people effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8705.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if you can't get the right staff and you can't get the right setup,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8709.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you don't want to open the door and then have the wrong numbers, because there are quotas based on early education and care rules that we have to follow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8719.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we believe we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8723.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got some numbers in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8724.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got some staffing patterns in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8727.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll keep you informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8729.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's premature until we get a little bit more to actually tell you what you will and won't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8738.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a need to plan this out a little bit in each school and make sure the demand is there, and make sure the staffing can be met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8745.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's reasonable to assume that we won't be able to accommodate anybody that wants it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8769.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the Brooks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8770.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, or all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8772.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, at the Brooks, there's probably going to get up to 150.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8775.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8776.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and like the Columbus will grow slightly, but it'll grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8780.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other places appear to be fairly stable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8790.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's still coming, though, because, you know, it's obviously people are starting to say, well, what am I going to do in the fall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8795.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And other people are saying, well, I don't need that anymore because I'm doing something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8800.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it's fluid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8802.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can project that at the Brooks, the numbers are going to be very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8806.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the Columbus, they're growing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8808.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the Roberts and the McGlynn, they seem to be stable right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8811.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8812.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8851.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we originally planned these programs, we looked to outsource them at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8857.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We found that the reliability of the outsourcing was not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8861.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that they had the same issues in getting people and getting people trained the way we wanted them to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8868.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also recognized that their costs were much higher and we would have to transmit that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8874.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can control costs a lot better by keeping it inside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8876.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The real issue is to take a look at the staffing, to make it attractive, what kind of incentives can we give to employees who are only working four hours a day or five hours a day to stay with us and to be trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8892.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to go on from there, because that's really the trick, to get them to move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8897.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8900.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come up with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8900.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've done pretty well so far, just that it is a difficult thing when people are working four or five hours and they want to get another job, or they can get something that pays a little better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8910.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide, you know, how much we're willing to pay based on what we're willing to charge as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8918.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also a revenue source for the school district, which offsets the cost of other things you're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8930.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll certainly give you another report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8931.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get you another report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8933.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whether we have all the answers by June, I don't know, but we certainly will give you another report, because a lot of recruitment takes place over the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8941.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as people are looking for employment or making decisions about what they will do in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8969.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I put two papers in your folder, didn't put them on the agenda because they're really just informational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8975.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report on the last day of school, which is June 20th right now based on the fact that we're not going to have another snow day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8982.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then a little bit of information on the student walkout, because it's been a little while since, I feel like, you know, just enough to give you information on what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8990.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8991.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=17.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=23.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people in the community who obviously were concerned, and so I respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=28.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a certain element of people that have certain political agendas, and I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/awwGd9-ntWI&t=33.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll move forward, and in time, everything will heal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1817.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to begin by apologizing to everyone for any disruption that my actions may have caused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1824.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, a decision was made that people don't agree with, but it also set off a whole series of concerns in the community, and that never was my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1838.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm confident that Medford has a bright future for its school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1843.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a lot of good things in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1845.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a terrific faculty, terrific administrators, wonderful supporters, people that have worked hard to partner with our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1853.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that we will get a lot done in the next several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1857.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that the new administration coming in will come and build on a firm foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1863.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor's words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1864.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the reality for all of us is to get beyond, to work to learn from this situation, and to grow together, and to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the children and families of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1877.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, we will work much more closely with the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1881.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1883.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was an exception, but I have a lot of confidence in our police department and Chief Sacco and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1889.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make sure that everyone realizes that we will do everything we can to keep our young people safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1894.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for being here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1896.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your support and I appreciate your understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9sQ1QM-0eSg&t=1899.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=62.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, naturally, you know, I wouldn't like my career to end this way, but it's, you know, but I think that we've still been able to do a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=70.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, this is 50 years, 23 as superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uKmigmiHhE8&t=95.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A decision was made that people don't agree with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1189.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1192.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Historically, the chief of police and the school system have worked very closely together on all security matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1201.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1999, when Columbine hit, the chief and I were part of a group that formed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1208.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the STARS program, School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1213.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was part of NMLEC, the Northeast Middlesex Law Enforcement Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1217.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since that time, we've worked very closely together to put together all kinds of security measures for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1225.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we communicate very regularly with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1229.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we think there's a danger, we talk and we take action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1236.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Recently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1238.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Back in and around December 28th or 29th, I'm not 100% sure of that date, a cleaning service that's employed by the public schools at the McGlynn Complex, middle school and elementary, found in the rear of the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, in the back row under a seat, a magazine clip that contained some ammunition in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1266.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is unclear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1268.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: how much ammunition was in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1270.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that it could have been, based on the chief's estimate, at least three to four rounds, but not necessarily a full clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1279.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't tell that because we don't have the magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1282.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from the picture that we were able to see, that's a reasonable estimate at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1291.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cleaning service turned it over to a custodian at the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1295.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The custodian<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1297.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: brought the magazine clip to the principal's office at the McGlynn Middle, and put it on a shelf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1305.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the report that I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1308.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, just a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1323.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1326.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School went on Christmas break on the 22nd of December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1335.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To the best of our knowledge, at least at this point, we're checking on a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1340.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Only one entity used the McGlynn during that weekend for a holiday service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1350.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cleaning service has informed us that they did a thorough cleaning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1356.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the facility, including the auditorium, which they would typically do on Fridays, and found nothing at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1367.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The service was over sometime on Sunday, and the holiday commenced on Monday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1376.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometime around the 28th, the cleaning service went back into the theater, or the 29th, I'm not 100% sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1386.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and they found under the seat in the back row this magazine clip that I just described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1394.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was turned over to the custodian, in-house custodian, whose name is Daniel Tully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1400.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Tully took that magazine clip, according to his report, and put it in the principal's office, Mr. Edwards' office, and he said on the shelf, along with some other things that were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1416.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Edwards has told us that he came into his office in and around the 30th of December to do some work and to do some cleaning, at which point he alleges that he cleared away some things that were unnecessary and may have, he doesn't know, may have discarded the magazine clip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1458.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1465.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you have other stories, I'll be happy to listen to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1468.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm telling you my latest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1476.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1477.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I had a different story, I would say that also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1480.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you what I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1483.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand, but you have more information than I have then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1488.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Edwards told me that he cleaned his office and he may have discarded the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1500.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you know what a magazine clip looks like, it's about this long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1505.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's black.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1508.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Has some appearances that looks like it could be a small cell phone, small remote control, small other electronic device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1530.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know what other items he had there and how it could have been confused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1535.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the story that he provided to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1539.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did not have any evidence of a magazine clip available to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1547.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometime in early January, Mr. Tully came to my office during his shift and told me about what he had found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1559.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him routine questions about where he found it, who was there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1565.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1568.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he couldn't really fill in much more except the fact that he found it and put that in Mr. Edwards' office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1575.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We checked with different other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1578.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at this point in time, I'm unable to identify where the chain of custody took place after Mr. Edwards allegedly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1594.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: discarded the item, or did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1597.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, subsequent to that, we try to make some decision as to whether we felt this rose to the level of a reportable incident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1611.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm told that Officer Ricciardi, who is the school resource officer, was also told at some point in early January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1620.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I'm told.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1622.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to be sure that I'm not 100% sure of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1627.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the time, we felt that it was an isolated incident, that it was something that was not dangerous in the sense because it wasn't a firearm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1641.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bullets don't fire themselves, not a weapon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1644.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No weapon was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1652.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we should take our time and not raise anxiety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1658.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, subsequent to that, in conversations that I've had with people in recent times, indicates to me that even though we did not feel it presented a clear danger, that other people do, and that they would have preferred that we made a full report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1682.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the chief of police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1684.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I indicated earlier, the chief and I talk all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1688.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no problem telling the chief anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1691.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've talked about a lot of difficult situations over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1695.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't hide things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1697.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a judgment was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1699.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that judgment said, we don't see this as dangerous at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1706.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So therefore, I take responsibility<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1711.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for not reporting it to the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1714.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I did so, I believe, in good conscience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1719.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that it was something that I needed to know more about before I raised it or elevated it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1730.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years, I have reported any number of things the chief can verify to him that I thought were dangerous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1737.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe that Mr. Edwards<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1742.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would have any motive for not turning it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1746.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: After all, he wasn't there on the weekend, didn't belong to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1752.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He has turned in many items, and Officer Ricciardi has indicated this, to him on multiple occasions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1760.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't believe he had any reason not to turn it in if he knew he had it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1765.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, since it has become an issue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1771.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially in light of what's taken place in other communities around the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1777.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have authorized a full sweep today, full sweep of the McGlynn Complex, which was conducted by Medford Police, Somerville Police, Everett Police, and Arlington Police with dogs that are weapons and drug trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1796.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we found no trace of weapons, ammunition, or drugs in the complex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1802.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm comfortable that that building is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1807.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have also initiated, in order to help the public feel comfortable, a sweep of all school buildings over the next few days to ensure that there is nothing there that would be of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1825.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are also planning this week to put together material, media, and others to talk to the public about the nature of school security, what we have in place, without getting into sensitive items, but what we have in place, and also to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1844.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have communicated with the Teachers Association President, Charlene Douglas, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1851.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's possible that I will meet with the McGlynn faculty on Monday afternoon to answer any questions they have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1858.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that our schools are safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1861.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that we do more than most school systems do to keep our schools safe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1867.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that we will continue to review and upgrade what we have if we find that there is room here to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1880.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we believe that we can go forward recognizing that the decision that I made with others in my employee needs to be upgraded in the future and that a lesson learned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1899.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1905.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1914.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, the chief of police was not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1917.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1918.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to the custodian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1920.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did talk to a couple of other people that I work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1924.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in my opinion, at that particular point in time, Officer Ricciardi did come in at some point, came to the conclusion that it was not something that warranted a full investigation at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1967.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I saw the picture last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1972.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the clip is, if you look at the clip, you can see one bullet at the top, and then there are holes on the side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1981.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chief can describe this better than I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1984.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he can tell how many rounds might be in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1988.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the person's hand covered most of it, holding it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1993.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he couldn't tell beyond a certain point whether there were additional bullets beyond<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=1998.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the 3 to 4 that he was able to identify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2033.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have notified people on all kinds of situations in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2058.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reported multiple situations over the years of all kinds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2064.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you know, one can debate whether this rose to that level<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2071.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But given the consensus that I have- All due respect, there's no debate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2146.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to respond to the notification issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2149.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're speaking about a couple of years ago when there was a bomb threat at the high school, the issue wasn't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2157.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: notification, the issue was timing of the notification, whether it was soon enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2162.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the committee decided to make it a little bit faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2166.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We notified the public about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2168.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just didn't do it immediately afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2170.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did it a few hours later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2172.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We felt that more people would be home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2174.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the committee felt differently, and we modified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2177.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as far as this situation goes, it happened during a school vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2183.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It happened when no students were in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2186.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't happen where there was a firearm anywhere near it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2191.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was a plausible thought as to how it may have gotten there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2196.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, since that time, we're all aware of what happened in Florida.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2201.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure that there's a heightened feeling that somehow that is the same situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2208.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2209.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, Massachusetts has tremendous gun laws, tremendous gun laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2214.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't buy what that individual bought in Florida, in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2219.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2222.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, from my standpoint, I made a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2226.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that decision, we have back and forth, and it was determined that that was the wrong decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2233.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept responsibility for it, and we'll go forward from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2239.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but I made the decision in good faith.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2241.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes, you know, we make decisions that people don't agree on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2245.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I thought there was something live, if I thought that students were in the building, if I thought there was a weapon anywhere near the place, my decision would have been different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2254.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I stand on that for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2256.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I apologize to anyone who may feel that I did the wrong thing, but I certainly didn't do it with malintent or reason to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2268.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: let's say obfuscate any of the information from the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2273.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll stand on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2299.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why didn't I think it was necessary in January?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2307.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we don't think that's the case, because the cleaning service that found it cleans that area regularly and did not see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2316.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clear to me that it landed there very recently in proximity to the time that it was found.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2395.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not gonna evaluate a principal in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2398.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2400.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will take actions on personnel matters as we go forward into the spring, but I'm not gonna evaluate a person in this forum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2409.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2410.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an appropriate way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2412.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Individuals are entitled to due process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2414.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're entitled to the protections of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2417.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the reality is that we will be reviewing personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2423.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be reviewing policies and practices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2426.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be ramping up some of our drills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2428.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also told the principals that the week we come back, we're going to run a special drill<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2437.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm a little concerned about it in some ways because I don't want to heighten in the students' minds that this is somehow an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2443.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But on the other hand, I think we should at least do one more drill at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2450.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might help the community understand that we're prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2453.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think for the most realities of this thing, we will evaluate personnel and situations and policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2460.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee is going to meet on Thursday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2463.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure that I'll hear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2465.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: from them pretty directly about what they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2468.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2471.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this judgment that I made won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2475.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2670.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Councilor, you've been on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2672.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you've received multiple phone calls or letters from me when situations have happened over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2680.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe Councilor Scarpelli, you have also.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2683.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone who's on the school committee knows that it's a regular practice, and we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2689.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some things that happen in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2690.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be a kid fight, something else like that, or in the backyard, or an injury, or something like that, that you just can't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2698.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: take everything that happens every day and send it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2701.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, this situation, in retrospect, was one that deserved notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2708.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the judgment that I made was not the best judgment at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2715.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2723.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants to be notified, Mr. Falco.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2725.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2726.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to be notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2728.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on situations that are serious and I should have notified them on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2776.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2777.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just want to say that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2780.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally, I tell the chief virtually everything because we have very good communication and have for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2787.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this instance, I didn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2788.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I failed in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2790.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2792.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But typically, the school committee does want to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2795.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's clear to me that I should have informed them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2798.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't believe and I think this is the key point that needs to be made and needs to be heard throughout the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2805.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe our schools are unsafe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2808.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2810.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that our children are in danger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2812.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that the school committee, the council, by paying money for cameras and other things like that, have provided quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2820.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The police department has worked very closely with us, with resource officers, with all kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2825.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We work closely with the district attorney to determine what's happening on the street on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2830.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on that heads off issues in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2836.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I made a mistake this time, not if I made, I made a mistake this time, I accept that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2842.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I believe enough's in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2845.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that if we, we dedicate ourselves to it, we'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2851.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe our schools are safe as any school in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2856.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, there are no guarantees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2859.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are no guarantees that I can give you or anyone of sound mind could give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2865.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because we live in a society that is a little violent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2868.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We live in a society that does do unusual things at times, and we do have a lot of mental health out there, and there are guns on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2876.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that requires even more, more from the people that make decisions, make decisions about these issues and these policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2883.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this instance, I accept responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2910.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will put that on our calendar for Thursday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2919.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2974.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me ask a technical question of the clerk, if I may, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2978.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted a meeting, Mr. Clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2980.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted it at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=2982.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we make a modification if the chair agrees to make that modification under the open meeting law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3031.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll communicate with your office tomorrow morning, and you can tell me whether we fall within the guidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3038.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3061.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3319.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3323.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of all the letters in ALICE, the only one we don't do is confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3330.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because everyone alerts people if there's something going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3334.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone locks down if they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3337.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone informs mutual aid or assistance when they do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3343.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone tries to evacuate if they can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3346.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the confront part that becomes of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3350.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reason it's of concern<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3353.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Think about young kids, little kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3355.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should they be trying to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3358.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are all teachers, are all staff physically able to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3363.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Will they try to confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3367.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we mandate that they confront?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3370.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot to this that needs to be thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3372.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what age group do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3375.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when do you start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3376.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an active shooter program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3377.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just a general program for bomb threats or things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3380.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3381.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3384.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that regard, who confronts and in what way, and who's able to confront, not everybody is going to be willing to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3394.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3396.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief and I have talked about starting maybe with the older kids and the higher grade levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3404.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some issues with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3405.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But look, I am more than willing to have the discussion and to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3411.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an active give and take on this subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3414.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need all the players who are going to be expected to step up to tell us whether they're prepared to confront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3421.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the other day when the Parkland situation took place, if you remember the sequence, the individual pulled a fire alarm to get people to evacuate the setting and then was going to pick them off with his gun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3439.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've heard many times, why don't we evacuate this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3442.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've told you in previous occasions that evacuation isn't always the best drill because the explosive or the sniper could be on the outside of the building, not just on the inside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3457.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all situation-specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3460.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it needs to be talked about, more than willing to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3464.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not just put out alphabet soup, ALICE, and say that's a cure-all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3469.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3471.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to get people to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3473.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's got to be adopted and committed to by the people who are going to implement it, or else it's just another training program that will go nowhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3512.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3520.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's been offered to the president of the MTA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3523.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And she hasn't confirmed it yet, but she thinks it's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3526.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she has to confirm it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3562.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's a police investigation, so I leave that to the Chief to answer that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3620.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: STARS was set up to look at school threats, the acronym School Threat Assessment and Response System.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3628.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when a school threat is identified,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3631.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or we believe it is identified, and we believe it requires additional resources above and beyond what we have, we would notify the STARS commanders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3642.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chief Sacco once headed that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3643.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure who heads it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3647.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would notify them, and they would provide us with those resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3651.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say we needed a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3653.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They might have a graphologist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3654.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a certain type of psychiatrist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3657.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would help us with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3659.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's say we needed a forensic help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3662.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are certain police departments and entities in the state that have forensic, the bomb squads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3666.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would coordinate the kind of specialized assistance that we need to make the appropriate threat assessment and then make the appropriate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3676.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we needed, unfortunately, a SWAT team, that would be the ultimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3684.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's a coordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3685.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make that point very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3687.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of people out there selling products about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3691.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: coordinating with schools and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3693.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of money being made in the school security business right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3697.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And part of it brings up the idea that we could have an uncoordinated response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3704.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the last thing we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3706.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chief and I both agree that if we have a situation that requires mutual aid or specialized assistance, we want that coordinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3716.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may not know, but I think we will have said it many times, but maybe you don't remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3722.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are floor plans on the computers of the police cruisers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3726.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are doors that are marked that people can go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3729.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of pre-preparation in place for STARS to work and for our own police to respond strategically and specifically to areas which we believe require attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3744.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we don't want is we don't want what happened in 1992.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3747.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember 1992?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3753.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1992, there was a altercation at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3760.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at that time, people came from everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3763.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Helicopters were flying over the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3764.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People were coming in all different kinds of uniforms, not coordinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3768.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that only created more problems than it assisted in helping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3773.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's very important, and I thank the chief and his comrades at NMWEC for the work that they have put in to ensure that a response of that type through the STAR system is one that is coordinated, thorough, and strategic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3798.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3799.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3800.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it occurred when students were there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3803.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would have been a full report and immediate response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3827.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to blame anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3831.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3832.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a relationship with the chief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3835.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should have made the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3843.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The next step is to continue to fortify and to continue to assess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3846.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect to be in front of you in and around March 6.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3849.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know you're looking forward to seeing me again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3852.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Attempted humor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3856.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get funding for the upgrade to all the security cameras that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3863.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded all of them so that they're now capable to withstand some of the weather issues that previously they weren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3872.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have better visibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3873.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have better ability to pan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3876.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's a distinct improvement over what we've been able to have in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3881.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll be in front of you for that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3892.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3893.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there are a lot of terrific groups that rent our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3895.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every group from Cub Scouts to all kinds of groups all the way up rent our schools or use our schools in a meaningful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3903.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an outlier situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3906.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not something that's happened frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3910.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we didn't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3911.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe I didn't handle it well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3914.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that doesn't mean we should deprive the community of the resources of the schools, which I think are very important to providing appropriate recreation and assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3923.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, shut down the pool, we just did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3925.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to shut down the gymnasium?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3926.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3928.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't live in fear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4050.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate the observation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4052.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can assure you that my conversations with certain individuals will be very direct and very thorough, and that decisions will be made about a lot of things in the next short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4130.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it was a question of coordination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4133.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not notifying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4142.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll accept that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4477.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4502.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4505.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from time to time, we make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4508.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what decision makers do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4510.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4511.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if I've made a decision that didn't square with everyone else, then I accept responsibility for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4518.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4519.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the chief will tell you that we have talked about some very tough items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4524.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there will be some things you don't know about because they're personal and they're caught up in legal matters that you can't know and the school committee gets advised of because it's not a public matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4533.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4535.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what's required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4537.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly on safety matters, safety matters, we don't brush things under the rug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4543.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now as far as people using our facilities, we can cancel every basketball game, we can cancel every hockey game, let me finish, we can cancel every game where people come in who are visiting from some other place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4557.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know, we know that in society today there are some people out there that do horrible things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4565.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can't just regulate everything that's going on all around us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4570.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you don't want to rent the school properties, if you don't feel that that revenue or that communication with the public is a good one, that can be a policy discussion with the school committee guided by some input that you want to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4582.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, our schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4585.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our schools are going to be places, they've been community schools for years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4589.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People have used them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4590.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people come in visiting from other communities and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4594.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, let me finish the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4596.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we stopped everyone at the door, the event would never happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4600.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4603.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we don't hide anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4606.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was a situation, it's unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4610.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I've said before, I'm taking responsibility for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4612.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how much more I can say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4644.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my assumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4646.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Investigation is undergoing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4648.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to conclude anything until the police finish their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4652.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4666.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These buildings, when they're rented of that type, like for example, the Japanese language school has two security guards there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4671.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pay for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4676.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pay for coverage by custodians who function as security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4681.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have custodians that are now security guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4683.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are they paying a different rate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4685.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They provide us with coverage in those buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4687.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4715.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have provided some security, have paid for some security of certain people in these large groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4719.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've mentioned the Japanese as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4721.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, not every group is paying for security, so maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4726.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=4727.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we need to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5508.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. President, if I make one more comment, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5511.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've heard the word retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5514.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be no retaliation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5515.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of legal matters pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5518.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those legal matters are being represented by legal counsel of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5525.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to indicate that somehow something is wrong because we defend ourselves in a legal setting in this public forum is wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5540.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, if there was any evidence of retaliation, I would not allow it in any way, shape or form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5547.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope you realize that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5549.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, with regard to that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5553.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are situations and decisions that are made that people don't always agree with in terms of educational assignments, programs, services, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5562.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people agree and some people disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5564.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the nature of how we plan and how we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5569.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just because there's some disagreement doesn't necessarily mean that people are at risk of losing their jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5576.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People have professional status rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5577.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have all kinds of rights under their contract, all kinds of rights under the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5583.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing's going to happen that's inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5585.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we disagree with someone on an issue, that can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5589.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that happens in almost every forum and any place you go, in any operation, there may be some disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5596.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But no one is in jeopardy of losing their job in that regard because they spoke up or said something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5603.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, I appreciate it when people speak up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5607.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I like it when people speak to my face directly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5611.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and call me on the phone when they've got something to say, rather than go to everybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5615.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5624.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5627.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there are people, Mr. President, there are people, Mr. President, who want to go and find out from the person responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5636.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are people that go around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5637.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have a problem with that in this particular point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5640.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but it does speak to the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=5642.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as trust goes, it cuts two ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8679.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This committee, the whole meeting, is already been posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8683.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Posted, all right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8684.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Location, time, and 48-hour notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8687.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you just can't change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8701.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a little easier to do, but this is our department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8703.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8739.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I want to answer a couple questions that were raised during the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8743.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important that this be public information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8748.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated earlier, I made the decision, whether it was right or wrong, I made that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8757.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did not inform the school committee or the mayor until Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8763.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8766.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the police chief and I talked Friday morning, directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8771.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure everyone understands that sequence at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8775.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8896.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Regular business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=98.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just so it's clear for everyone and anyone watching on television, the focus group for the general public is Thursday, the 15th of February, two sessions, three to five and six to eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=112.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three to five, six to eight, right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=115.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rules are that anyone can come up, there's no preferential order, no one gets any specific,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=121.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three to five minutes to make a statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=123.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't want to make a statement, you just want to give something written, it'll be taken by MASC and it'll be brought into the thing as if it were oral testimony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=132.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so any questions about that, anyone can come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=135.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're advertised, we're out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=137.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The administrators will have an opportunity tomorrow to speak with MASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=142.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The teachers will have an opportunity later in the day tomorrow and also they can participate in the general public if they choose to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=159.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not going to be televised, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=161.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intake for the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=163.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=172.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's advertised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=173.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put it out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=174.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope that we contacted you, Miranda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=177.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did you get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=177.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I got it, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=178.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=178.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So hopefully you'll give it a nice online<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=182.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prominence and we'll get it all over our media We'll put it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=656.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then forward to City Council for their<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1247.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1280.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who's using which school and when?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1284.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1331.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1333.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the committee report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1339.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the committee report, which was read, and then there's the action item on the old business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1344.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we should look at the old business item, and that's what you're voting, not the committee report you're accepting for information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1354.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just have to make a distinction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1355.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you're going to make a reference, you have to look at this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1357.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, is that you may know that Medford alumni Michael Bloomberg gave $50 million to the Science Museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1365.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have a funny feeling we won't have to cost it for our children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1638.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you were to include the ADA regulations, you have to give them a book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1642.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're not going to read the whole book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1644.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The basic premise is it's accessible, transportation is accessible, the location is accessible and supports are provided, accommodations if required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1653.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three basic principles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2619.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call up Tony Sickney, our director of fine arts, to tell us about these music awards that have honored our students for their terrific participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2896.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're very versatile as a school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2899.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just saw all the music awards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2901.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we're talking about marketing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2903.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about sales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2905.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about the economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2907.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got our vocational director, our associate director, and our teacher of marketing, DECA, Frank Owisi, here to present some awards on DECA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2916.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the achievements that the students have made in their competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=2920.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3346.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you get asked, is there anything going on at the Medford Public Schools, you have some remarkable stories tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3353.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remarkable stories tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3371.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year, as you know, we have kindergartners who register for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3376.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we begin in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3379.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have building bridges to help parents understand the kindergarten program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3384.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got all the materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3385.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're just doing this to announce it taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3389.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want to attend and see how it goes, it's a great event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3393.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps people better understand how kindergarten works in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3397.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So without further ado, I think that's answers it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3402.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maria's got a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3404.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: March 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3437.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So part of that is the fact that some of them will exercise choice options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3442.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for some reasons, they're also involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3444.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we could probably arrange a, let's say, a program that ties it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3449.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So once a choice is made, there's an open house or activity at the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3453.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That might give us the best of both worlds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3455.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3467.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy passes that out all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3511.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have that material through the Building Bridges Program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3514.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I'll ask you questions I can look at I'll get you more specifics is actually what they do So the registration will begin on March 5th 2018<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3581.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as the mayor points out, you asked that we look at housing units or complexes at 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3588.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last time we did it was 150.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3591.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is that in-between group, and there were four of them there that we looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3596.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this gives you a breakout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3598.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't substantially affect our enrollment in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3601.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We still have plenty of capacity, and this gives you an update in general enrollment in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3640.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have access to that, so we can't really tell you that for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3644.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, the numbers of people coming and going, if they take an apartment for a short period of time, they leave before the child becomes school age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3653.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if the pattern is consistent with what we're seeing, it's probably not that many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3659.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not set up for large families, and so as a result, we don't see an impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3680.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember the report we gave you was a September report, and naturally young people come in during the fall months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3687.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is really just the growth that would typically take place in the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3703.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you take a look, it's broken by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3704.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3736.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you take a look on the back page, you can see, for example, if you look at 48 Forest Street, where Forest Street is generally in the Roberts District.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3746.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3747.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, you can, you can read, if you look at the thing, if you look at Mystic Valley Parkway, you're looking at the McGlynn primarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3754.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking at station landing, you're probably looking at somewhere between the Roberts and the, um, and the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3761.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, 9th Street, again, the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3763.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so that gives you an idea of where the, where the distribution is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3775.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, these people were included in your numbers before, but they weren't broken out because they weren't by 100 units.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3781.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked to find out whether or not there were young people in the 100 unit departments, and this is the breakout that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3787.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3793.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have any questions, we'll send you the other report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3815.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another, you know, report that you would ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3818.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is Chad and Jill still here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3820.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3842.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, remember, the media program is infancy this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3845.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3845.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you see is, you see the youngsters, you know, coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3849.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we find that that requires that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3852.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at this point in time, you know, if they're not there 100% of the time, because the freshman numbers make up, you know, the largest portion of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3860.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the freshmen are there and then the upperclassmen are only there one week on, one week off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3864.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3866.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The numbers really depend on the type of SHOP program that it is and also, you know, whether they're an A-Week, B-Week, and the freshman numbers of the first column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3875.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as I indicate in the report, 40 to 60 percent of the freshman numbers will probably stay with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3881.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so that number will come down, but the next class will come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3885.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we expect that the vocational CTE enrollments will increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3890.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they'll still be within margins that we can work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3893.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we need a second teacher, we'll go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3895.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't need a second teacher, we'll pull it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3898.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one thing I did note, that auto collision is very, very low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3902.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a distinct possibility we'll either suspend that enrollment for going forward in the future and look at that area possibly for another type of shot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3911.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll see how that goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3912.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what happens as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3917.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The regional that we most typically use doesn't have that program, so that's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3924.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Others do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3925.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They might.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3927.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt it, considering the fact that if they wanted it, they would have signed up for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3964.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So budget discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3966.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3990.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: say this for sure, is that if we recaptured a space such as the auto-collision space, we might convert that into something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3998.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one caveat of that particular space is it's right on top of the media center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4002.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We wouldn't want the banging going on in that center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4007.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd go with the flow a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4009.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did I say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4011.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd probably move it to a different area near the HVAC and move something else into that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4021.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman has about seven students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4023.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Essex Aggie has four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4025.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're an agriculture school that we don't have the capacity to serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4029.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect that the Minuteman number is going to drop down in half, if not more, next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4034.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And little by little, we won't have anybody at Minuteman, I would think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4037.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4053.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to explain this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4328.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've provided you a report on the state budget as it currently stands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4334.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, House 2 is the governor's proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4337.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's proposal, with no disrespect to the governor, is generally dead on arrival in the legislature almost immediately because the legislature has its own view of what they want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4348.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although, many elements in the governor's budget will be sustained by the legislature as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4353.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are any number of things that have to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4355.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we won't really get a final budget out of the state until June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4359.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a very good idea of where the House and the Senate are going with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4364.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Primarily the Senate and the House, you know, when they get through the conference committee, probably in early June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4369.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably get a pretty good idea as to what's taking place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4372.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we won't get a real vote on it until we're into June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4377.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we work on estimates and we, a lot of these things are ideas and they're trends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4381.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to go over some of them because they have an impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4384.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they also have an impact on what might happen at the federal level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4388.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and what might happen with regard to the new tax laws that may or may not take place, and also, in fact, the new tax law that's been passed by the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4399.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's go over a couple of things so you're aware of it, because this informs our budget planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4405.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also informs our lobbying efforts at the state level, as we talk to people and ask for certain supplementals and other budgets to be upgraded as we move forward through the budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4418.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the process begins every year with a consensus budget revenue estimate, which is agreed upon by the governor and the House and Senate leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4428.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that estimate this year went up about 3.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4435.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's nowhere near enough for all the things that people ask for, but that's where they're going right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4446.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the budget itself proposed a 2.6 increase to the budget of 40.9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4453.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The main source of education funding is Chapter 70.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4458.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 70 is done by formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4460.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done by student population, by need, and all those other factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4464.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on that, we are a budget, our school, city, that is above foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4470.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most cities are, although there are a number of cities that are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4474.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're above foundation, you get minimum aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4476.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's proposal is $20 per pupil, which is a robust $93,000, which goes nowhere very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4485.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before we even think about it, $93,000 is out the window.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4490.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate and the House tend to increase that either by $5 to $10 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4495.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which still doesn't do that much for us, but it's still a little bit better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4498.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll be lobbying the House and the Senate to increase that particular amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4503.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the overall increase to Chapter 70 is $104.9 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4509.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's for 321 operating school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4512.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can see that's not a lot of money going out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4515.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can imagine the big cities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4517.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Boston, Worcester, Lawrence, Lowell, Fall River, New Bedford, places like that, with high need, get the bulk of those increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4529.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we move on a little bit, unrestricted local aid, which is not education aid, goes to the city, and that's up by 425,970.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4537.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't clap yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4541.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't clap yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4542.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the next line tells you that before you're through,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4546.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you take away the assessments and you get a sheet here, we lose $17,000 in change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4552.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're getting $17,000 in change less based on the ins and outs of the cherry sheet, which is included here, the estimated cherry sheet and the governor's thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4562.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4563.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might think you're getting your way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4565.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you hear people say you're getting all this money, you're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4568.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're getting is you're getting a balance between assessments and revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4572.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now that doesn't include things like, you know, meals tax and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4576.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's, that's a different ball game altogether, but direct aid to the city and to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4582.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, we net loss of 17,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4585.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, two major concerns in the governor's proposed budget that I want to mention is the underfunding of the charter school reimbursements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4594.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably somewhere in the vicinity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4597.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of $70 million less across the commonwealth than the formula or the entitlement formula would otherwise provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4608.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when people still rail against charter schools and enrollment in charter schools, it's because it's underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4614.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no problem with kids who want to go to charter school, go, but if you have an entitlement formula funded closer to the entitlement in every year, that hasn't increased for the last four or five years, that assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4625.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's something to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4628.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other factor is the circuit breaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4630.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The circuit breaker is for extraordinary special needs costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4634.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The way the circuit breaker works is that four times foundation, which in this instance is probably about $44,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4640.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy, roughly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4641.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, someplace in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4642.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It used to be $28,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4643.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: After you hit $44,000 on a placement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4650.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state allegedly will give us 75% back on the remaining budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4656.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say the cost of this private school is $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4661.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on that, the $56,000 delta would then be eligible for 75%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4668.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, they funded it at 65% in this budget, which means that at this particular point in time, Medford will be short somewhere around $155,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4680.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, going back to the charter school thing, the reimbursement's about $400,000 lower than it should be to Medford, based on the actual formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4690.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives you an idea that, you know, we have entitlement formulas, but they don't get funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4695.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably the saddest words in budget preparation is subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4702.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They pass a law, you have an entitlement, and then it's subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4707.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the appropriation doesn't keep pace with the entitlement or the formula, you don't get what you think you're going to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4713.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's always a tricky factor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4717.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple other variables that must be considered when planning a budget for fiscal 2019.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4725.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uncertainty in the federal budget, impacting grants of Medicaid distributions to state, city, and schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4731.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't know what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4733.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The costs of health care, always going up right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4737.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost of negotiated salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4739.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in collective bargaining right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4741.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever we negotiate has to be accounted for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4743.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The impact of possible reduction in the sales tax through the initiative petition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4749.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an initiative petition that could make its way to the ballot if it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4754.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be a reduction in the sales tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4758.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there's the fair share tax, which is sometimes known as the millionaire's tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4763.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If that were to go through, the estimate is that somewhere, the state might get $2 billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4769.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But how it gets distributed back to the cities and towns will depend on the formula that's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4777.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4779.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then of course there's the increase in other service costs, whether it be transportation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4783.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: energy or any of those things all have to be factored into budget planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4788.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is intended to give you a little bit of a appetizer as to how we have to look at the budget as we go forward for next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4798.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, it's very important that we work very hard to secure our current and potential revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4802.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of our budget is based on revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4806.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to be aggressive about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4809.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some good possibilities, but they have to be developed aggressively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4813.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to maintain and enhance them so our educational programs and services don't get cut by reductions in aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4821.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House and Senate will be preparing their budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4823.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House begins in April, the Senate begins in May, typically, and the conference committee sometime towards the end of May, early June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4830.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we typically do budget, full budget in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4834.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do pre-budgets as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4836.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the next couple of months, you'll start seeing pre-budgets come out as the department heads<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4841.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and principals and school Councilors will come forward and tell you what they think their needs are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4845.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll have to listen to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4847.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll also be in collective bargaining discussions as to what we intend to do with our various unions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4853.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a quick synopsis of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4855.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a couple of other articles to read in the back that you might find interesting with regard to budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4865.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They come from local publications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4868.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one of them state leaders are facing trickiest budget cycle in recent years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4873.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's another one back here that deals with the budget as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4877.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me see if I can give you the title of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4918.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the challenges that the city faces, you know, in funding schools and other city services is really characterized by this type of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4970.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: why don't we put it on an agenda for like community relations subcommittee meeting, which we can, and then possibly use our new media, you know, put it out there on the webpage and let people know the challenges the city faces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4981.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's really, it's true of our virtually every city in town in the Commonwealth right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4986.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that Medford does do a lot of things locally to, to generate revenue, but it's a challenge more and more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4994.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The idea when two and a half came in was, is that the state would step in and pick up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5084.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've intended to give people, you know, the inflation index numbers, you know, consumer price index, the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5089.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You give them an idea, but it really depends on what you're talking about, what the cost of a particular good and service is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5095.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some things are inflationary, some things are deflationary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5098.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, you have to really look at the item itself because the totality contains both inflationary and deflationary items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5106.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not easy to just simply put a simple number, but you can give people an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5110.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give people an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5132.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some Cambridge activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5135.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people have gone to Advanced Science, a little bit further, Marlborough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5139.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few that's better, but the big ones, Mystic Valley, Prospect Hill, and Cambridge are probably the biggest ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5145.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5146.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a listing of those at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5148.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, let's just start off by saying, because I know it's a sensitive topic, is that not necessarily against charter schools per se, it's the funding formula that needs to be sustained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5159.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, if you're going to say, well, this is going to happen, then it's got to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5164.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, it's just really just taking people down the road, and communities have to bear the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5170.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state doesn't want to take on the structural deficit, so they pass it on to the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5176.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number, that $80 million, hasn't gone up in years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5210.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5508.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just to cover that, I appreciate that Cheryl's done some research, but we need to be very careful of a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5514.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When people come in and give estimates, remember, we're a public entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5518.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to go through a bid process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5520.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to pay prevailing wage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5522.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have all number of things that we can't skirt around that maybe a contractor might say, you could do it for this, you could do it for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5529.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to concern ourselves about liability, things that are put together by people who mean well, but maybe are not professional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5538.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: might actually get it done, but there might be something that goes wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5540.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it goes wrong, we could be liable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5543.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the suggestions are good ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5545.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll look into them, but there's no silver bullet on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5549.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, people give us estimates all the time, some high, some low, but there are some other factors we have to pay attention to when we do procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5557.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make sure everybody understands it's not just a simple thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5561.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we have do things, even with the best intentions, we run into liability issues if they're not properly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5567.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5569.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So thanks for the ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5571.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's look into them, but let's be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5596.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to be very careful because if you put this interlocking rubber on top of what you've got, you've got to make sure that what's below it is properly set up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5607.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have the best intentions and you do certain things, you may undercut the ability to put these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5616.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a shortcut or two that may seem plausible at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5621.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would want to make sure that it's done right because we're talking safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5624.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also have to make sure that the diameter of the rubber is at the proper thickness for the height of the structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5636.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that, I don't know what you quoted on the diameter of the rubber, but the rubber has to be a certain thickness in order to absorb shock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5644.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, that might take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5645.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have some structures that are higher and some that are lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5648.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All this should be thought through professionally, because the first time something goes wrong, there'll be some sharp lawyer out there who will take us down the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5675.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, well, you know, let's go over together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5677.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's go, you know No, but it doesn't have to be done by hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5752.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have to sign off on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5754.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We sign off and send a letter of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6008.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Paul Texera is working on different languages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6010.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no reason why the English language one can't begin to be disseminated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6056.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When it's ready, we'll put it up as soon as it's ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6058.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6060.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6060.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to see Glenn this week anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6062.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Glenn's in Washington today, but he'll be back on this for the middle of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6384.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Glenn is coming back from Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6386.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He wasn't sure how many nights we wanted to go with focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6390.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He had set aside the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6392.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or initially, but he's available on the 13th and the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6396.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when he comes back tomorrow, I'll have a discussion with him as to whether he thinks we can do two a night or two, you know, or, or three a night if it necessary or needs a couple of days to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6407.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two a night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6409.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you have, you know, an hour for one group, an hour for another group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6411.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You are an hour and a half for one group, an hour and a half for another group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6418.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6419.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6421.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Glenn's going to be around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6422.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to set up a time as to when it's convenient for people who are in certain categories to meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6428.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like you'd meet with certain administrators after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6430.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You could meet with teachers after school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6432.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just need time to talk to Glenn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6436.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke to him today when he was in Washington as a conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6445.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6447.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6449.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll, we have to sit down and find out what he thinks is, you know, and you'll probably get that answer on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6454.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, what he thinks is an appropriate number of people to be in a focus group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6458.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cause obviously you don't need a hundred people in a room and won't, it won't give people a chance to talk, but you know, we're representative group and we have to think what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6572.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know that the applications have gone out to superintendents and assistant superintendents and other administrators across the state because I got one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6582.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6587.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A statement of her most interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6618.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a focus group of the administrators will be a collection of administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6622.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A focus group of teachers will be a collection of teachers representing all levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6627.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The community is a little tougher, and I want to take some guidance from Glenn as to how we set it up elsewhere and how we've got representation probably from each school, from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6635.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some of the other areas that have interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6638.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, you can't have everybody in the room at the same time, or it won't be much of a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6643.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody will get half a comment, and it'll be over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6645.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6650.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6650.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then when you go to the larger arena, when people have public interviews, meet the candidates, you will have opportunities for people to interact with you and give you feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6661.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6662.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to get increasing amounts of feedback, and I'm sure you'll<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6665.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once names come out, you'll start to hear from people coming out anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6725.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk to... Childcare for what event though?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6730.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can try and get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6732.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can try and get that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6734.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of other things if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6737.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thursday night, taping, 7 o'clock at the theater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6742.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, just so you're aware of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6744.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next week, we're going to start earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6747.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've sent you out an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6748.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll get a posting on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6750.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Community of the Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6751.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it'll be across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6754.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At 6?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6754.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to do it at like 6.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6755.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6758.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 6.15, Monday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6759.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 6.15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6759.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can go over some things that are associated with the selection process so that we've got some guidance, and then we can move that forward, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6770.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah across the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6771.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6771.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to book 201 201 and the other pieces is that I've Suggested that in order to give us self-sufficient time that our regular meeting started 730, so we don't feel rushed You know if we want to take a few extra minutes to go over things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6784.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important that You don't feel like you're under fire to end the discussion if you need an extra 15 minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6790.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6850.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost a record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=68.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane will answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=69.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've put things in place, but there's some things to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=71.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It still has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=182.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I could, just before you go there, Christine is not able to be here tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=188.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I may not be familiar with everything that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=191.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we could just hold it for another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=239.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Middlesex Partnership for Youth is a longstanding alliance we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=244.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally started with the District Attorney's Office, has now moved independently because of certain regulatory requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=250.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they provide multiple workshops and multiple collaborations with regard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=255.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: substance abuse, child abuse, mental health, all kinds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=258.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We run all kinds of workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=259.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's an annual membership that allows us to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=286.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me take a good look at that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=291.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Page 15 of January 12th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=295.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably a function of funds that went unused because they could not be applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=301.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes what happens, these things are for fringe benefits and the like, and if they're not applicable, we can't expend on them and then we have to return to the commonwealth at the end of the grant period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=309.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can get more specific once I get in behind it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=314.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, sometimes, you know, the categories don't match up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=342.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, it's probably for a category that we can't use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=345.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So sometimes it's more than most likely to infringe benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=349.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a person doesn't take something, we have to put it in the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=352.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they don't take the benefit, we can't expend against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=356.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to make a transfer, and sometimes they allow it, and sometimes they don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=389.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where is that again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=538.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So American Alarm is involved with our security and camera systems and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=544.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know the specifics of each one of these, but I'm sure it's tied into the fact we've just installed additional security pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=550.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I suspect that those are charges that are associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=553.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I see, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=706.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next one is not quite ready yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=740.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's on the agenda as a specific vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1108.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the estimates vary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1110.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds because we may not want to go with the same surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1117.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1124.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 15, 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1125.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to get a better estimate on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1127.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So while this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1134.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1142.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to look at a larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1144.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we can put it on the table tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1150.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll come back with more specifics and try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1159.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's probably the best way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1161.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1165.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1170.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This could be $75,000, $100,000, or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1173.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1321.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1324.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you want it on the next agenda, it has to happen in between now and the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1327.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So she has a March 2 deadline to submit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1330.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before February 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1333.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1334.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before February 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1334.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1343.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1349.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1354.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This afternoon, the mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the executive director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1363.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's quite substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1364.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you know, because we pay dues, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1373.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1374.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've put a pretty aggressive schedule together, as the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1381.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1386.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1394.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Glenn Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible and not, just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee, generally within a day, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1416.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create the circumstances in which this would go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1420.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd also work on creating focus groups and other aspects of this search site visits and other things that you may want to do or not want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1430.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1439.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is the path we're on so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1443.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1451.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1460.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1464.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1468.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1478.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He'll assist in the preparation of interviews, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1486.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went through a process of how they do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1488.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1494.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1496.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1508.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1515.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1522.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once it reaches the final stage, privacy's off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1526.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then people can see it, there'll be public interviews, there'll be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1534.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very extensive, and I think that based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that you'll see this is a very, very wide open search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1544.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intended to bring in candidates around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1547.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's in Lexington tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1548.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection and a few other communities that'll be moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1555.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1559.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1564.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quickly came to the table with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1565.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only did it last week and quickly came to the table today to work out some details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1604.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1609.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1666.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1666.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1696.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that, but we're not talking about search consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1703.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based on what I've talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1706.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1710.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's for full search done by them, totally by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1713.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already put some things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1715.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already done quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1716.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1719.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a number, but the number is not what would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1743.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1752.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an important area for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1753.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She spent over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1755.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for a replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1760.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance to look at the top three candidates that come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1769.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you'll give us feedback, and then we make an appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1773.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to get going with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1818.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1829.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts, as you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1835.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1848.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1860.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1867.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, renowned for doing some terrific programs, whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1884.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or other things that you have heard about over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1888.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to make you aware of it, because we're going to start to ramp up very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1893.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we hope that you'll all participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1896.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1905.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll also use our various media to talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities and the things we collaborate with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1913.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's just an informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1954.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've actually got some interviews going on, I believe, the end of this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1961.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1976.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The board will interview them and potentially even next week, they'll make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1986.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: will have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1994.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we'll have someone in place very soon in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1997.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When that person will actually take office, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2000.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2005.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I assume that in the interim, Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2013.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we expect that to happen fairly soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2016.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll get you posted as soon as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2027.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've named three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2029.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I want to speculate, I might have thoughts, but it would be inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2052.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2072.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse more so than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2079.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been, although, you know, it's quite a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2082.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2086.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Today, it's close to 38%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2087.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have an idea of what's taken place over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2093.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity, and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2107.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So adopting appropriate inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2114.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2119.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2121.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rather it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2128.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2131.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2139.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding, an enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2150.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2160.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2165.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2178.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing, and for us to be in the forefront of it is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2187.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good things happening in our community already, but the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2193.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be diligent with it, you can't let it slip, and we have a lot of things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2198.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it, but it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2233.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what we do is you, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it as an excuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2247.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've actually had a practice of doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2268.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2275.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people understand it, and some people agree, and some people don't agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2279.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I found the last little while, the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2288.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2288.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Generally around 8 o'clock or the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril, and we're endangering them and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2301.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2305.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the most part, people do understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2309.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2315.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2323.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to keep open if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2325.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2329.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2334.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, if conditions warrant it, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road, has to be balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2346.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with our decision to open the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2348.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2352.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they documented that they kept the youngster home because of the weather, and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way, we will provide an excused absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2365.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If, in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2376.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2380.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2385.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2393.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're entering the winter season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2395.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in the winter season.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2397.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2404.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2410.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will use our media to inform people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2414.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use all the television media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2415.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use our own media to put things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2418.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use robocalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2420.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2425.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now this last storm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2426.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: had to wait till almost six o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2431.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now I knew in this area, we weren't going to get much snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2436.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2443.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how we would track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2448.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one before, people asked me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2453.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2457.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2459.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2463.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2468.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2472.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they have young people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2477.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2483.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be a productive day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2486.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are all kinds of considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2488.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to pay attention to whether DPW and the contractors can clear out lots, whether we think that the bus buses can actually make it up and go in the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2505.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very rarely perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2507.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2510.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season and we take a look and see what's happening and we try to make decisions that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2519.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2529.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't take school closings lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2532.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we think that safety is an issue, if we think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2539.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2544.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But some days it's not, we don't know until five o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2638.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk in the long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2648.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I find that unproductive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2649.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2656.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a trade-off to give kids some homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2658.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to do homework anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2660.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is that we want our teachers in front of students, and they don't want to trade days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2665.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that, we could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2677.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2683.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2684.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2754.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2756.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We sent you out, you know, on that particular day, I sent you out attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2760.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the high school was not badly attended that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2765.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was over 80% of the people that were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2767.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2770.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, you know, plus teachers, there weren't that many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2773.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2778.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2782.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certain areas of the building were still trying to adjust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2785.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can work on the heating system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2788.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can work on different aspects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2789.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a lot of people were in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2792.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2800.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2804.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2810.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a whole week would have been gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2812.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at least we got a couple days in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2814.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2815.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2816.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John and I will check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2829.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that, check the room out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2836.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put them in the warmest place as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3134.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3138.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, just to briefly summarize it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3145.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3149.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3151.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They give up a lot of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3152.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They generate a lot of support for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3154.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very grateful and thankful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3157.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3175.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to dovetail much better with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3177.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3188.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3196.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3203.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3204.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg gives us some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3206.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3209.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess he probably wouldn't send them to me anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3211.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and I'm appreciative that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3218.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3223.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3228.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them off or you can accept them as they're written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3232.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me know what you're... Would you like me to read them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3237.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3237.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3239.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, all PTG, PTOs, and other internal 501c3 organizations affiliated with the Medford Public Schools must be registered with the superintendent's office annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3249.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registrations must be renewed by September 1st of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3254.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A registration is simply a process of recognizing that an organization exists, and if they're out in the street, that there's a number they can have, and if a person who's a member of the community wants to donate, they know this is a valid organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3268.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also know that they exist, and they're using our name and raising money using our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3274.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To all registered organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3290.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MPS 1234, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3292.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3296.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3299.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3300.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see it as it comes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3302.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3303.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3303.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see the things that will be on the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3306.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who the officers are, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3310.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where they're banking, and the likes of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3317.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3326.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we want to know that every organization has some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3330.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3334.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3336.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3342.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And another reason for that is the fact that if everyone hits the same bank,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3346.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone hits the same business over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3351.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on our community pretty hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3353.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, but I already gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3358.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important for us to know who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3361.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3393.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3394.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can make changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3397.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3398.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's like our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3399.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project certain things and changes happen during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3401.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3403.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can just send in a note, say we did something different or we added something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3407.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe it doesn't have to be that tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3409.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me keep going and then we can hit it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3411.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these things intersect with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3414.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership and how a person becomes a voting member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3422.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3423.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, a person comes to a meeting, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been working on it for an extended period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3436.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a decision people can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3442.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must identify what is a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3445.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3448.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3449.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3452.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3458.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3465.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When is it going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3466.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3468.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3474.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expenditures of funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3484.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter-indicative to the ones the school system has adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3492.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3498.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come just as the testing season's about to begin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3500.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're planning trips that are not tied to the curriculum in an important way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3506.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe once in a while, but not all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3508.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only have 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3510.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure all of them are used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3516.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The public schools through the superintendents offer training to each entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3520.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3526.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3531.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3536.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've gotta give them a form where technically you're paying them under the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3540.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3542.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3546.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What are you requiring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3548.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, tonight you asked about slips and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3551.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all heavily documented when it comes through the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3554.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are we documenting these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3557.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gives us an idea of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3560.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3570.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3574.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3579.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the general thing, there may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3596.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3601.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3608.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I guess the floor is open for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3810.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're looking at people who don't have experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3814.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3820.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3824.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a refresher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3825.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3827.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new forms that need to be filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3831.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3833.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3835.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the governance structure goes and elections, if there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3844.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you've got to let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer or how you participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3856.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And theoretically, under the school councils, you're supposed to have that election every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3861.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3862.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by the statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3864.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3868.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3868.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3880.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3884.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3885.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't consult me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3886.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what's part of the discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3888.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are people consulted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3889.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do they have a chance to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3891.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3896.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, does the PTO engage the community that it represents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3900.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3901.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think there's a balance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3903.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3914.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3917.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4000.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that the appropriate subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4003.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's, you know, let's, let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4006.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Support services deals primarily with services that support the educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4010.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is more rules of, this is more of the rules of the operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4016.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4281.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get it from the minutes, and then we'll move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6321.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe we made the adjustments you asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6324.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amounts and thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6550.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6552.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6554.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6558.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there's no such, you know, cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6563.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6568.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6602.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we'll move through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6603.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there's some people that resist any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6606.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: early this evening you're telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6610.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6610.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6614.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6615.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6626.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm trying to take it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6627.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, obviously the nurses indicated it's okay until she sees something specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6632.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if something comes up, we'll come bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6723.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Joseph Navetta was the husband of Angela Navetta, our retired secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=0.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good morning and welcome to the Marsha Caron Theater here at Medford High School for the inauguration of our Mayor, City Council, and School Committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=12.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An inauguration is a ceremony that provides us with an opportunity to rededicate ourselves, our leaders, our citizens, to the promotion and achievement of a high quality of life for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=24.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Medford, we have a firm foundation of quality that can be built upon to meet the challenges and aspirations of the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3748.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the more we can do in that account, the better off we are in helping our neighbors and friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3754.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank Wegmans for their support of our collation which will take place at the close of this ceremony at Bistro 489.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3818.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this time, I would ask the police honor guard to retire the colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3869.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please stand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3952.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we close today's ceremonies, we leave with renewed commitment and hope and confidence that our community will move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3960.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first and last task of any leader is to keep hope alive and I think today you know that hope is alive and well in Medford and we are moving forward under the leadership of our mayor, our school committee and city council, as well as our state government, the governor, our congressmen, our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3980.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: leaders in the state legislature and the United States Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=3984.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have terrific people leading us and all we need to do is get with it and support them so that we can continue to make Medford a great place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4008.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we allow our city officials and honored guests to leave, please remain seated so they can leave the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4015.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then afterwards, you're all invited to Bistro 489 on the second floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4019.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have guides to show you there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4021.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come and join us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4022.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've prepared a wonderful collation for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/mYtBXb9v-us&t=4024.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=608.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=615.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you a quick update the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=617.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm waiting to hear back from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=619.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did speak with him and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1102.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1108.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1109.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1122.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. Ronay, I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and if you'll permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1146.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1149.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1158.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students in grades three, four, and five who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1170.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1176.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what the student's need is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1178.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1182.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week, who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1190.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January, and the projected cost is an additional $6,200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1197.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1207.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1211.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1222.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1226.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1230.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be a need to create a consolidated route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1233.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, buses go in different directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1236.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1241.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1248.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1257.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1262.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make those adjustments based upon multiple factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1266.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1269.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1323.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we're planning it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1348.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1358.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be concentrated in a full bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1360.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be that we have a lot of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1362.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1379.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1383.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1387.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1391.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't make anybody participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1393.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1419.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1424.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: open it up a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1425.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's see exactly what kind of response we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1428.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1432.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I feel they can actually do that particular work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1436.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1441.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1453.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1484.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1495.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1516.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1582.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1673.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we discuss it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1735.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1764.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1952.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1965.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1971.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2020.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is something that's been in the works for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2023.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2029.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2031.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2044.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world, where I think that's a bigger need these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2743.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously, all these programs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2748.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We seek outside funding to support them long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2751.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2756.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cummings is the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2757.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a three-year grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2760.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2766.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2775.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be having other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2777.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: outreaches to different people at different times because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2794.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the game plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2795.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2802.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're already getting some great recognition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2805.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2813.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2818.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the kinds of things we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2820.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we do these things, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2830.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: meaningful projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2867.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2874.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that's happening, again something I'll tell you about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2877.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at a subsequent meeting, is the Commonwealth Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is launching what they call it Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2889.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2904.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously testing is something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2907.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we brag about as a nation, I mean, as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2915.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2921.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a good example of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2923.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2933.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they fill the gaps that many communities don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2937.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2941.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is how you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4527.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that we put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4541.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I had a good long chat with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4545.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: executives in the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4547.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And without going through the whole report, a year ago, 26 projects were approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4554.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, only 15 could be approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4559.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4565.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that a year from now, we'll be in the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4571.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4573.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We update a few more things that are in the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4575.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4580.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one of those things happens, and sometimes<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4584.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money coming from the pool is greater or smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4588.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just happened to be one of those years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4591.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4602.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It hasn't been released yet, but when it's released, we'll know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4606.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4625.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going for the core program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4627.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The core program is April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4629.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4632.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a much smaller and more targeted program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4635.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is much more expansive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4638.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has longer term value to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4644.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to come back to you for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4645.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there's anything we want to emphasize or modify a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4653.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4662.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4668.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they had to be able to fit it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4675.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4676.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4735.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4743.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's plenty of projects we could go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4744.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be going to the Council on Technology in January and a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4749.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to keep moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4751.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4776.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so this is a report you've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4780.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee has a much more detailed report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4784.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4785.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone perhaps interfering with our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4794.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the cover report speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4796.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4801.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4810.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: security cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4814.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4819.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The newer models are a little bit more resilient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4822.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4825.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Placement of external cameras on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4836.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few cameras we have no choice but to put them on metal poles because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4843.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4848.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 154 cameras across the district in our nine schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4853.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4857.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ensure security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4859.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4868.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4877.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget significant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4882.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4887.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be prudent to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it'll be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4903.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over and use it in the year that we absolutely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4910.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4916.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4925.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have specifics, I would ask that the committee wants to talk to me about it and do it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4930.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to gain the system help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras are two types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4963.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that move and pan an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4966.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that are fixed on an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4968.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4976.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4983.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The system's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4984.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They no longer run DVRs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4986.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're now more digital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4987.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things are different than when they originally were installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4992.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cabling has to be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4993.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be locked into 911 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4996.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all these things require upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=4998.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5000.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got good coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5003.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5010.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we talk and we set up our meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5019.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think at this particular point, we're in good shape and I think we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5024.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5028.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the security cameras because this is a big expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5031.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5074.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5076.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5087.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: make sure that people know that that's not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5111.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5117.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's not going to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5151.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When do we make it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5153.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5154.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be the beginning of February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5156.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get the work done, and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5190.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean sorry charge policy I'm going to call upon our director of finance and administration to talk to you about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5196.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a requirement of the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6112.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6118.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6123.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If people are getting lunches who are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6127.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: eligible because they haven't done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6142.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where the federal law comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6145.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the commonwealth that have run up balances of 50, 60, $70,000, in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6153.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Was it Wellesley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6155.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Framingham, Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6161.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to have something, but it has to be reasonable so it can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6171.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6179.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6182.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way they look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6183.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to find some way to get something on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6186.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6190.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want us to come back with something a little less, let's say, severe as far as we're looking at it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6197.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6687.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Dr. Perreault is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6689.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you two reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6692.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is on the bus situation and the other is on vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6695.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we need major discussion tonight, but I want to give you an opportunity to get up-to-date on this so you're aware of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6702.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can follow up and I'll give you additional information as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6707.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Perreault has met with us today, and we've met with the bus company, we've met with the police, we've done a whole pile of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7205.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7207.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that a little bit, because we had an interesting discussion with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7212.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems that preferred seating is the back of the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7216.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They shoved to get to the back of the bus, because that's where they can have a little more mischief, perhaps, in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7222.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say that benevolently, but I mean, they want to get to the back of the bus and they're trying to get preferred seating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7228.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally you like to sit up close and get off the bus faster, but that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7232.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously we have to have a meeting with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7235.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to make it very, very clear that behavior on this bus is really going to be monitored very closely because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7244.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just can't put buses on just simply to get more of the same, because if they're going to push and shove on an uncrowded bus, they're going to push and shove on the next uncrowded bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7253.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to make sure that they understand that this is something, it's a privilege to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7257.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying very hard to give them the transportation they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7260.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they've got to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7262.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone has to own this solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7264.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also worked with the bus company, Christine worked with the bus company this afternoon, that if in fact we needed a backup bus on a given day because it was particularly cold or we anticipated bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7275.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say it was a snowstorm and we know that everyone's going to want to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7279.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could get a backup bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7280.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in that situation, but then it costs us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7283.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we wanna do these things, we wanna have contingency plans in place, but we need the students to cooperate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7290.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the headmaster points out, we're gonna have a meeting with them, we're gonna make it very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7293.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you do things you're not supposed to do, you're not gonna ride that bus, we're gonna take you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7298.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's a situation for us is that people like to go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7304.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't be in a situation where people who don't need the ride home<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7309.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: get on the same bus, it just is not workable for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7313.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a major expense with that, especially now we're talking about adding a bus to the elementary schools, we're talking about other kinds of costs, we've had to add a bus to move some ELL students to the Brooks this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7324.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation costs are not inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7327.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It costs $375 a day for a bus, times 180 days, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7335.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to provide services, we expect people to be respectful and we expect them to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7341.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've gotta keep working at it, no question about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7344.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the injury is obviously tragic and unfortunate and we've been in contact with the family and we'll continue to be supportive to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7352.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But everyone's gotta own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7355.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just can't be, you know, whatever you do will be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7583.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing, I want to thank Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7585.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the first time in my career, someone said I was completely correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8439.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that, you know, Dr. Perreault is expressing extremely well is that this is a community thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8444.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents, everyone has to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8448.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you put enforcement in one place, they'll go to another place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8451.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll just move the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8453.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to change the outlook on the dangers about it and why it's not a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8459.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to work with the merchants, perhaps even to possibly put a city ordinance in to ban the sale of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8466.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be something that we can look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8467.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And possibly work with neighboring communities to get a regional ban in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8472.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it makes it that much more difficult to acquire the materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8476.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a comprehensive issue, but it's not going to be done by just having a person chase somebody down the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8485.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: nice for a particular situation, but not as a solution to the larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8496.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm hopeful that maybe it's banned in general, because I don't think it's good for adults either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8500.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If adults have it, they give it to the kids at home, just like a beer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8503.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're home, let's have a beer, we're watching a football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8508.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do this, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8509.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a sense that if a parent's doing it, it's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8514.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could I get that message across?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8910.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a number of presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8913.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to make each of them, and it's our custom to give everybody a chance to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8921.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8925.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let everybody say something and then make the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8927.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9588.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9593.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So having been around a long time, and having seen an awful lot of things, and having interacted with both of you in different ways and at different times, I have some perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9605.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll start with Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9608.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bob, you've been a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9610.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9612.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9613.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've come from a family with tremendous tradition in public service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9619.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An uncle who was a mayor of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9622.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a relative who was an uncle, I guess, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9630.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been on this committee through different periods of time when different activities were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9637.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You experience the sting of Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9640.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what it's like to be a teacher who got displaced, so you always have empathy for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9646.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you work for the state auditor, and you had a really good investigative mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9651.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you play Columbo in Mickey the Dunce, we know that you really know what's going on, even though you don't let on that you really know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9659.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how you play that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9664.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who knows Bob Scurry knows that Bobby really cares about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9669.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He does a lot of things that he doesn't take credit for, just quiet on the side, takes care of a kid here, takes care of a family there, and just doesn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9678.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I know about it because I hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9681.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that that really reflects on your good heart and your caring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9686.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And even though sometimes it looks like you've got that bravado coming on, you're really a soft puppy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9692.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you really care about people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9694.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're really one of these guys that you can always count on for loyalty and knowing what's going on without making a big deal out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9702.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were the secretary for the committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9704.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You went over all the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9706.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little got by you, if anything got by you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9709.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you sometimes give me a wink and say, what is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9713.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I try to dance a little bit, and you give me a wink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9716.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you say, don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9717.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I remember all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9720.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of history, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9723.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go back a long way, and I look forward to seeing you around the community and interacting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9727.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I know that while you're not sitting as a member,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9731.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you'll still be an active citizen and an active contributor to the young people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9736.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9737.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's all about now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9739.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Ann Marie, you are a person that I've come to know very, very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9744.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been very active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9745.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were involved with student sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9749.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were involved with student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9753.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little went on that Ann Marie didn't get involved in, school councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9759.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were one of the great joiners of all time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9761.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was something to belong to, Ann Marie was one of the members who was joining on to that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9769.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You rose up through the ranks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9770.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You became involved in the state association and rising to the rank of president of MASC, which gave you incredible perspective and you brought back a lot of very good ideas and brought back an awful lot of very, very good thoughts to help the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9787.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9788.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can always count on you to listen and to understand some of the perspectives we may have, even if you couldn't vote on a particular issue the way I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9796.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But still, you understood it, and you provided good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9802.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're an individual that I will clearly miss, along with Bob, as I feel like you've really contributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9809.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that your involvement at the state level will continue to be an important factor as we go forward in public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9818.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank you both because it's been a great ride with both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9823.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I reflect on all the things that I've succumbed to see, I know that the two of you are among the best school committee members that I've served with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9831.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9833.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=599.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I emailed the superintendent in Beverly with the details that I felt were pertinent to the matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=606.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you a quick update the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=608.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm waiting to hear back from him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=610.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did speak with him, and I feel like something will be forthcoming from Beverly very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1093.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like me to do that instead of speaking to yourself right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1097.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1101.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This evening, I passed out an update based on our discussions about what might be possible in order to provide additional assistance to students at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1113.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packets, you have a much more comprehensive discussion about additional measures that we're doing, but apropos to some suggestions made from the outside, including Mrs. René,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1127.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I put this memo together to give you a clarification, an update of what additional things we're going to do, and with your permission, I'll read it publicly so everyone can hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1137.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have a copy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1138.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1140.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As part of our plan to assist students at the Columbus with their mathematics preparation for MCAS 2.0, please note the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1149.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students in grades 3, 4, and 5 who require extra assistance to master the mathematics curriculum will be eligible to receive additional tutoring from paid Medford Public Schools teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1161.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students will receive between one and two hours per week based upon their need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1167.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what the student's need is and what kinds of recommendations their individual teachers make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1173.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hire six teachers for two hours each as tutors a week who will be paid by the Medford Public Schools from our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1181.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This program is planned for 16 weeks starting in January and the projected cost is an additional $6,200.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1188.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project that the cost of an extra afternoon bus at the Columbus will be paid approximately $150 a day for a total of $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1198.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working with our current provider, Easton Bus, to arrange a schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1202.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may have to find another provider since Easton's schedule is very tight and additional busing may not be possible through them, although we had discussions with them this afternoon and we think it is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1213.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since there are three buses leaving the Columbus each day with different routes, we will have to devise a route that serves the majority of students in the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1221.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then maybe you need to create a consolidated route.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1224.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, buses go in different directions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1227.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for us to create a consolidated route, there may have to be some different types of stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1232.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall cost of transportation, we believe, will be about $4,800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1239.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there are, well, the overall cost then is projected between tutorial and busing to be about $11,200 for the 16 weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1248.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple logistical issues to be worked out and there may need to be some modifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1253.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make those adjustments based upon multiple factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1257.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep the school committee informed as we progress with implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1260.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things like which teachers volunteer to teach, which days are most appropriate, which days the buses can go and what routes and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1269.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a number of things to be worked out in the interim, but this is the basic plan and hopefully that addresses your issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1314.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we're planning it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1339.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a variable we should look at, but I don't want to make any commitments till I see exactly how many students are riding the bus for this particular program, because I just don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1349.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be concentrated in a full bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1351.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be that we have a lot of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1353.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let us get into the weeds, and we'll see exactly what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1370.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll sit with the teachers and the principal to look at which students clearly need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1374.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student's doing exceptionally well, then chances are they don't want the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1378.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a student really needs it, we hope that they will want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1382.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't make anybody participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1384.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some people that maybe don't want to participate who could use the help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1410.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to begin with, let's target the students that we're looking at, and then we can open it up a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1416.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's see exactly what kind of response we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1419.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also got to make sure I've got six teachers that want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1423.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I feel they can actually do that particular work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1427.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a few things that variables, like I say, the logistics have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1432.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And until we actually talk to people specifically at the school and work out some of the details as to how many students would be on which days, there may be some students who want to come one day, some will want to come two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1444.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1476.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just suggest that, what do you call it, that the update, I can give you a briefer update through email or through some process, but it may take an extra little time to work out some of the logistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1486.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, next week is going to be a fairly, well this week rather, is going to be a fairly chopped up week with different things going on, and the logistics of getting commitments from people to do things may take a little bit of time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1507.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1573.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's our plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1725.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chair, since we're expending money, I think we should do a roll call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1755.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon Carolyn Joy, who's here, our Director of Mathematics, to come up and talk about the very generous gift, once again, from Dr. Martinez, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1943.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1956.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to make it clear to everyone that the work that the students are doing through the department is not only incredible, but I've been told that at least one of the robots they're creating is going to apply as an internal candidate for my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2010.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is something that's been in the works for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2014.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotta has continued to be involved as the director along with Michael Skorka as the coordinator and you have some materials in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2022.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm gonna let Mr. Trotta tell you about what's here and have some of the students and Mr. Skorka tell you a little bit more because I think this is a terrific project and it's got tremendous implications for the development of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2035.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: not only as academics, but as full-blown citizens in our community and in the world where I think that's a bigger need these days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2736.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, all these programs, we seek outside funding to support them long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2742.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, the funding came from Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2747.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cummings is the next round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2748.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a three-year grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2751.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be looking to get more money into this activity and expand it and develop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2757.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I might tell you, I think I mentioned it once before, that Mr. Cummings, William Cummings, is going to be a special speaker at graduation this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2766.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be having other outreaches to different people at different times, because obviously philanthropy is an important piece of what we do in order to keep some of these programs going and to develop them into model programs that can then receive even greater sources of funding long-term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2785.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the game plan, and obviously the great work, I think, you know, they'll tell you that they're finalists already in some outside programs, and they're already getting some great recognition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2796.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't spoil this at this particular thing, but I was told on Saturday night that another one of our programs is going to go national, so I'm excited about that, but you can't find out about it tonight because I can't tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2810.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the kinds of things we want to do, and as we do these things,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2814.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we attract sources of funding that are extraordinary and support our efforts to keep meaningful projects moving in addition to our regular academic and educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2858.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just need to develop it over time, you know what I mean, and develop other dimensions to it and create it in a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2865.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that's happening and something I'll tell you about at a subsequent meeting is the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2872.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is launching what they call Celebrating Massachusetts Leading the Nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2880.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we had a meeting with representatives from the department the other day, and the purpose of it was to identify projects in our school system and some other school systems that would demonstrate how Massachusetts leads the nation beyond testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2895.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously testing is something that we brag about as a nation, I mean as a school system, not a school system, as a state, as a commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2906.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are many other dimensions to education that Massachusetts leads the nation in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2912.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a good example of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2914.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some other really terrific examples, our family networks, other things like that, that are really unique and model programs that other people should be trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2924.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they fill the gaps that many communities don't have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2928.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is one of them, and this will also bring in resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2931.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is how you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4518.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we heard from the Massachusetts School Building Authority and the statement of interest that was put in place last year, last April, is not going forward in this round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4532.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I had a good long chat with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4536.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: executives in the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4539.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And without going through the whole report, a year ago 26 projects were approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4546.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year only 15 could be approved based on available funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4550.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we were strongly encouraged to go forward, to resubmit, to push the button, get it back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4556.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that a year from now we'll be in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4560.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be in the hunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4562.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's work to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4564.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We update a few more things than in the proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4566.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's going to go forward, and I think it's just a year delay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4571.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one of those things happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4573.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes the money coming from the pool is greater or smaller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4579.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just happened to be one of those years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4581.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from 26 to 15 projects, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4593.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hasn't been released yet, but when it's released we'll know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4597.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was told by the senior staff and their key people that the fact they came out and visited us on a full blown visit with architects and engineers, that we were very close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4616.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going for the core program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4618.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The core program is April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4620.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The accelerated repair, we already got money from boilers for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4623.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a much smaller and more targeted program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4627.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is much more expansive and has longer term values.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4634.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to come back to you for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4636.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just going to look over the application to see if there's any changes we want to make, if there are any things we want to emphasize or modify a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4644.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we go back to the council and ask them to certify as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4652.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4653.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that they obviously prioritize by need, but they also prioritize by money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4659.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have a project like ours, which could be a very expensive project, they have to be able to fit it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4669.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Staff report, please, on file.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4726.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are projects we'll go forward with, and there are projects that we should try to match up with MSBA because they're very expensive projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4734.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's plenty of projects we can go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4735.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be going to the council on technology in January and a couple of other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4740.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to keep moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4742.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just a question of trying to get somebody else's money to purchase our own resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4767.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so this is a report you've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4772.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee has a much more detailed report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4775.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't, as a rule, issue anything on security that could lead to someone<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4782.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, perhaps interfering with our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4785.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the cover report speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4787.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee, if you want to ask me specific questions at some point, please do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4792.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the general public, let's just simply say that we've spent approximately $200,000 on security camera upgrades and replacements at our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4801.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, especially external ones, are very fragile devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4805.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the years, they have been susceptible to adverse weather conditions, unpredictable power outages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4811.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The newer models are a little bit more resilient, but are not invincible, and they're not invulnerable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4816.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Placement of external calendars, cameras rather, on metal poles outside of the buildings tend to make them susceptible to lightning strikes, so we want to minimize that as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4827.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few cameras<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4828.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have no choice but to put them on metal walls because of the angle, but we try to minimize that and reduce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4834.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've contracted with American Alarm to upgrade and replace various cameras district-wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4839.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 154 cameras across the district in our nine schools, and believe at this time that we have sufficient coverage to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4849.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ensure security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4849.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, there's some cameras watching different things that aren't as essential as the main cameras that are watching entrances, exits, and main pathways in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4859.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, some of those are still a little bit more work to do, but you can see from the backup report that most of it's being done and will be done very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4868.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The maintenance of full security coverage will require that we annually budget<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4872.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: significant funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4873.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something that we can just look at every once every five years or four years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4878.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be approved to set aside funding and a special account to ensure that it will be used each year for upgrades and replacements, as well as other security equipment that's related to that, like the Raptor equipment and things like that, because those things wear out after a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4893.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's not used in any given year, we can roll it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4897.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and use it in the year that we absolutely need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4901.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security cameras, I need to emphasize, are only one element of our overall school security and safety response system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4907.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We continue to interact with public safety agencies and to practice special situation drills at all of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4916.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4917.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would ask if the committee wants to talk to me about any of it, you know, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4921.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd rather not be talking about anything specific about security that might lead someone to game the system at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4954.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras are two types.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4954.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that move and pan an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4957.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cameras that are fixed on an area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4959.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cameras that move are very expensive, but they're also more susceptible to needing more repair and upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4967.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have upgraded our cameras many times since they were first installed, since 2001 and 2003.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4974.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The system's changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4975.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They no longer run DVRs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4977.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're now more digital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4978.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things are different than when they originally were installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4983.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cabling has to be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4984.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to be locked into 911 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4987.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all these things require upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4989.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll continue to require upgrades as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4991.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got good coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=4995.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cameras cover the same area, but they cover it from a little different angle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5000.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as we talk and we set up a meeting, perhaps we can go into an executive session, allowable for security purposes, I'll give you more detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5010.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think at this particular point, we're in good shape, and I think we've moved forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5015.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate the fact that the mayor has authorized us to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5019.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the security cameras because this is a big expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5022.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to thank Christine because Christine did an awful lot of work putting it together with Alan Arena in my office to ensure that we did all the work that needed to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5065.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me provide you with an update rather than try to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5068.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a big discussion about doors because even though we lock doors, we have buzzer systems and the like, somebody from the inside could let somebody in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5077.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to make sure that people know that that's not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5101.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to set up, if I could, a special meeting for this purpose, because I don't want to talk about security in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5108.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think if we start talking about security, if we start opening up what is and what isn't, it's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5142.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we make it as soon as possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5145.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be the beginning of February.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5147.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get the work done and we want to get a lot of other things in place so we can be complete in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5183.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration to talk to you about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5187.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a requirement of the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6103.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important that you understand one fundamental point about all this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6109.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government gives us money to subsidize lunches for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6114.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If people are getting lunches who are not eligible because they haven't either done the work or haven't, you know, filled out their work or actually been declared eligible, the federal government looks at that as us taking their money to subsidize people who otherwise should be paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6133.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where the federal law comes into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6136.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're concerned, and by the way, there are communities in the Commonwealth that have run up balances of $50,000, $60,000, $70,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6141.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, was it Wellesley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6146.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Framingham, Wellesley, places like that really got slammed because people were taking lunches on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6152.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to have something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6154.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it has to be reasonable so we can be defended with the feds when they come in and do the audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6162.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reason behind it is when they give us a free lunch and they pay for it, they're saying that we want to pay the kid that's eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6170.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want to pay for somebody who's just never paying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6173.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way they look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6174.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to find some way to get something on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6177.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not tonight, we certainly have to do it early in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6181.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want us to come back with some, you know, something a little less, let's say, severe as far as you're looking at it, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6188.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to do something that's got to be on the books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6678.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Dr. Perrault is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6680.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you two reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6682.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is on the bus situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6684.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other is on vaping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6686.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we need major discussion tonight, but I want to give you an opportunity to get up-to-date on this, so you're aware of what's going on, and we can follow up and give you additional information as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6698.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Prowler has met with us today, and we've met with the bus company, we've met with the police, we've done a whole pile of things, and let Dr. Prowler explain the reports in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7196.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7198.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that a little, because we had an interesting discussion with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7203.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems that preferred seating is the back of the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7207.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they shoved to get to the back of the bus, because that's where they can have a little more mischief, perhaps in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7213.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say that benevolently, but I mean, they wanna get to the back of the bus, so they're trying to get preferred seating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7219.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally you like to sit up close and get off the bus faster, but that's not the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7223.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So obviously we have to have a meeting with the students, we have to make it very, very clear that behavior on this bus is really going to be monitored very closely, because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7235.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just can't put buses on just simply to, you know, get more of the same, because if they're going to push and shove on an uncrowded bus, they're going to push and shove on the next uncrowded bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7244.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to make sure that they understand that this is something, it's a privilege to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7248.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying very hard to give them the transportation they want, but they've got to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7253.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everyone has to own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7255.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also worked with the bus company, Christine worked with the bus company this afternoon, that if in fact we needed a backup bus on a given day because it was particularly cold or we anticipated bad weather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7266.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's say it was a snowstorm and we know that everyone's going to want to ride the bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7270.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we could get a backup bus in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7272.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then it costs us to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7274.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we wanna do these things, we wanna have contingency plans in place, but we need the students to cooperate with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7281.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the headmaster points out, we're gonna have a meeting with them, we're gonna make it very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7284.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you do things you're not supposed to do, you're not gonna ride that bus, we're gonna take you off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7289.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's a situation for us is that people like to go with their friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7295.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't be in a situation where people who don't need the ride home get on the same bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7301.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just is not workable for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7303.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a major expense with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7305.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Especially now, we're talking about adding a bus to the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7309.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about other kinds of costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7310.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had to add a bus to move some ELL students to the Brooks this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7315.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation costs are not inexpensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7318.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They cost $375 a day for a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7322.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: times 180 days, that's a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7326.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to provide services, we expect people to be respectful and we expect them to work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7332.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've gotta keep working at it, no question about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7335.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the injury is obviously tragic and unfortunate and we've been in contact with the family and we'll continue to be supportive to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7343.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But everyone's gotta own the solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7345.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just can't be, you know, whatever you do will be okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7574.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7575.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank Justin for the first time in my career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8429.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8430.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that, you know, Dr. Burrell was expressing extremely well is that this is a community thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8436.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Parents, everyone has to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8438.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you put enforcement in one place, they'll go to another place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8442.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just move the location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8444.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to change the outlook on the dangers about it and why it's not a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8450.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to work with the merchants, perhaps even to possibly put a city ordinance in to ban the sale of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8456.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it may be something that we can look at and possibly work with neighboring communities to get a regional ban in the area, so it makes it that much more difficult to acquire the materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8467.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a comprehensive issue, but it's not going to be done by just having a person chase somebody down the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8474.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8476.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: nice for a particular situation, but not as a solution to the larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8482.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8486.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just, you know, hopeful that maybe it's banned in general, because I don't think it's good for adults either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8491.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If adults have it, they give it to the kids at home, just like a beer, you know, your home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8497.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's have a beer or watch a football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8499.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do this, let's do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8500.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a sense that if a parent's doing it, it's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8505.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gotta get that message across.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8901.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a number of presentations here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8904.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to make each of them, and it's our custom to give everybody a chance to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8912.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8916.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let everybody say something and then make the presentations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8918.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably a good way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9579.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9584.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So having been around a long time, having seen an awful lot of things, and having interacted with both of you in different ways and at different times, I have some perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9596.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll start with Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9599.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bob, you've been a coach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9601.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9603.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been active in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9604.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've come from a family with tremendous tradition in public service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9610.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An uncle who was a mayor of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9613.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You had a relative who was an uncle, I guess, who was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9621.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been on this committee through different periods of time when different activities were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9627.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You experienced the sting of Proposition 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9631.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what it's like to be a teacher who got displaced, so you had always empathy for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9637.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you worked for the state auditor, and you had a really good investigative mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9642.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you play Columbo and Mickey the Dunce, we know that you really know what's going on, even though you don't let on that you really know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9650.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes, you know, it's kind of interesting to see how you play that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9655.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who knows Bob Scurry knows that Bobby really cares about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9660.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He does a lot of things that he doesn't take credit for, just quiet on the side, takes care of a kid here, takes care of a family there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9667.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he just doesn't talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9669.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I know about it because I hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9672.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that that really reflects on your good heart and your caring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9677.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And even though sometimes it looks like you've got that bravado coming on, you're really a soft puppy and you really care about people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9685.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're really one of these guys that you can always count on for loyalty and knowing what's going on without making a big deal out of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9693.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were the secretary for the committee for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9695.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You went over all the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9697.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very little got by you, if anything got by you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9701.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and you sometimes give me a wink and say, what is this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9704.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I try to dance a little bit, and you give me a wink.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9707.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you say, don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9709.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I remember all those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9711.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of history, Bob.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9713.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We go back a long way, and I look forward to seeing you around the community and interacting with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9718.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I know that while you're not sitting as a member, you'll still be an active citizen and an active contributor to the young people of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9726.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what it's all about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9728.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's all about, pal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9730.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Ann Marie, you are a person that I've come to know very, very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9735.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been very active, you were involved with student sports, you were involved with student activities, very little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9745.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: went on that Ann Marie didn't get involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9748.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School councils, you were one of the great joiners of all time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9752.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was something to belong to, Ann Marie was one of the members who was joining on to that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9760.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You rose up through the ranks, you became involved in the state association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9764.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the rank of president of MASC, which gave you incredible perspective, and you brought back a lot of very good ideas, and brought back an awful lot of very, very good thoughts to help the school system move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9778.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been a good friend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9778.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can always count on you to listen and to understand some of the perspectives we may have, even if you couldn't vote on a particular issue the way I wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9787.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But still, you understood it, and you provided good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9793.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're an individual that I will clearly miss along with Bob, you know what I mean, as I feel like you've really contributed and I believe that your involvement at the state level will continue to be an important factor as we go forward in public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9809.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank you both because it's been a great ride with both of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9814.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I reflect on all the things that I've come to see, I know that the two of you are among the best school committee members that I've served with, so I want to thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9824.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9824.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8064.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I have had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8069.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8074.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8075.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8079.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8086.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8094.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8099.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8100.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8108.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8110.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8116.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8121.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8128.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8134.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8146.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8152.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8153.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8154.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8156.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8158.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8161.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8170.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8172.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8187.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8200.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8202.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8208.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8212.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8224.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8228.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8235.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8242.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's uh, you know an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8251.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked uh, Stephen Hershey who's the again superintendent of Beverly um, because mississippianities was contacting the Beverly school committee and others up in Beverly and uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8265.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are siding with the Beverly public schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8268.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I you know, I need a lot more Feeling as to what's really took place point of information man The superintendent has the game officials committee been contacted to find out who the referee was and I asked I asked for that information I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8286.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8288.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8290.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8299.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8308.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8313.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8334.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8335.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't do a film in the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8336.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: game and they may have filmed the varsity game but I don't think from the J.V.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8339.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8371.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me let me if I can mirror let me let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey Because I'm putting on my cell phone and they'll give you an idea of you know, the strength of his comment It wasn't like I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8385.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very very, you know direct So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8573.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8583.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8585.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8587.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8591.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8595.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8599.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8604.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8609.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8613.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8619.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8620.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8621.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8624.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8626.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8631.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8645.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8654.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8655.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8660.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8661.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8662.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8812.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8837.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was prepared, that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=8999.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9015.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor too in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9017.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, the more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive, you know, and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9254.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9256.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9257.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9262.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9267.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9275.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9281.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but then we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9287.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9292.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced who don't pay a user fee for athletics would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9299.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9300.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9307.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=11990.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative and you know but as we move forward we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12939.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12943.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12955.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12957.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12961.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12963.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just want to let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13804.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13809.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13823.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13825.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13833.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13836.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13841.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13847.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13853.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13887.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13890.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13895.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13897.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13904.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13912.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13917.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13933.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=13941.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14037.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14043.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14052.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14073.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14083.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14112.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14124.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14139.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14147.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14151.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge, cognitive language, is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14169.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14174.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14176.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14184.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14185.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14190.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14196.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are going to look at the blend of programs and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14212.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14216.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: been working to get SCI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14229.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14235.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: receive students who have this English language need to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14244.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14250.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14253.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14254.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14256.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because as you move people around, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14260.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14273.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14280.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you'd come on up and give us a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14285.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14688.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14691.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14693.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14700.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14708.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14712.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14787.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14794.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL endorsement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14803.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=14824.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to Bernadette Bernadette to director of curriculum to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15241.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15556.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15557.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15560.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15585.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15590.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15594.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15600.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms of the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15618.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=15620.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16210.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16217.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16227.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16229.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16236.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16244.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=16248.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's a typical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=470.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=475.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=480.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=481.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=485.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=492.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=500.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=505.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=506.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=514.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=522.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now, and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=527.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student, but not necessarily the trainer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=534.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=540.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student, and also that the trainer was not licensed, and they gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=558.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, this is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=560.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=563.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=564.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=567.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=576.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=593.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to the Beverly Public Schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=597.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=601.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that for some reason, the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=608.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=614.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game too if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=618.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=630.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=634.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, you know, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=641.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=648.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if well, that's that's you know, an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=657.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, we have a back and forth going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=660.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the again, superintendent of Beverly, because Mississippi nineties was contacting the Beverly School Committee, and others up in Beverly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=670.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=671.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=674.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I need a lot more feeling as to what's really took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=678.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=686.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=692.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=694.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm gonna get a follow-up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=696.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=705.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=714.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=719.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=740.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt they were filming the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=742.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=783.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because I'm gonna put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of the strength of his comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=789.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=791.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was very, very direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=794.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=979.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=989.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=991.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=993.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=997.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1001.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1005.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1010.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1015.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1019.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1024.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1026.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1027.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1030.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1033.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't draw a conclusion without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1037.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1039.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a little bit more to follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1041.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1051.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1060.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1061.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1066.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1217.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1218.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1243.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1410.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1421.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1423.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1428.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1660.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1662.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1663.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1668.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1673.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers, because they're much higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1677.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1687.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that we'd like to increase, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1693.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1698.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4396.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4401.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5349.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5361.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5363.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5366.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=5369.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6210.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6215.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that every year, we're going to have to allocate money for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6219.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6225.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can go all year long and then find that we need cameras that have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6232.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6239.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6242.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6245.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6247.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered, so rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6257.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6292.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6296.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6300.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6303.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes, but given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6309.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6318.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6319.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6323.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6339.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6441.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6449.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6458.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that will come forward as a major proposal and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6488.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6518.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6530.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed a initiative petition, which he previously had some success in Arizona and California,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6540.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6544.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was given great support from John Silbert at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6552.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6557.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6558.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we believe they should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6563.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that require deep cognitive knowledge or cognitive language, is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6574.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6580.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6582.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them, and we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6591.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6596.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I doubt there's going to be much done in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6601.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are going to look at the blend of programs, and Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6618.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, as you probably know, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6622.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now, for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6635.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need, to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6650.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6656.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6658.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6660.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6666.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what options are available to you and what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6679.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But tonight, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and some of the other things that Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6685.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and give us a discussion on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7094.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7097.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7098.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7106.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7113.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7119.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7192.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7193.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7199.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7200.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEI enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7208.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7229.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we've responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7961.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's gonna hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7963.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7965.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7966.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7990.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're gonna have some field trips that are gonna show up in the next little while, and if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8000.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8006.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8025.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8616.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate because what happens is the circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8622.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8633.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8635.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8641.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, do I dare remind you that just last week we were approving a field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8650.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8653.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=479.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so I've had substantial contact with the Beverly Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=484.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They strongly dispute the account provided to us by Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=489.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simonides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=490.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've gone back and forth with Stephen Hershey, who is the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=494.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He claims, and he gave me the name of the trainer, the certified trainer, who was on the field at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=501.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He said that no trainer from Beverly did anything with the individual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=509.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, he feels that it may have been somebody else who just simply helped out on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=514.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I have a lot more to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=515.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did contact the MIAA briefly and told them that we're in the process of continuing to investigate what actually took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=523.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a distinct<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=525.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: difference of opinion between what Beverly feels happened and what was reported to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=531.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit going on right now and I'll have more reports soon as I get a better chance to talk to all the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=536.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The feeling from Beverly was that somebody assisted the student but not necessarily the trainer and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=543.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the play was allowed to go forward without any reason to stop the play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=549.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's back and forth, but Beverly strongly refutes the idea that their trainer assisted our student and also that the trainer was not licensed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=561.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They gave me the name and showed me the licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=566.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=568.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still going back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=569.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, the latest communication was as late as today from Stephen Hershey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=573.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've got a lot more work to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=576.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, there's a real difference of opinion in what took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=585.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I actually have it on my phone, and I can give it to you afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=602.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to Beverly, uh, the Beverly Public Schools, since the referee didn't stop the play, obviously he didn't consider it serious enough and that for some reason, um, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=615.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the assistance was done on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=617.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They suspect that somebody who maybe had a nursing background or something else like that may have helped on the sidelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=623.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, why did the youngster go back in the game, too, if he had a kick in the head?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=626.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a couple of questions that still have to be answered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=639.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, according to them, they didn't believe the referee needed to stop the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=643.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And secondly, and without casting any aspersions on anyone, as you know, Mississimini's was not at the game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=650.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so as a result, we have a situation where people who were at the game have very different reports as to what took place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=657.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but certainly blood is blood and if... Well, that's an assumption that was made as to when the bleeding took place and who did what and where and I need more information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=666.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously we have a back and forth going on and I asked Stephen Hershey, who's the, again, superintendent of Beverly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=673.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because Mississippi was contacting the Beverly School Committee and others up in Beverly and they are siding with the Beverly Public Schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=683.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I need a lot more feeling as to what really took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=687.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=694.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked for that information, I haven't got it back yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=701.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't speak to the coach, but Mr. Maloney did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=703.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to get a follow-up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=705.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, today's information, which I just got today, is a direct refutation of the story we got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=714.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I really need to ask a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=723.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't know when it happened, how it happened, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=728.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have two very different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=749.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt they were filming the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=751.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may have filmed the varsity game, but I doubt they filmed the JV game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=785.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me, if I can, Mayor, let me read you the latest communication from Stephen Hershey, because I'm going to put it on my cell phone, and it'll give you an idea of, you know, the strength of his comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=798.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't like, I don't think anything happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=800.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was very, very, you know, direct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=803.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me read it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=988.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to draw any conclusions until I have more investigation, but let me read you what Stephen Hershey wrote me today, and then attach some additional information which I'm exploring with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=998.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sending you copies of what I have in addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1000.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your athletic director sent a letter to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1002.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke with several Beverly parents I know usually attend the games.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1006.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While some of them remember the play, they do not report it as a significant injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1010.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They note that there was no stoppage of play, nor the issuance of a card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1014.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our trainer's name is Charla Berenas, and she has been with us for a long time without complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1019.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly has taken this seriously from the start, but I have been unable to verify what has been reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1024.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our coaches and trainer are expected to deal with potential concussions with great caution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1028.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We perform ongoing training to ensure we are attending to the safety of all athletes under our own<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1033.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our players from other teams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1035.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to find out what happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1036.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please forward me any information you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1039.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have an ongoing investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1041.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I can't draw a conclusion, you know, without more discussion with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1046.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came through today, and we've got a little bit more to follow up, and I just don't want to draw conclusions until I'm comfortable that everyone has a chance to review the information back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1060.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1068.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1069.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1070.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can add me to the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1075.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I was present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1076.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1225.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1227.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be in the conference room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1252.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been handed a report tonight that was sent to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1414.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1419.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1430.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's probably another factor, too, in terms of busing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1432.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The more busing that takes place, the less likely they are to arrive and take it before the actual school starts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1669.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just make one clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1671.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the breakfast program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1672.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not the total numbers of students on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1676.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1677.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, not everybody comes in early enough for breakfast, especially at the high school and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1682.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll give you a report with the total numbers because they're much higher when you look at the school lunch program as opposed to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1690.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: breakfast program, which is a more, let's say, niche program that not everybody participates in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1695.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one that, you know, we'd like to increase, but, and we've talked to Andrea Silbert over at EOS, you know, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1702.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that the breakfast program doesn't give you a full, accurate picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1707.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If just at the high school alone, the number of youngsters who are in free and reduced, who don't pay a user fee for athletics, would tell you that it's much higher than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1714.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1715.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we'll give you that report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1722.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4405.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're using the tobacco policy because vaping is sort of a derivative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4410.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we move forward, we'll obviously specify a little bit more completely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5354.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Move approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5358.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can just make one quick comment, as we've done this at this place every year for a long time now, and the reason we need to approve it so early is that if we have snow days,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5370.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, we've locked in the date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5371.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we don't have to have, you know, so many days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5375.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there are no snow days, we don't have to worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5378.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing, the other thing that I just will let you know is that Mr. William Cummings of the Cummings Foundation will speak at graduation in addition to the normal speakers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6219.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that it's really important to understand that cameras are fragile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6224.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that every year we're going to have to allocate money for this because lightning strikes, all kinds of things take place that are beyond our control and we can go all year long and then find that we need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6237.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cameras have to be replaced going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6240.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the key thing, you know, apropos to your question is, is that are we covering the areas that people need to be, have covered, that people can see?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6248.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The answer is yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6251.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll try to, you know, continually prioritize as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6256.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a camera goes down, we certainly want to ensure that a key area is covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6261.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than one that might be a duplicate of an existing area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6268.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most part, in the middle of December, we believe everything will be fixed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6301.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer that before we go too far down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6305.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. O'Keefe did provide a substantial number, 30 additional cameras this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6309.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them are not compatible with what we need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6312.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them can be used for limited purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6314.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But given what we're doing right now and given the upgrade in technology,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6318.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, what's coming out of that institution that Bill gets it from, uh, is not necessarily compatible with what we've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6327.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a few that can be, so we've got to screen them out, but we really can't be overly dependent on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6332.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate what Bill's done, but on the other hand, we've got to be careful that, uh, they're mostly inside cameras, and the things that deal with outside cameras are very different, and we're also dealing with a different way of, uh, of a transmission, uh, than we previously did, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6348.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can use them periodically, but it's not a one-to-one kind of application, but we do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6356.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we did once, but I'll send it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6450.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have expectations of coming forward with a proposal as the year progresses to enhance our human resources capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6458.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's become a major, major area, and you cannot continue to just simply treat it as a, you know, byproduct of everything else going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6467.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that will come forward as a major proposal, and we'll have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I doubt you're going to forget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6517.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Kirsten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6527.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, as you probably know, the state legislature has approved an option for school districts to incorporate bilingual education into the existing SEI format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6539.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, 15 years ago, Ron Unz, who came from California, pushed an initiative petition, which previously had some success in Arizona and California, and Massachusetts decided that it would adopt it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6554.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, it was given great support from John Silber at the time, and also Mitt Romney, who was a gubernatorial candidate, and it carried its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6561.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, since the time it's been implemented, there's been mixed results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6565.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but it comes with that whole idea that, you know, everyone should speak English, and we, we believe they should, but how to learn to speak English, especially to learn subjects that have required deep cognitive knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6579.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cognitive language is not so easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6583.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are reasons for blending and doing things a little bit differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6589.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously are looking at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6591.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be waiting for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to give us the latest guidelines as they see them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6599.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we haven't seen them yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6600.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We probably won't see them until either late spring or perhaps even into the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6605.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I doubt there's going to be much done in the next<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6608.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6609.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, we are going to look at the blend of programs, and that Paul is going to come up in a minute and talk about that, and how it comes together so that we can take advantage of the law where it's appropriate, while at the same time not lose track of, uh, situations which are best served by the current SEI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6626.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, also, as you probably know, uh, our teachers have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6631.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been working to get SEI endorsements, which are required now for teachers who work with students who have EL requirements, and the vast majority of faculty members do, especially in the core academic areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6644.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there's still some gaps, and there's still a need to continue pushing that as people receive students who have this English language need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6654.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to make sure that the teachers are fully prepared for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6659.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have the issue of dealing with the distribution of students with EL, and we're going to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6665.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did some distribution this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6667.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have some comment about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6669.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an easy subject, because as you move people around, you create, you solve one problem, you create another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6675.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to provide some options for you in the, um, beginning of the year, sometime in January, so you can look at what, what options are available to you and, uh, what it means financially and what it means programmatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6688.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, but tonight, uh, we want to give you an idea about the law, the pros, the cons of it, and, uh, some of the other things that, uh, Paul has put together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6694.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with permission, Paul, if you come on up and, uh, give us a, uh, a discussion on, on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7103.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be tied into our discussion about options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7106.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7107.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a larger picture and, you know, Paul and I have had some serious discussions about the pros and cons of any kind of movement of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7115.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it means for staff, what it means for transportation, what it means for siblings, what it means for, you know, language groupings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7122.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very complex issue, and it requires a great deal of trade-off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7127.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to decide what's the most important thing to us, what are the most important issues to us, and how we're going to solve them, because there's no one perfect solution for any of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7201.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7202.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time it should be noted that the courses were offered free, but that gate is now closed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7209.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So now we have to, if we have openings for new people, if they're not coming out of colleges with the SEL enforcement, we have to actually offer it if they have students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7238.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to ask our deputy superintendent to tell us how we responded to some of the issues that were raised recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7655.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may be tough because sound payments are generally made well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7970.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's going to hold anything up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7972.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know the basic premise of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7974.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7975.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think if we allow us to just move forward, you know, and the formalization will take place when we come back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7999.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess, you know, we're going to have some field trips that are going to show up, you know, in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8004.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little bit longer to get everything clear, we'll be operating under some old rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8009.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It might be useful to just simply say that in the main, this is an acceptable piece, understanding the amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8015.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, and that we provide the forms at the earliest possible time in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8032.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Forms, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8034.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll provide them to you, but at least you'll have something that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8625.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you need to be careful not to overregulate, because what happens is that circumstances change, situations change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8631.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're really saying to us, be responsible, be reasonable, keep us informed, make things, you know, don't let people go run amok and go too far down the road before, you know, you know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8642.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's really what we're basically saying to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8644.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think, you know, we've got professionals on staff, they've got to understand that that means give us the information in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8659.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also had a full month where we didn't hold a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8662.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really, you know, that was really a circumstantial thing, but that's eight years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=262.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, as you know, project 351 was started by Governor Patrick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=276.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was an attempt to provide leaders who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=281.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: come from our middle schools, and they would do community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=284.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we've done this for a number of years, and this evening, we have two representatives, one from the McGlynn and one from the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=293.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And right now, we'll call upon our principal, Paul DeLeva, to introduce the person from the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=782.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the School Committee, I'm going to call upon Tony Vento, our Health Supervisor, to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=789.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Kristen Goodell has taken a position at Boston University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=793.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as a dean, and she's done a great job for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=796.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Dr. Sabia is going to do a great job for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=799.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We met the other day, and we're really excited to have him on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=802.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm going to let Tony introduce him and let Dr. Sabia make a few remarks and answer any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=971.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this particular report is letting you know that the federal government has now approved our E-rate tier 2 funding, which is a substantial amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=981.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It needs to be matched.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=983.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's approved here this evening that will go forward, I'll go to the City Council at a future date to ask for the matching funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=989.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will allow us to expand our infrastructure to support our networks, to increase our switches and all the other aspects of the infrastructure that supports technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1000.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirstine Patterson is a lead person locally on this and she's going to tell you a little bit more about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1226.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1229.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1232.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I worked it out the date with the mayor and based on what's on their calendar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1263.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year we have a Veterans Day program, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli is the coordinator, and she's going to come up and tell you about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1709.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Mayor and members of the school committee, tonight we're going to prove there is such a thing as a free lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1713.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Kirsten is going to cover that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1857.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's going to the deck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1867.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it'll be stocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1869.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1870.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The donation of the deck appears to be what's ticketed for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1878.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: December 4th is the opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1881.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1917.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a couple of foreign language approvals in front of us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1921.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about them at our committee of the hall, so Rita is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1925.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, let me congratulate Rita publicly for her award from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1930.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the Italian Association for her outstanding work as an Italian teacher and administrator promoting programs in Italian culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1938.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1940.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1945.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other evening, Friday evening, at the Dry Dock, the Innovation Center, Rita was there receiving audits from a whole pile of people who were involved in Italian culture, including the Consul General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=1958.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Rita deserves all the work, all the credit that she gets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2474.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: State Leadership Conference in Marlborough, SkillsUSA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2478.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year is no exception and we're going to be sending a couple of teachers and four students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2484.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be paid for by grant money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2486.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be staying overnight so that they can participate in the full range of activities and we need the school committee to approve it so that we can take this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2495.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Trip on Schools USA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2511.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, it was unfortunately a situation where Mr. Fallon is new to our system and didn't realize it needed to come into us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2518.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We wanted to bring it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2519.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly in the future, we understand it needs to come to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=2580.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll call on our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3228.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, I think we all know that building maintenance, building condition, is a popular topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3237.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3242.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is the authority that's been put in place to assist with renovations, major renovations of schools, but they also try to keep track of where schools are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3252.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we all know where the pimples are and where the tiles are missing in any one school in our own world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3261.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when you look at the range of schools across the Commonwealth,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3265.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't do badly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3267.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the report I'm providing you is a report that it was done by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3271.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was done by a field visit to our schools by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3276.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they went to all the schools across the Commonwealth, virtually all of them, didn't get to everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3283.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they assessed and evaluated several key factors, including building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3293.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The study was conducted by architectural engineers, engineers in general, and who visited each specific building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3303.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, school buildings that were slated for MSB upgrades, already slated in the pipeline, weren't visited because they already had been out there and done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3310.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The buildings were rated on a four-point scale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3313.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the general condition and general learning environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3316.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A rating of one was the best, and a rating of four was the lowest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3321.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all buildings were rated for capacity utilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3324.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Underutilization was considered to be 80% or less, below 80% rather, and overutilization was above 125% of the capacity of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3337.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I provided you with selected pages of the MSBA report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3340.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was 96 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3341.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't think you wanted to read it all, but if you do, I can certainly provide it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3345.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I picked those pages I thought were relevant to us and would give us insights as to how they came up with these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3352.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you'll note if you go down to Medford schools and the building condition, all of our schools, with the exception of the high school and the vocational school, were rated one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3361.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the vocational school were rated two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3365.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But all our buildings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3367.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for general environment were rated one based on their study, not something we did for them, not something we told them to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3375.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They came out and rated it with their people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3378.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, building capacity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3382.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We fall into the average range in every building, while Brooks, Columbus, McGlynn, and Roberts are considered average, the Andrews a little bit under, McGlynn under, high school under, vocational under, and the Curtis Tufts under, in terms of capacity, in terms of room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3397.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now people talk to me about, is there capacity to absorb young people into our schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3402.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3403.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I've looked at this, I gave you a report not that long ago on the impact of development upon enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3409.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm working on a report that deals with some of the smaller buildings, which there aren't that many with young people in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3417.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, that is not changing anything as far as I can see so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3422.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's important when people ask us about our building conditions to recognize that we have had them looked at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3429.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's certainly room for improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3431.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one's going to say that we do everything the way it should be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3434.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we're not bad compared to buildings, school buildings around the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3445.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have put in an SOI to the state, statement of interest for the high school and the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3451.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect to hear before the first of the year whether or not we will be allowed to go to feasibility study.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3457.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe we're now in a pool of 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3460.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 88.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3460.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're now down to 44.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3463.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be less than that now since their last visit to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3467.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully we'll hear about that and we'll be able to move forward with a feasibility study looking at those two major buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3474.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3476.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3487.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they do have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3490.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're generally better than many others, but there are some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3493.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can get you that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3550.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they also want to, if they put an app in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3554.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they also want to make sure that buildings that are doing okay, stay okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3560.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are specific elements of our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3564.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like in our world, we want to work on the systems in the high school and the vocation school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3568.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to work on the shops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3570.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to work on other aspects of the facility that will enhance it over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3575.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember that building is, what, over 45 years old now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3580.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a solid building, it's not going away, but it can use some upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3584.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think these are the things that we want to push with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3588.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a very good meeting with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3590.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought when they left, they were very pleased with the kind of tour that we took with them and the information we gave them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3597.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's competitive, so we'll find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3604.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, they went around the whole place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3607.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They went around the whole place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3608.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now remember, we've got an oil project from them, we've got the science projects from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3613.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we've got some other things from them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3615.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it isn't like they've ignored us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3618.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, you know, the things we were talking about with them were, I think, well-received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3624.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3631.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, actually, I turned that around on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3633.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I said to them, see, your money really was put to good use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3635.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3638.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very good with your money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3639.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should give us more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3640.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3654.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they composited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3656.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report did not break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3660.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't break it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3661.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3663.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3734.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to announce it Monday night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3736.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to talk about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3742.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: M-A-S-C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3771.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in June 2016, the Medford school committee approved the succession plan for the position of superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3779.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have attached a copy of that plan to my remarks this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3783.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While it's within your discretion to keep, modify, and change the plan, it is a fundamental blueprint to begin the processes of succession and transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3793.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will continue on Monday evening with Glenn Kuchar, who is the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3802.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been my privilege and honor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3806.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to be an educator in Medford, in the Medford Public Schools, for 50 years, and to serve as superintendent of schools, your superintendent of schools, for 23 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3817.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've greatly benefited from the high quality and diligence of professionals, support staff, school committee members, and citizens who have worked with me throughout my career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3828.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I am internally grateful to them for making my tenure and responsibilities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3833.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as productive and as rewarding as reasonably possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3838.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been very fortunate to have seen former students become teachers, administrators, and staff in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3845.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've had the experience of enrolling children and grandchildren of former students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3852.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While no one does significant work alone, I've had the opportunity to build new schools, establish a full range of programs, acquire hundreds of millions of dollars in grants,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3863.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for our community and school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3866.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Understandably, there's room for improvement, but much has been done and more will be done in the months ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3875.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one gets to finish everything, but we have put a lot in place and that will be a solid foundation for the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3883.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Therefore, I am here informing the Medford School Committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3887.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that it's my intention to retire from the position of superintendent of schools, Medford Public Schools, at the completion of my contract on June 30th, 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3897.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This decision has been made without reference to any governmental change or any issues that are in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3907.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is simply the right period of time for me to spend more time with my family and to pursue special causes and interests<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3915.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that have not been possible given the schedule and work responsibilities of an active school superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3923.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is my intent and plan to be fully engaged in the months ahead as your superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3928.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a lot of positive opportunities, some of which we've talked about tonight, ahead of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3933.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will do everything possible to optimize and achieve our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3938.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, I will be committed to ensuring a smooth and effective transition to new senior leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=3944.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4118.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Pauline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4118.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4489.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4490.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4577.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4580.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an extraordinary paper about concussions that fall over, but it's not making much of a difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=137.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=139.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And since that time, grievances were filed and other processes, legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=145.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session, because I believe it affects our legal status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=151.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=382.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=383.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=706.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a report on the Nellie Mae Education Foundation Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=709.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who is a recipient of the O'Toole Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=716.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=719.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=721.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=722.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1589.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2296.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2299.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2303.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2309.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2311.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2316.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2320.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2322.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2325.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2330.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2337.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2347.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2350.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2670.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the program is a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2673.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2685.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting edge activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2688.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2693.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2696.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2698.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2703.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2706.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2712.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2722.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend, and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2742.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more to enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2752.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2753.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2850.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2854.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2867.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2869.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2870.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2951.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2955.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2963.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers, did a good job doing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2966.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2971.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2977.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2979.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning, and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2984.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions, as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2990.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers, and administrators, and professors, and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3007.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3008.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3022.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3023.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he'll come back, as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed, and how it can be advanced, and where we can grow from it, and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3034.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3040.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3042.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3050.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we bring back some ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3053.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3111.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Zizou actually participated in a teleconference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3116.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was earlier in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3118.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting at the international symposium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3192.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3201.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3208.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3209.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3217.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3227.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3231.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our students will be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3238.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3270.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick, one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3282.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released his transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3291.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3295.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3298.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3415.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5010.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5018.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5024.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years, but with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved and many more people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5035.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5037.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources to the school administration, the various shop instructors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5046.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories, include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5057.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5064.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5073.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5084.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're in violation, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5088.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5094.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5097.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5101.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5104.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5110.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5112.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5115.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5119.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5128.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5132.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5139.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5149.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5158.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5163.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5166.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5170.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them combine because of the affinity for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5173.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5176.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5182.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5202.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5203.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5212.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers, and we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5225.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Jill is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5241.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5243.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5563.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5565.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5796.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy, you want to comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=129.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=131.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since that time, grievances were filed, the processes, legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=136.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status, and I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=374.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=375.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=695.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educators Foundation grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=701.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O2 award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=708.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=710.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=712.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=714.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2287.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2291.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2294.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2300.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2307.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2311.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2313.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2317.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2322.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2329.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2338.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2342.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2663.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2665.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2677.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting-edge activity, and there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2685.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2687.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2689.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2698.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2704.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2714.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2723.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2733.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in Paris.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2745.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2841.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2846.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2861.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2861.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously, they're looking for educational leaders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2865.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2941.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2946.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2955.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2963.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2968.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2971.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2975.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2982.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=2998.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3000.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3013.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3026.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3031.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is, remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3034.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3042.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we, you know, bring back some ideas and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3103.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Zizzo actually participated in a teleconference that was earlier in the year, and his contributions were such that they felt that they needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3184.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3193.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3199.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3201.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3208.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3218.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3225.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3261.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3273.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3282.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3287.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3289.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=3406.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5001.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5010.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5016.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5019.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5029.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the various shop instructors, and they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5049.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5055.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5065.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5077.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5087.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5088.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5093.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5096.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5103.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5106.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5110.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5116.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: advisory committees to see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5120.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5124.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5131.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5141.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5154.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5158.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5162.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5167.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5194.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5196.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5204.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5207.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5217.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5229.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5232.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5233.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5235.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5554.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine can comment on that because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RdeZPdj6ap0&t=5557.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a quick idea and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=766.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that meeting, you made a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=768.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since that time, grievances were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=770.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The processes of legal matters were filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=773.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1011.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the opioid grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1012.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1331.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educating Foundation Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1337.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O'Toole Award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1345.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant award.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1347.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done a lot of very good things for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1349.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=1350.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2924.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the committee, this report is in two parts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2928.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2931.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2937.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2944.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2948.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were the first to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2950.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2954.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2958.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2965.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Rigodelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Kieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2975.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=2979.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3298.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, the program's a terrific program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3302.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3314.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is cutting edge activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3317.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3322.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3324.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3326.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3335.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3340.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3351.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3354.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend and we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3370.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3381.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3478.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3482.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tibbitt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3497.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3498.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, obviously they're looking for educational leaders to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3579.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3583.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3591.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3599.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we're the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3605.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were looking at us for ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3608.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3612.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3618.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3635.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and create some outcomes that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3636.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a selection of the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3650.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3663.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3668.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, it's only in its fourth year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3670.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you might imagine, with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3679.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we bring back some ideas, and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3741.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Participated in a teleconference Earlier in the year and his contributions were such that they felt that needed to be shared in a more let's say complete setting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3821.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3830.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3837.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was interesting, I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to students in Athens in Greek last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3845.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3855.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3862.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3898.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to tell you one quick story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3910.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3919.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3924.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it turned out that he got a D in French.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=3926.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=4043.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5638.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5647.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5653.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've existed over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5656.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5666.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the very shop instructors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5675.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5686.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5692.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5702.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5714.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5725.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5729.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5733.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5740.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5743.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5747.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5753.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: advisory committees so you see who's actually involved at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5756.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5760.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5768.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5778.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can be sure that our current administration of the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5791.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5795.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas, some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5804.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5831.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5833.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have students in their businesses right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5841.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5844.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5844.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly business activities, mostly with the laborers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5853.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5868.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could be outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5869.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be expansions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=5871.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very early in the year for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6190.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Christine can comment on that, because we've done some work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6193.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a quick idea, and then we'll give you a formal report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7DUlBp6f_Us&t=6195.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=34.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously lock in doors, put kids in places, put people in key strategic locations to watch doors and corridors and any other possible area where someone might get in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xIbdwu7VK3c&t=43.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone follow that exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2834.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2836.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellson, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2841.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2845.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2851.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been around for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2853.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Advisory committees have been part of Chapter 74 for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2858.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2859.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee knows about Chapter 74 Advisory Committees, and many of you have participated on it, including Councilor Penter at one time, and others have been on these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2869.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an unknown thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2871.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one error that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2873.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was made without thinking it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2876.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was simply that advisory committees meet and they go over the program that they were interested in, the Multimedia Center for Students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2884.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2892.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2897.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2907.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2913.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do, so it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2923.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it was and it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2930.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2933.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2940.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2945.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no attempt to block anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2947.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2955.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2960.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As to the Corey check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2967.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they're together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2968.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they do a program together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2969.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2972.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they do that, then it would be good for them to know that the people who are going to be doing it in this space are people that we have checked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2982.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think safety is always on our minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2984.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all agree on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2985.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2987.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If an individual feels that the Cori check has been unduly denied, they have the right to get it and appeal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=2994.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, do you think that any of us would ever be able to stand up in front of you and say that a person who had an insurance violation is a reason for denying them the right to come in here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3003.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if a person has been involved with molestation, or the person been involved with assault and battery, and a person's been involved with destruction of property, maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3013.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3015.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think it's unreasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3017.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's something that we should consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3019.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3020.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think as far as Chapter 74 goes, despite what the individual has to say, it was totally different than the community media thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3028.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really a part of us making sure that we're in compliance with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3032.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can stick with the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3034.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't happen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3035.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, we've posted all the meetings going forward to the advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3038.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every shop in the school has an advisory committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3041.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3043.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of you have participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3044.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate that because it's important for the young people to get expertise, not only from Medford, but from practitioners around the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3051.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate your listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3052.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3054.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3504.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I may, just for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3506.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have football games at Hormel Stadium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3509.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So everyone comes through the gate, should be quarry checked because they might sit next to a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3522.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3524.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hormel Stadium is the site of student activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3528.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have football kids there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3529.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have cheerleaders there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3531.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have other people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3532.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Public access, public areas are not subject to the CORI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3537.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it's direct, these key words, direct, unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3542.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I'm working with you, if I'm in the area where I'm working directly with you that's direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3549.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Indirect is not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3551.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People in areas you could be anywhere and have people who are near students and the like or near young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3558.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not the way the Corey statue has been interpreted and applied across the commonwealth, so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3566.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we could check everybody out everywhere they go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3568.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you go to the state house, you have to empty your pockets, you have to take off your belt, and you check everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3573.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can keep going and going and going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3576.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at some point in time, the terms are direct and unsupervised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3581.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, every public gathering where there are young people and families would require everyone to be quarry checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3587.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUlBWgAp9_8&t=3588.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just the way it's been interpreted across the Commonwealth, and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would comment on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2874.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, may I?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2876.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellson, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2882.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the Council, I just want to clarify a couple of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2886.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 is the Vocational Education Act that governs vocational education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2891.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been around for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2894.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Advisory committees have been part of Chapter 74 for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2898.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2899.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee knows about Chapter 74 advisory committees, and many of you have participated on it, including Councilor Penter at one time, and others have been on these advisory committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2910.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an unknown thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2911.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one error that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2913.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was made without thinking it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2916.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was simply that advisory committees meet and they go over the program that they were interested in, the Multimedia Center for Students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2924.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Their issue wasn't community access, their issue was the multimedia program for students, because it's required by Chapter 74.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2932.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 74 put out a manual and they increased the idea that the open meeting law should apply.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2937.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The director at that particular time didn't see that, didn't pay attention to it at that particular time, put it on the website for the school thing and didn't think it needed to be posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2947.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Typically a public body is a body that deliberates and then can make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2953.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as opposed to a public body or a body that simply advises an administrator who then advises a governing body like a school committee what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2962.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was an error.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2964.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2965.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it didn't necessarily affect anything to deal with community access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2970.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People ask the question, well, what does Ben Brown fit in this situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2973.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, Ben Brown, if he's going to manage this place, is going to interact with the teaching staff of the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2980.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So his name is going to come up, or his position will come up in that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2986.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no attempt to block anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2987.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we all recognize that this space is a good space, and we hope that it will be a terrific space for the community and a terrific space for the young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=2995.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the good news is that we can share it, and we can do a lot of good things together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3000.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As to the CORI check, what's to prohibit a program that's being jointly produced by young people along with community members?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3007.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they're together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3008.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if they do a program together?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iE4eK_fbeHg&t=3010.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's highly desirable that our young people do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=224.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations, a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two, the teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=239.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line and those line items is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=252.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=359.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and the check is made out to the conference Strictly for her, you know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL we now belong to the Northeast Conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=397.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=406.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=451.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=455.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=459.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=462.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=659.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=707.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=710.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=715.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=718.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=782.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would suggest that you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=789.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1387.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1392.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1394.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1396.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1398.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1401.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1410.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1413.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1416.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1427.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1443.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1445.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1449.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1454.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1462.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1471.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1478.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1484.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1489.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1501.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1503.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1507.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1511.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1513.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1515.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1516.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1517.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1520.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1529.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1532.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1536.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1543.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1553.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all, and that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1555.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1559.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1561.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1565.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1566.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1568.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1570.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1571.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1577.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1578.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=1580.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2353.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2356.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate, but I can't let one thing go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2363.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2370.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2376.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2381.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2383.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2385.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate, so ownership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2393.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2396.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2398.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2399.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2402.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2405.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2406.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2409.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2410.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2414.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2415.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, OK, you came out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2417.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2421.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2424.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2426.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2434.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2435.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2455.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't wanna go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2456.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2461.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2464.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2470.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=2481.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3234.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3238.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3251.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3273.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity, and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3289.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this program, Credit for Life, is one of the initiatives out of the state treasurer's office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so that we can have this Credit for Life Fair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3303.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity, so I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3667.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3679.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Report on game change anti-violence partnership grant from New England Patriots Foundation So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3695.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us who is our supervisor of health and physical education actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3701.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program as we all know that you know young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3712.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but they like to be associated with that and I think this is a really important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3716.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3717.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3727.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've gotta move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3729.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3731.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material, a trainer's guide, some selected portions of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3736.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean the whole thing would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3738.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3741.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports-related kind of terminology in it, so it's like talking trash scenario, you know, the kinds of things like that, or, you know, being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=3751.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people, and we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4678.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4681.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4683.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4688.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4694.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4716.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4725.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4736.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4744.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4754.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4766.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4773.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4776.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4786.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we had two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4793.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4795.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4803.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4806.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4812.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time It's only been built three times So I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4839.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4842.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4845.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4882.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4896.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4897.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4898.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4900.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4902.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of, and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4909.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency, and I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4923.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4928.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4934.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4936.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4937.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4943.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4945.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades, the Bruins bear, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4946.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat, the Patriot, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4948.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4950.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4955.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=4956.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5080.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5085.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5099.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross validate across the various reports and this also plays into the student reporting to homes and homes reporting back to faculty members and the like so it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5115.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5121.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5123.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5124.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5132.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5134.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5154.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5157.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5159.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5229.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5303.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5307.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5327.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5333.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over a thousand people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5337.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5347.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5349.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5351.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply is a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5355.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5357.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5359.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5364.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5367.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5372.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5384.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5389.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5390.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5394.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5399.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5485.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Tony is here and you know I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5491.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5492.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the globe about concussions and things like this and you know we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5502.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know we'll do this together and there's just a lot of factors about you see in the news today about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5510.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5513.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5517.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well, and it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5527.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5531.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5532.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports, and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5538.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5544.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that, you know, has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5551.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5553.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5555.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5557.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5560.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5562.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5569.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5574.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5577.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5581.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5585.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5590.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5592.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5595.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5602.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5606.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5615.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5624.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you might have, you're hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5629.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, a lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5634.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5636.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5641.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we track this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5643.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5645.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5794.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5800.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5803.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5816.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5821.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=5845.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6043.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6048.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6051.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6055.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6060.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6235.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6239.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6243.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are subpoenas out there for people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6245.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have sent evidence over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6246.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll let you know what's going on with that, despite the fact that some people think we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6253.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's done by the DA's office, not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6257.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, earlier this evening, a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6262.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6263.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6265.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6267.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to tell you about that because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6271.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Chapter 74 Vocational Advisory Committee on Multimedia met in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6279.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were never postings for those kinds of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6282.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6284.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6291.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6297.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it, but he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6309.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings, we've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6320.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6322.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also on the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6326.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6328.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6331.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6339.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6342.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6345.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6363.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6365.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6367.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6382.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6387.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are, the interpretation is there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6390.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6392.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6394.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6396.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6399.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6401.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6411.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6415.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are significant to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6426.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6464.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6484.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6497.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, you know, it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6499.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6501.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6512.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6517.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/7numIqSXrqc&t=6595.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=156.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirstine's not here, but I... Oh, maybe you can help me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=183.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=198.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=211.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=214.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=215.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=217.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=222.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=224.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=285.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is for the hockey clothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=313.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=319.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference, and the check is made out to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=326.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's strictly for her, you know, for the FIFA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=330.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of the GBL, we now belong to the Northeast Conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=356.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=364.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so let me look at what I've got.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=367.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=370.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=410.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=414.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=418.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=421.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=614.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting and get that straightened away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=619.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=663.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=666.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=671.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=674.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=738.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed, and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=745.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1341.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1347.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1349.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1350.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1353.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1355.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1364.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1367.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1370.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1381.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong, our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1397.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1399.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1403.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1408.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1411.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1417.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1418.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we did talk to union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1421.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1426.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1432.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1439.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1443.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1456.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement, that's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1462.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1466.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1468.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it, we'll come down, we'll have a nice meeting, we'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1474.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place including deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1484.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1486.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1490.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1497.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1507.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all and that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1509.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you, not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1516.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1519.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1521.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1522.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1524.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1526.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1532.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1533.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1534.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1535.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2305.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate, but I can't let one thing go I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2314.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2316.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know we met and we had discussions and we brought people in and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2321.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2327.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet and it could have brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2333.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2335.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2337.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is, what this is, is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2343.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So ownership, good results happen when everyone takes ownership of the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2348.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2349.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2350.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2354.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2357.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win, the school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2360.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2362.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2366.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2367.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2373.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2375.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2378.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2385.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2387.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2407.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2408.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the deputy superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2413.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2416.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2421.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2432.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3184.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3189.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report, I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3201.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3223.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3224.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity, and financial literacy is extremely important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3235.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3239.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this program, Credit for Life, is one of the initiatives out of the state treasurer's office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so that we can have this Credit for Life Fair<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3252.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3264.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccardelli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3617.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file, and we're going to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3634.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3640.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3645.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3651.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3653.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3661.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, I bet they like to be associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3664.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think this is a really important thing because it not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3667.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about, you know, how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3677.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3678.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3681.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material, a trainer's guide, some selected portions of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3685.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the whole thing would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3688.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3690.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports-related kind of terminology in it, so it's like talking trash scenario, you know, the kinds of things like that, or, you know, being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3701.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3704.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4625.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4628.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4629.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there, and we went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4635.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4641.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts, sometimes the preservation of small things that are out of school, that are historic, or from schools that are no longer there that might enhance the existing schools, or projects of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4655.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to remember, too, that this is not just a one-time thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4658.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4663.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4673.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also should be looking at, if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4683.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward on a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4691.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4702.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4714.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4720.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4723.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which is filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4733.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4741.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4743.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4750.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4754.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4760.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was rebuilt one more time, and it's now being rebuilt for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4764.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only been built three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4766.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I mean, it's kind of interesting to go back and see that Matthew Craddock never, ever came to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4771.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the bridge is named after Matthew Crack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4772.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4776.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office, there's a very interesting plaque there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4781.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It talks about Medford's history, the home of rum and crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4785.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4787.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4789.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll leave it to your imaginations as to what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4792.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know, the Medford Cracker was particular to Medford, but it had a split down the middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4799.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reason it's called the Cracker is when you broke it, it had a cracking sound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4804.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we're the home of crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4806.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes that shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4830.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4843.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4844.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4846.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4848.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4850.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of, and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4857.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4869.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4870.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4876.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4882.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4883.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4884.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4891.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4892.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades, the Bruins bear, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4894.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat, the Patriot, was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4895.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4897.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4902.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4904.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4998.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that people in tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5027.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5032.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5046.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5054.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5060.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5063.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with School Brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5068.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5070.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5072.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5079.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5081.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5101.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5101.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5104.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know, you won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5177.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5251.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5255.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5274.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5281.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5284.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5294.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5296.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5298.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5302.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5304.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5306.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5311.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5314.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5320.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5331.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5336.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5338.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5341.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, a piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5346.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5432.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does Perry love concussion law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5434.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony is here, and I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5439.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5440.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the Globe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5441.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fantastic, I got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5443.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About concussions and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5445.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a trainer, we have a doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5447.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although the doctor is leaving, we're going to have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5450.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up, Tony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5450.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5452.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's just a lot of factors about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5455.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see in the news today about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5457.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The trauma caused by brain injuries, the Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5464.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5469.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5474.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5480.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every year there are injuries in all the sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5482.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They range from broken bones to cuts and to other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5492.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5498.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5500.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5502.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5505.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5507.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5510.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, that often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5516.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5522.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5525.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5528.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5532.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5537.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5539.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5542.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5549.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: they're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5553.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5562.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5572.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5577.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5581.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5583.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5589.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We track this every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5590.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5592.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5729.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: EDUARDO By the way, over the three year period there were 58 different identifications of concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5739.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5748.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5750.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5764.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5767.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'd have to go through the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5768.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5792.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5793.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A better identification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5990.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing and getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5995.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5998.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: counseling in the nurse's office, talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well, because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6007.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6183.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6186.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6190.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over, and we'll let you know what's going on with that, despite the fact that some people think, you know, we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6200.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6201.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done by the DA's office, not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6204.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6205.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is, earlier this evening, a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6210.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6211.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6212.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6214.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The open meeting law, I'm going to tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6218.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Chapter 74 Vocational Advisory Committee on Multimedia met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6224.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the past, there were never, you know, postings for those kinds of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6229.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6231.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6239.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it was done very innocently by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6243.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by Heidi and her team, and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it, but he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6256.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings, we've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6267.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6270.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6273.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6275.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6278.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city of the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6287.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6290.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6292.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6310.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6312.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6315.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6328.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6329.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived at public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6334.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6339.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6341.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6343.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6346.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6348.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6359.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6360.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6362.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that slipped by the boards and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6411.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6431.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6435.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One's at 6, one's at 8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6446.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6448.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6453.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6459.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6464.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6543.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=187.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the teacher's contract, okay, we put in during the last negotiations a piece that allocated $30,000 in year one and $40,000 in year two for teachers to take individual courses and be reimbursed up to $1,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=202.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What you're seeing in that line, in those line items, is reimbursement for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=215.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They apply for it through the deputy superintendent's office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=218.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He reviews it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=219.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's first come, first serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=221.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously review it for graduate credit to make sure that it's consistent with educational purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=226.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We approve it on a first come, first serve basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=228.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they provide the credentials and the evidence that's been completed, we pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=317.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that is for our fee to the Northeast Conference, which we have now joined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=322.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual named is the coordinator for that conference and check is made out to the conference Okay, cuz yeah, it just strictly for her You know for the for the FIFA instead of the GBL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=335.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We now belongs to the Northeast conference<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=360.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you can tell me the item, I'm not sure what you're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=370.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a refurbishment of the field every work on the turf fields and that's for rubber refer re-infer refurbishment of that field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=415.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a committee of the whole on the vocational and high school merger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=418.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=422.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you choose to read it, usually it's read by the secretary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=425.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If not, you can just simply waive the reading and just simply accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=622.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll bring them down to the next meeting, and I'm sure it can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=671.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get a clarification out this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=673.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When I see Dr. Perrella tomorrow morning, we'll send you a notification as to what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=678.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it can be done the way you want it, we'll do it right away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=682.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's some other issue that has come up, they'll explain it and we'll deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=745.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you suggest that, what do you call it, you give us another month to do that because people are still being placed and this will be a very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=753.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transitory report this early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1350.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, teachers of the McGlynn, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1355.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the teachers of the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1358.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We respect the McGlynn school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1359.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have two very fine middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1362.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We never said that we didn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1364.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also said that there's a public perception out there that one school is more attractive than the other at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1373.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Several years ago, it was the other way around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1376.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school drew more students than the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1379.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, there was a significant imbalance in grade six coming up based on parent perception, based on what parents were telling us about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1390.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, whether they're right or they're wrong,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1393.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal was to restore that balance, and our goal was to bring everyone into the picture and create ownership so that we would all move forward and change that imbalance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1406.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not an indictment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1408.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an attempt to try and say, let's do something about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1412.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the action plan, our suggestions and things that we've put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1417.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, there were some moves that we made by reassignment, but that's the right of the administration through the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1425.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the right to reassign people, and we did talk to union representatives, and we did try to negotiate something, but it broke down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1435.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My point right now is that I welcome your interest in working with us going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1441.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I encourage it, because the only point we're trying to make right now is we have to own the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1447.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, public perception is one school is more attractive than the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1452.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal is to change that perception, to let them know how much you are doing for their children, to work on the distribution of population, and to try and move it forward in a very positive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1465.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome your involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1466.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we ask for in our discussions with union representatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1470.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the key points was everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1475.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: everyone would collaborate and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1477.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I welcome it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1478.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1479.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have a nice meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1480.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk about what we can do, what we can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1483.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things we're putting in place, including our deputy superintendent gave out to the committee some materials on clubs that have been expanded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1493.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, every budget has its limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1495.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't do everything that everyone wants in any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1499.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are expansions of clubs and activities which we think are extremely significant, and we're listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1506.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we ask is that we tackle it together so that as we go forward, when people are making choices next year about where they want to go to middle school, that it will balance out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1516.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1517.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we'll work forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1518.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there are other things that have to be done, we intend to do them with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1522.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not to you, with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1524.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everyone to accept that and work together with us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1528.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1529.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate you coming down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1531.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate your courage in speaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1533.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1534.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a good stimulus that you got up here tonight and you spoke and you said who you are and you're proud of who you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I applaud that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1541.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1543.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=1544.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2315.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent so I hear you adversity brings opportunity and we should collaborate But I can't let one thing go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2326.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet, you know we met, and we had discussions, and we brought people in, and we talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2333.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it didn't end up in a positive result the way you wanted it, but we did meet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2339.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we did meet, and it could have had brought some changes, but we couldn't reach an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2344.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm not blaming anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2347.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a blame game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2348.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What this is is an attempt to say the best result for all of us is to collaborate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2354.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So ownership, good results happen when everyone's ownership is resolved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2360.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're here to help you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2361.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2362.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't win as superintendent if one school's not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2366.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I only win when everyone's doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2368.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I want you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2370.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee wants you to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2372.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all want to do it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2373.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if this is a clarion call to do more, then let's do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2377.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2379.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a chance to say, okay, you came out, you showed a little spirit tonight, great spirit tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2384.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2387.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Justin spoke extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2389.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next step is collaborate, move forward, listen to any suggestions you have, and let's move forward in an intelligent way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2397.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And next year, who knows?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2399.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might be even over-enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2418.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2419.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that you had conversations with the Deputy Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2425.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About many of the items in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2428.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at any point, it serves no purpose to go back and forth tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2433.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue tonight is your voices are heard, you are respected, we want you to know that, and we want to work with you, and we look forward to doing that in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=2444.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you need to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3197.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee is Dr. Riccadeli here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3202.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before she actually delivers this report I want to say that today I spent a couple of hours with the Economic Empowerment Task Force of the Commonwealth<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3214.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: going over various initiatives that the state is putting in place that deal with helping families to save for college, to deal with financial literacy, to deal with debt, to deal with the kinds of things that are very, very significant to people in their lives in terms of being able to afford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3236.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to live in the commonwealth, and we are, you know, right in the middle of it because we are strong participants with that activity and financial literacy is extremely important to us, and we're going to continue to promote that in a very, very powerful way, so this program credit for life is one of the initiatives out of the state Treasurer's Office, and Dr. Riccadeli has been working with a small task force to get it ready so we can have this credit for life there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3266.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this January, and I can tell you that we are going to have an invite list of serious members from the state who want to be here for this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3277.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to let Dr. Riccadeli talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3630.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just receive and place on file and we're gonna move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3648.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is another very significant initiative that the school system is working through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3653.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3658.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rachel Perry with us, who is our supervisor of health and physical education, actively involved in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3664.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an exciting program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3666.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we all know that young people like sports and they like to be associated with sports heroes, despite yesterday's loss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3676.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they like to be associated with that, and I think this is a really important thing, because it not only does two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3680.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it talks about how to recognize a healthy relationship, but it also deals with gender issues, which I think are really significant in our world today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3690.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to move forward on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3692.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3694.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some additional material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3697.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A trainer's guide, some selected portions of the whole thing because it would be like 100 pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3701.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can see the kind of curriculum that's in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3704.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got a lot of sports related kind of terminology in it, so like talking trash scenario, the kinds of things like that, or being offside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3715.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the kind of thing that appeals to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=3717.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a whole team that's involved, but Rachel's going to explain it to you in detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4641.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, last week was it, Roberta?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4644.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roberta and I met, Diane was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4646.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over a number of things that, you know, might have value to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4651.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also talked about an ongoing process with our students in each of the schools coming up with ideas too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4657.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there are small projects and preservation of artifacts sometimes the preservation of small things that are at a school that historic from schools that are no longer there that might Enhance the existing schools or projects of that of that type We got to remember too that this is not just a one-time thing this is going to go on for a while because the CPA is a continuous source of funding and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4679.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it continues, there's some things that maybe we won't get in round one, but we should be planning for in rounds two and three, because it goes forward into the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4688.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we also should be looking at if we were able to come up with a project, is there a match that we can grab from the community, whether it's a bank or some other resource that we can entice if we got this money from community preservation, would you contribute this to support this project so we can move it forward at a larger scale?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4707.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's a great opportunity for students and faculty to participate in the identification of projects and in doing things that are meaningful to them in each of the various schools<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4717.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: throughout the community, and also possibly to create, and this is something we've talked about before, a museum of education that would preserve all the kinds of things that go back into Medford education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4729.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were able to give Roberta a copy of Michael Coates' book, which is filled, I don't know if you had a chance to look through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4739.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filled with all kinds of historical things that talk about the city, some of which relate to the schools and some of which are just simply very interesting about the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4749.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You probably don't know that we have two racetracks in South Medford, things of that type, but there's a lot of things in the city that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4756.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that are interesting and could be preserved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4758.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it helps our young people understand how a city evolves, how transportation evolved, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4766.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You see the bridge being built right near Medford Square right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4769.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That first bridge was built under the auspices of Matthew Craddock in 1634.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4775.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, and and it was rebuilt one more time and it's all being rebuilt for the third time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4780.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only been built three times So, I mean it's kind of interesting to go back and see the Matthew Craddock never ever came to Medford But the bridge is named after Matthew Craddock So there's a lot of very interesting things that we can do and on the last comment I'll make is if you stand outside the mayor's office is a very interesting plaque there it talks about Medford history the home of rum and crackers and I like the term crackers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4802.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It sort of reminds me of certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4805.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: leave it to your imaginations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4808.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you know the Medford cracker was particular to Medford but had a split down the middle and the reason it's called the cracker is when you broke it it had a cracking sound so we're the home of crackers and sometimes it shows up at meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4845.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report just gives you a quick synopsis of 54 vendors showed up at the mayor's and the schools and the athletic department and the city board of health's annual fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4859.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4860.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year was held in the lobby.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4861.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year was held in the gymnasium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4863.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 200 people attended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4866.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was tremendous resources there for people to take advantage of and it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4872.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you'll see in this agenda tonight is you'll see a lot of things that deal with health and wellness and just taking care of yourself and paying attention to your needs outside of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4884.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4886.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes when people try to talk about our schools, they talk about only in terms of academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4891.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the hallmarks of our schools is that we pay a lot of attention to a lot of other aspects of human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4897.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4899.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad to host it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4900.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that the mayor did a great job putting it together with various members of the city and the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4906.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4908.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Blades of Bruins Bear was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4909.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Pat the Patriot was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4911.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a picture with both of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4913.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going up on the wall tomorrow morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4918.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a great thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=4919.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good that we have so many different vendors in our city that care about health and care about the well-being of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5014.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that people at tonight's meeting or afternoon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5043.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any piece of software requires constant training and updating of our personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5048.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's complex, it's involved, but we're getting a lot of data into it to help us understand where our students are, where our teachers are, what the courses they're taking, and we have to report to the state and it has to cross-validate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5062.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about five or six reports we do, and each one has to be correct in order for them to cross-validate across the various reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5070.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this also plays into the student reporting to Holmes and Holmes reporting back to faculty members and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5076.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just gives you an idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5078.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is things we're doing with school brains and it's a work in progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5084.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can say that, why isn't it perfect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5086.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it takes time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5087.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a lot of work for people to understand how you input data, how you cross-validate data, how you use data more effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5095.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think I just wanted to give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5097.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know these things are hard to read, but it gives you an idea just how much our secretaries and our staff have to learn about how to use a complex piece of software so that we can get to that point in time where we can use data very, very effectively and be totally data informed about what's happening in our schools, what's happening in the community, and how it relates to our progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5117.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just wanted to give you an idea of what was involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5120.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5122.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You won't read every word of this in between, but you get an idea of what people have to go through in order to be effective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5193.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5266.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data is one aspect of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5270.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: human resources is a major field today and we have got to as a entity develop a human resources team because there's so many aspects to every aspect of an individual from licensure to professional preparation to ongoing preparation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5290.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other things they have to do, you know, FMLA, all the kinds of things that affect human development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5296.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have over 1,000 people that work for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5300.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, different aspects of what they do, are they properly trained for what they do, are they keeping up their licensure, all this stuff has to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5310.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we've got to get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5312.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At one time, none of this stuff had to be tracked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5314.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just simply, you're saying a person's got a teaching license, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5317.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, now we need all the kind of data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5320.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to look at things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5322.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to follow up things so that the people who are running the educational side of the operation concentrate on what they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5327.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not chasing down the human resource pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5330.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it may be a shift of some people as opposed to, you know, more people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5335.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it may be just trying to develop a pattern that we have a human resource field, a field that ties into data, a field that ties into education, a field that ties into operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5347.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that will go a long way to bringing us completely into the modern age.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5352.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just part of life today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5353.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most operations have human resource operations today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5357.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're doing it with our existing people, and piece here, piece there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5362.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's getting to the point where it's advantageous to look at it in a more, let's say, cohesive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5448.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, but Tony is here and you know, I want to talk a little bit about it to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5454.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a handout tonight, it's in the Globe, about concussions and things like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5461.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, we have a trainer, we have a doctor, although the doctor is leaving, we're gonna have a replacement doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5465.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Come on up Tony, you know, we'll do this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5468.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's just a lot of factors about, you see in the notes today about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5473.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the trauma caused by brain injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5476.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Aaron Hernandez case brought a lot to the forefront as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5480.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: BU has a major department on this topic as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5485.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's just important that we understand what our experience is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5490.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, sports, they played with passion, they played with great force, there's going to be injuries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5495.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there are injuries in all the sports and they range from broken bones to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5501.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: cuts into other kinds of bruises and strains and ankles and things like knees, ACLs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5507.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But concussion is something that has long-term impact, real long-term impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5514.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can get a repaired knee, things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5516.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be the best thing to get, but you can get one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5518.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have brain injury,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5520.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be something that you can recover from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5523.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are things that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5525.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting facts that I learned, and I think it's important to understand this, it often isn't just one hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5532.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the injuries come from the cumulative effect of multiple hits over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5537.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's really that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5540.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then that one hit maybe throws it over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5544.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's really generally a buildup, an accumulation of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5548.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I learned a little bit is that females have been more likely to get concussions than males.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5553.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would think, why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5555.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you think some of the male sports are more violent, seemingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5558.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But part of it is because of the neck structure of a female, the shoulders, things like that, or maybe the leg structures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5565.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not quite as pronounced and strong in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5569.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not always, but I mean there are some instances that there are issues like that that anatomically might lead to that kind of injury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5578.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5587.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, and you know in a game like soccer, you know, might have, hitting the ball,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5592.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of discussion about should you be wearing helmets, shouldn't you be wearing helmets?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5597.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of discussion that's going to come up, and I think it was useful for us to at least have it in front of you so that we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5604.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We track this every year, and I gave you three years of experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5608.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's important for us to understand what's going on and we move on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5747.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, over the three-year period, there were 58 different identifications of concussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5754.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: all the seasons, and well, you might expect football was the leading one, but soccer, hockey, right up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5763.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And believe it or not, cheerleading had eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5766.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it, you know, it sometimes surprises you where it can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5780.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked Tanya for that, but she didn't have it exactly that, but she'd have to go back and do the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5783.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She'd have to go through the records.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5784.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She just said it was slightly more female than male to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=5808.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6006.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing we should talk about is that it's not just playing getting back into sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6011.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster has a concussion,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6014.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Counseling and the nurse's office talk about accommodations made in the academic classroom as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6018.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the youngster might be dizzy and not able to complete their homework for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6023.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's communication on that level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6198.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to give you two pieces of update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6202.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Tarabelsi trial begins tomorrow in court and you know there are subpoenas out there for people we have sent evidence over and we'll let you know what's going on with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6211.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Despite the fact that some people think you know we don't prosecute things we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6216.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't, it's done by the DA's office not by us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6219.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6220.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is early this evening a gentleman, an individual, I'm not going to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Use that term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6225.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, be kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6226.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, I'm kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6228.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Referred to the open meeting law, I'm gonna tell you about that, because you'll hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6234.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The chapter 74 vocational advisory committee on multimedia met.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6240.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the past, there were never postings for those kinds of meetings, it's just one of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6247.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he pursued it, and quite frankly, the AG has ruled that that should be posted, so we're posting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6254.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it was done very innocently by Heidi and her team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6260.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and just simply bringing together people to talk about the studio, how the students would use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6265.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he's turned it into something that is more dark and insidious than it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6272.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we've done is we've put out, I'll give you a copy, we've put out a list of all those advisory committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6278.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've posted them, we'll continue to post them, and they'll be done and we'll meet that requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6283.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what was being referred to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6285.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also in the agenda of the city council last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6289.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6291.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if you hear about it, that's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6294.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although it's being played up to a very different level than really is the, there's no penalty to the city or the schools for that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6302.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mark Romley did a nice job in explaining it to the AG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6305.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're on from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6308.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6326.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't something that they ever did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6328.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean, it was just things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6330.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it only took on in life when it involved itself with the media and cable and things of that, it took on a life with this individual who, that doesn't mean we shouldn't post it, it just was something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6343.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, now we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6345.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These were the kinds of things that weren't perceived in public bodies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6350.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They sometimes are interpretations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6353.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6355.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: PTOs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6357.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't heard anything about PTOs yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6359.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of these things, you know, what is a public body?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6362.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean that's really the thing that has to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6364.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I heard through another missive that I received that the Attorney General Mara Healy is going to be putting out some additional guidelines on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6374.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on these things as well, so we'll see what that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6378.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we try and let everybody know about meetings that are of significance to them, but obviously that's one that's slipped by the boards, and I don't think it was intentional by any stretch of the imagination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6389.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: has been played into a different stratosphere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6427.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure over time we can but I'll tell you this is not a not a new topic Because there are so many meetings, you know schools have to meet they have to work them in Obviously, no one wants to meet on Friday nights very few people want to meet on Saturday or Sunday so I mean so you've really everything gets compressed and sometimes you just have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6447.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, go to, choose which meeting you're going to, or set them at different times, one's at six, one's at eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6461.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's hard, we're posted, but it's hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6464.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very, very hard to schedule all the things that people want to do, and there are plenty of people who don't go to multiples, they go to one thing, but there's always a few that cross over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6475.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a topic for years, and it's always come up short in trying to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6480.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know, obviously it would be good to communicate when things are close in nature, or there's a likelihood that the same people would be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WsdkVhZ-zp4&t=6559.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe by the next meeting, if someone can do it, we can designate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=493.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=494.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellison, superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=495.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=501.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=506.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=511.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we were able to maintain good class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=515.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=528.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=539.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=541.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no significant change in space availability and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=545.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had 3 in regular classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=556.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=565.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, overall, I think we're in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=569.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=584.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=590.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that may be required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=596.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes people come into the community with a tremendous need, and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=605.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=608.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's sort of like a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=609.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=625.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=635.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=640.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we moved the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=649.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=651.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=658.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=664.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's, you know, it's important that you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=667.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=684.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't know if it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=685.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue around the state or in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=704.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those are the big concerns and I think the development it can go hand in hand without impacting the schools But naturally we always pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=711.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=712.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=731.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 21.5 at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=737.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=738.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the McGlynn, if I look at the latest numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=740.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're looking at the actual number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=742.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, you're looking at the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's by choice of the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Principal might, from time to time, decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well, and there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=781.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=787.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one, can afford it, and two, that might have sufficient space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=793.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seemed to be they were looking for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=795.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=911.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=921.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that a contractual requirement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=922.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a contractual requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=923.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=931.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=941.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=944.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=953.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=967.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=971.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No paraprofessionals covering any classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=975.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=985.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=986.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just depends what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=987.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1005.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no limit to what it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1007.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a need and budget related thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1009.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, it really depends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1010.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, today, you know, we talked about a particular student who has real needs and we added one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1017.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1021.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1027.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we move somebody over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1028.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's always a juggle because obviously everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1152.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might see another 50 students in the schools across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1156.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at least the way it's normally the pattern is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1160.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We started before September, we got pre-Labor Day, and that has an impact on some families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1166.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families just want to take the extra days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1168.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people don't get wound until they actually hit September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1172.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that first week is sort of that thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1175.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1183.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's much lighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1189.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1192.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look on October 1st, that's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1200.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1203.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=633.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Name and address of the record, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=641.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=807.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=824.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't know if it's sustainable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=826.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety, or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=841.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: around the state or in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=843.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the big concerns, and I think the development can go hand in hand without impacting the schools, but naturally we always pay attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=852.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate you listening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=853.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=854.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=862.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's 23 there, but I'll take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=865.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think any class is that high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=878.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=880.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I look at the latest numbers, if you're looking at the actual number or you're looking at the numbers, that's by choice of the, of the principle principle might from time to time decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=894.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=921.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to-<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=928.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one can afford it, and two that might have sufficient space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=934.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems to be they're looking for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=936.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1052.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school, up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1063.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a contractual requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1064.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1072.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1082.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1085.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1094.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1107.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1111.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No paraprofessionals covering any classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1116.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1125.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pretty much, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1126.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just depends what they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1127.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1146.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no limit to what it's allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1147.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a need and budget-related thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1150.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it really depends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1151.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, today, we talked about a particular student who has real needs, and we added one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1157.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1162.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1168.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can we move somebody over?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1170.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's always a juggle, because obviously, everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1292.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might see another 50 students in the schools across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1297.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At least the way it's normally the pattern is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1300.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We started before September, pre-labor day, and that has an impact on some families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1306.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families just want to take the extra days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1309.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people don't get wound until they actually hit September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1313.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that first week is sort of that thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1316.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1324.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's much lighter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1329.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1333.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look on October 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1334.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1340.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/pq2sA59Wqso&t=1343.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6444.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6456.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16169.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm here, Mr. Vice President, as tonight's security, because you were concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16175.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, you're providing the security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16184.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16185.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's your answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16186.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16187.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do quarry checks on everyone who has unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16194.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's anyone who works here, a contractor, anyone who comes in like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16199.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there is a dedicated door that you can't go from the studio into the high school once it's fully operational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16209.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we're still using it with students so they can go during the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16214.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are any number of activities that students have that people coming up here in the afternoon might interact with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16221.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, you know, I think that the city, and you know, I don't have an objection to taking the extra step in making sure that anyone who might be up here frequently, who is moving around that area outside of the studio into the area, might find their way into the front door at a given time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16239.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we check it out a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16242.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as other groups go, we've rented properties for years, and we haven't required it because generally they're under the supervision of people, and the people there are on a volunteer basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16253.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really isn't exactly the same thing, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra measure of precaution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16293.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our students are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16294.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we had a coach, and they were coaching on the field, they'd be quarried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16298.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we have a rental out there, they're not our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16304.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16308.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the requirement of the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16312.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, but access to the building isn't the standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16315.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people who have access to the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16317.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A parent comes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16321.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: get checked in, but they're not quarried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16323.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So access to the building is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16325.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The standard for quarrying is unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16364.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, you can have a person walking on the street and have them contact with someone who's inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16371.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16373.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we have a rental, and we have a situation where people, let's say the Japanese language school, because that's the sanity reference you're making, they have their own students, they have their own people, they have their own coverages, they supervise their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16388.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not responsible for their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16391.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who works with our students, if we had an athletic team, if we had a club that met on the weekend, whoever is a supervisor has a glory check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16459.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you're making two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16460.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, for example, on parents night, parents come up for curriculum night, we don't quarry every parent who comes in the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16466.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not talking about parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16478.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're talking about a type of person in the building, but there's all kinds of people who come into this building who are not quarried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16484.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16527.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand what you're saying, but that's not the standard of Corey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16532.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Corey check requires when a person has unsupervised contact, a frequent visitor kind of thing, so if a person's going to use the media studio, and they're going to come up here more than once, I assume they're going to try to use the studio more than once, they're not becoming a member to only have one production or one activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16550.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they're a frequent action person up here, and so it doesn't hurt to know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16556.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16591.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could walk into the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16593.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They go out the main door of the studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16632.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rentals and parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16646.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: including everybody sitting around the table tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16668.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and have access to a particular area of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16704.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, look, it's obviously a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16706.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=16709.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18095.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President, let me just make a couple quick comments on CORI so everyone understands how CORIs work, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18101.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, a CORI check is very quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18103.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You fill out the paperwork, you bring in your material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18106.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, identification is required to ensure that you are actually the person who is being CORI checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18113.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's just a safeguard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18115.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You get it back in about 24 hours or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18118.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's that quick, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18120.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you're denied employment or volunteer status on a Cori check, what happens is you then can be told why you're denied, and you have a right to appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18134.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I can't share a Cori.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18136.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I get a Cori, and I'm the person who reviews Coris in the school department, I can't share that Cori with anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18142.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18144.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18148.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: insurance violation, failure to register your car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18151.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of those things that show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18153.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those things are not terribly important to me unless, in fact, you're driving a bus or you're doing something that might be related to the particular offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18162.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, substances, things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18165.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when it happened, how it happened, did it happen last week, last year, or did it happen 20 years ago when you were a kid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18171.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, those things are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18173.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, you look at those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18175.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's say you're denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18177.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a right to get your Cori checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18179.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a right to make it public yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18182.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're denied for something stupid or something you think is discriminatory, you can make that public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18188.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't, but you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18190.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So any issuing authority has to keep it quiet, has to look at it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18196.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But an individual who's affected by it has every right to protest that, in fact, their Cori was denied for some superficial reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18205.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18207.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can't discriminate just simply because, you know, I don't like you because you're a person who says things that I don't like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18214.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has to be a substantive reason or a person has a right to appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18219.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, people come in and they say, you know, that happened so many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18223.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been this way for so many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18225.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you give me a chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18227.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18228.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want you to understand how that process works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18231.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, within the school system, everybody has to be fingerprinted as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18235.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an FBI check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18238.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not volunteers, but people who are employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18240.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Think of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18242.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a whole series of things that have to go on in our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18246.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the nature of society today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18249.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are very concerned about safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18251.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're very concerned about who's there, who's in contact with their young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18256.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of steps involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18257.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you do have a right to protest an adverse decision on your car for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18892.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here all night, and three motions on the agenda tonight, I stayed to answer them, and they just got tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18900.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like to be given the courtesy of making a couple of comments if I can, because I've issued you a couple of reports that the school committee received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18908.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe some people don't want to hear the facts, but nevertheless, here they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18926.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18927.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have any, your resolution was on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18929.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I came here and stayed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18934.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I gave it to you when I thought you were busy with another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18938.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to trade with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18939.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'd like a moment as a citizen to be able to address the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18949.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18951.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just want to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18952.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are three reports on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18954.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee received these reports last night, or received the update last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18962.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let him speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18964.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are we in public participation, or are we in suspending the rules?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18981.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the Council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18983.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, on the agenda, there are items that dealt with enrollment in real estate development and the impact upon class size, the impact upon enrollment in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=18996.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you hear this and you are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19000.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19002.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One report was done at the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19005.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second report was done this week and given to the school committee and they had a discussion on it last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19012.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you know this because there are some things flying around the community that are just patently not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19018.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you know it, so that when you're asked these questions in public, you can answer them truthfully, and you have the statistics in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19027.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to refer to the report that was given last night, because I think that's the most relevant one right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19033.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It talks about the impact of real estate development on class size, class enrollment in the Metro Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19042.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we picked eight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19045.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: units or eight different developments in the city with 150 or more units in it and looked at the class size impact, looked at the impact of student enrollment by school, by grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19064.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by different development to give you an idea of what the impact is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19069.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read it closely, you'll find that there's 105 students in eight developments that come to our public schools, 105.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19078.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of them are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19082.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of them are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19084.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you spread them out and look at it, the average class size in the elementary schools is 18.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19092.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the best in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19094.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost the best in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19096.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19097.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You support the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19098.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee supports the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19100.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19102.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you've got good class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19103.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you've asked the question about class size over and over again at the various meetings that I've attended on budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19110.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think you should have that as you go into the campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19113.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19114.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a rumor going around that somewhere development is overrunning the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19121.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The schools are overwhelmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19122.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19124.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19125.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go over the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19126.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to go over it with you now because it's late and you can read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19129.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's important that you know this as you move around the city and people ask you about development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19135.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Development is important to support the various initiatives, to reduce the tax rate, to do all the things that you want to do in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19143.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the same time, it's a legitimate concern to determine whether or not it's going to cost you more money in your public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19150.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, right now, we're doing just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19153.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now you could add 155 seats to the elementary schools and still be below 20 students in a class on average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19163.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You could add 500 seats and still have decent class size at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19178.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now there may be some need for some looking at distribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19182.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school maybe has a little bit less than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19185.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19186.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19188.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you should know as a city council, you should know as the people that help to fund the budget and do development in the city, that your schools have sufficient capacity to handle additional students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19202.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19204.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should also know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19206.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that our schools are doing just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19208.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're part of the support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19209.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of great programs going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19211.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you're here tonight in this auditorium, which has been renovated in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19217.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to see any number of other additional renovations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19220.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last night, the school committee received a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19223.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on the merger between the high school and the vocational school and the exciting programs that are taking place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19230.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we welcome the opportunity when the new Bistro 49 is there to have you there and to see that and to see how the youngsters use the new resources that you have helped to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19241.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last spring I came to you and I asked you to support the submission of an SOI to the School Building Authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19248.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The School Building Authority will be in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19252.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on October 5 to begin their site visit to determine whether or not we can receive funding for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19259.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can look at that as another possibility of developing our schools, our programs, and moving things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19266.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a lot of good is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19268.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I welcome the opportunity to share that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19270.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell you that the discussion about overwhelmed numbers in the schools are not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19279.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19281.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look at the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19282.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to answer any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19285.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to know that, and just in case you get asked on the street, and when you have to make development decisions, I want you to be fully informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19294.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=19295.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, and have a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4268.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=4280.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13992.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm here, Mr. Vice President, as tonight's security, because you were concerned about that, as I mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=13999.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, you're providing the security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14000.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm wearing blue, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14005.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Feel safe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14008.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14008.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's your answer?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14009.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14011.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do quarry checks on everyone who has unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14018.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's anyone who works here, a contractor, anyone who comes in like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14026.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: dedicated door that you can't go from the studio into the high school once it's fully operational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14032.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we're still using it with students so they can go during the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14037.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are any number of activities that students have that people coming up here in the afternoon might interact with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14045.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I think that the city, and I don't have an objection to taking the extra step in making sure that anyone who might be up here frequently, who is moving around that area outside of the studio into the area, might find their way into the front door at a given time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14063.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we check it out a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14065.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as other groups go, we've rented properties for years, and we haven't required it because generally they're under the supervision of people, and the people there are on a volunteer basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14076.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, it really isn't exactly the same thing, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra measure of precaution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14116.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our students are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14118.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we had a coach, and they were coaching on the field, they'd be quarried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14122.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we have a rental out there, they're not our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14127.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14131.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the requirement of the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14137.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, but access to the building isn't the standard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14139.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people who have access to the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14141.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A parent comes up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14144.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're checked in, but they're not quarried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14146.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So access to the building is one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14148.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The standard for quarrying is unsupervised contact with students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14187.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, you can have a person walking on the street and have them contact with someone who's inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14195.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this building,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14196.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we have a rental, and we have a situation where people, let's say the Japanese language school, because that's the sanity reference you're making, they have their own students, they have their own people, they have their own coverages, they supervise their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14212.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not responsible for their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14215.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who works with our students, if we had an athletic team, if we had a club that met on the weekend, whoever is a supervisor has a quarry check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14224.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on top of that, most instances has a fingerprint check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14282.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you're making two different things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14284.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, for example, on parents night, parents come up for curriculum night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14287.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't quarry every parent who comes in the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14292.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14302.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're talking about a type of person in the building, but there's all kinds of people who come into this building who are not chlorinated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14350.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand what you're saying, but that's not the standard of Corey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14355.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Corey check requires when a person has unsupervised contact, a frequent visitor kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14363.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if a person's going to use the media studio, and they're going to come up here more than once, I assume they're going to try to use the studio more than once, they're not becoming a member to only have one production or one activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14374.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they're a frequent action person up here, and so it doesn't hurt to know who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14380.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14380.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, but it would be supervision, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14414.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could walk into the front of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14416.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They go out the main door of the studio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14455.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't tell who's who's a problem on a given day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14458.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14485.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's unreasonable if a person is going to be up here frequently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14492.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have access to a particular area of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14517.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not working with our students directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14519.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working with their population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14526.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, look, it's obviously a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14531.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=14532.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15918.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: President, let me just make a couple quick comments on CORI so everyone understands how CORIs work, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15924.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, a CORI check is very quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15926.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You fill out the paperwork, you bring in your material, obviously identification is required to ensure that you are actually the person who is being CORI checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15937.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's just a safeguard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15939.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You get it back in about 24 hours or less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15942.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's that quick, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15944.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you're denied employment or volunteer status on a Cori check, what happens is you then can be told why you're denied, and you have a right to appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15957.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I can't share a Cori.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15960.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I get a Cori, and I'm the person who reviews Coris in the school department, I can't share that Cori with anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15965.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15968.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll give you an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15969.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Typically, DUI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15971.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: insurance violation, failure to register your car.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15974.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of those things that show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15977.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those things are not terribly important to me unless, in fact, you're driving a bus or you're doing something that might be related to the particular offense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15985.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, substances, things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15988.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when it happened, how it happened, did it happen last week, last year, or did it happen 20 years ago when you were a kid?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15994.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, those things are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15997.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, you look at those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=15998.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's say you're denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16000.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a right to get your Cory check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16002.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a right to make it public yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16005.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you're denied for something stupid or something you think is discriminatory, you can make that public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16011.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't, but you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16013.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So any issuing authority has to keep it quiet, has to look at it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16019.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But an individual who's affected by it has every right to protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16023.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that, in fact, that Corey was denied for some superficial reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16028.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16030.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can't discriminate just simply because, you know, I don't like you because you're a person who says things that I don't like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16037.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has to be a substantive reason or a person has a right to appeal it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16042.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, people come in and they say, you know, that happened so many years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16047.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been this way for so many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16048.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you give me a chance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16050.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16052.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just want you to understand how that process works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16054.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now within the school system, everybody has to be fingerprinted as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16059.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an FBI job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16061.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not volunteers, but people who are employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16064.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fingerprinted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16065.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a whole series of things that have to go on in our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16071.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the nature of society today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16073.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are very concerned about safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16074.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're very concerned about who's there, who's in contact with their young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16079.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of steps involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16080.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you do have a right to protest an adverse decision on your car for each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16710.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, I'd like to be heard for a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16713.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16715.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16717.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three motions on the agenda tonight, I stayed to answer them, and they just got tabled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16723.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like to be given the courtesy of making a couple of comments, if I can, because I've issued you a couple of reports that the school committee received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16732.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe some people don't want to hear the facts, but nevertheless, here they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16749.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16751.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your resolution was on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16753.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I came here and stayed here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16757.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I gave it to everyone, but I thought you wouldn't listen to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16761.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to trade with her.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16762.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'd like a moment as a citizen to be able to address the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16773.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16774.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just want to say something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16775.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are three reports on the agenda tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16778.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee received these reports last night, or received the update last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16785.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let him speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16803.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16806.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, on the agenda, there were items that dealt with enrollment and real estate development, and the impact upon class size, the impact upon enrollment in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16819.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you hear this, and you are aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16823.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you reports tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16825.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One report was done at the beginning of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16828.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second report was done this week and given to the school committee, and they had a discussion on it last night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16835.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you know this because there are some things flying around the community that are just patently not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16842.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important that you know it so that when you're asked these questions in public, you can answer them truthfully and you have the statistics in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16850.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm gonna refer to the report that was given last night because I think that's the most relevant one right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16857.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It talks about the impact of real estate development on class size, class enrollment in the Metro Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16866.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we picked eight units or eight different developments in the city with 150 or more units in it and looked at the class size impact, looked at the impact of student enrollment by school, by grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16887.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by different development to give you an idea of what the impact is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16892.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read it closely, you'll find that there's 105 students in eight developments that come to our public schools, 105.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16901.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of them are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16905.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of them are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16908.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you spread them out and look at it, the average class size in the elementary schools is 18.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16916.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the best in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16917.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost the best in the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16919.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16920.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You support the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16921.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee supports the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16923.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should be proud of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16925.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you've got good class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16927.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you've asked the question about class size over and over again at the various meetings that I've attended on budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16933.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think you should have that as you go into the campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16936.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you should know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16938.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there is a rumor going around that somewhere development is overrunning the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16944.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The schools are overwhelmed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16945.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16947.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16948.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go over the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16949.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to go over it with you now because it's late and you can read.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16952.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's important that you know this as you move around the city and people ask you about development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16959.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Development is important to support the various initiatives, to reduce the tax rate, to do all the things that you want to do in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16967.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the same time, it's a legitimate concern to determine whether or not it's going to cost you more money in your public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16973.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, right now, we're doing just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16976.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you could add 155 seats to the elementary schools and still be below 20 students in a class, on average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16986.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sorry, it's a flashlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16988.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16989.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your light?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16990.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16991.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16992.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just had it so I could see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=16995.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you could add 500 seats and still have decent class size at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17002.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there may be some need for some looking at distribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17006.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school maybe has a little bit less than another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17008.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's always the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17009.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You work on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17011.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you should know as a city council, you should know as the people that help to fund the budget and do development in the city,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17020.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that your schools have sufficient capacity to handle additional students right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17026.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17027.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should also know that our schools are doing just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17032.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're part of the support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17033.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of great programs going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17035.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you're here tonight in this auditorium, which has been renovated in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17040.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to see any number of other additional renovations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17043.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last night, the school committee received a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17047.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on the merger between the high school and the vocational school and the exciting programs that are taking place there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17053.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we welcome the opportunity when the new Bistro 49 is there to have you there and to see that and to see how the youngsters use the new resources that you have helped to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17065.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last spring I came to you and I asked you to support the submission of an SOI to the School Building Authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17071.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The School Building Authority will be in Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17075.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on October 5 to begin their site visit to determine whether or not we can receive funding for that purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17082.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can look at that as another possibility of developing our schools, our programs, and moving things forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17089.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a lot of good is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17091.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I welcome the opportunity to share that tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17093.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell you that the discussion about overwhelmed numbers in the schools are not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17103.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17104.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look at the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17105.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to answer any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17108.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to know that, and just in case you get asked on the street, and when you have to make development decisions, I want you to be fully informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17117.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CtRL2YQa7iI&t=17119.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, and have a good night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=98.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=103.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=104.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=244.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=245.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We, Mustangs, are with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=247.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From us to you, we support you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=286.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From the Medford Mustang softball team to the Kingwood Mustang softball team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/41axa1Kc_Wg&t=292.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's winning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=224.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=227.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, on the 6th of September, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=231.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=232.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Knowles went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=248.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a piece of paper, which I'll provide to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=253.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Enroll to the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=254.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=255.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was denied again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=259.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=274.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But more importantly, I was able to get consent from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=282.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=289.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover public schools as they were in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=298.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, more than attending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=299.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're attending the North Andover public schools and not out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=306.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=308.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=315.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The parents have to work out their arrangement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=318.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=321.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=326.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the court has told them repeatedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=328.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=329.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they work it out, and Medford is the choice, then they will be enrolled, registered, and students in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=337.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, the concern was, are they getting an education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=340.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in the North Andover public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=343.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Principal Landry has confirmed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=346.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=349.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, this has been going on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=352.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't something that only came about in the last month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=355.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=359.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so they've got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=361.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=366.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=371.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've consulted with our legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=374.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've gone over this matter multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=376.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've spoken to North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=378.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in the North Andover public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=380.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=385.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way to move on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=388.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=411.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Didn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=419.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=429.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=432.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=442.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=445.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We consulted with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=447.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=451.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the state actually asked us, and I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=458.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=461.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We declined to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=479.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=484.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=484.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=486.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Get together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=487.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Solve the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=489.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=492.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=493.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not me to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=495.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's for you to solve it with the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=499.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=501.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=501.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the court wants you to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=504.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=507.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court denied it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=950.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in Medford the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North Andover and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=961.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=968.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=974.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1248.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me ask this, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1252.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1259.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1261.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's filed the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1263.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If she thought that we didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1267.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a solid position, she'd be in our face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1270.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1270.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1273.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1275.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's the legal representative for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1281.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1284.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1284.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1290.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I called the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1294.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1297.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They went over it and quite frankly They're sustained our position so if believe me if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled the Department of Elementary and secondary education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my Opportunity to do so believe me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1314.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would not let me do we've been in through this many times with with desi if there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1322.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1328.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1347.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I did that today because I got a note from Greg Landry, who's the principal at Atkinson, says they're enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1357.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, I spoke to DESE today, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1374.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1379.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1384.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be a decision made by a third party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1387.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll be happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1388.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go-ahead, but we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1581.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1585.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1588.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1591.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1598.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leave them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1603.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other child, okay, so they're two together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1607.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1617.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're gonna play one off against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1619.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1629.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court will make a decision, and you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1633.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1636.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1637.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1638.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We like children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1653.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're at a council, I tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1921.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1923.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't know your status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1925.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as far as I know, you're a significant other, but not a custodial parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1932.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1932.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, I can't talk to you about the trial technically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1937.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, I don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1938.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one gave me that permission yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1940.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a complicated little circle here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1945.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's filled with all kinds of potholes of things that we can and can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1951.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if the court had said, you can put them in part time, but the court is probably saying, I don't want to split the week up for these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1962.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let them be in one place and not in two places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2003.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our deputy superintendent to take the lead on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2009.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford, and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2308.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2749.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our director of curriculum, Bernadette Riccidelli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3251.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's embargoed, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3254.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3261.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3270.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3275.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things, but we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3308.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just answer that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3311.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the thing that you've got to remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3313.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3317.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions, you know, they had to see what it was about, whether it really, you know, the questions were proper and the like, and they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3331.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3332.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: rather than it's like a new product, it's really in a pilot phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3335.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the second year, they're saying, OK, you had a year to try it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3339.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had a year to work out the bugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3341.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we'll start to look at it for real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3343.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3344.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't really an attempt to hide anything, because I think some people in the state would love to issue accountability ratings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3350.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3356.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'd have to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3437.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We always do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3439.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just look at schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3440.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there's a lot of things you want to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3442.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight was a good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3444.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll get a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3445.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3454.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3455.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way, where it goes, how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3469.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3478.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3490.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3493.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3498.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll have to see where that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3500.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3511.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3515.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3518.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I think there's a lot of good material in there looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3525.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about social and emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3527.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about career and technical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3529.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3531.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All those things are important in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3533.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3535.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not just developing test takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3537.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a good school in a community like, you know, in Boston, where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3551.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools and what we do, needs more scrutiny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3557.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3629.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3634.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fascinating kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3636.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English language arts test because it was his first year in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3648.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade, he had been in the country for a short period of time, the state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3659.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had to petition and clean that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3661.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3667.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an example of a discrepancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3669.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medicals, people that are out on a medical who somehow don't get coded out of the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3675.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All of a sudden, you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3679.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, how can you count them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3680.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3684.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are some of the things that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3686.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3694.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3697.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not what you're going to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3699.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3703.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3725.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, Beverly's going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=4456.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a return visit from Emily, straight from Market Basket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5475.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you go down that road, our schools were built on a racial balance plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5484.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schools were built with choice as one of the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5487.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5495.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, you could choose elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5497.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5501.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5505.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people, you know, it was a, let's say a progressive movement of youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5511.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5516.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5520.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's happened all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5522.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But now people are getting settled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5523.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're getting comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5524.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5527.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5534.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5543.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5548.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just got to look at those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5549.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's all part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5551.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5565.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5568.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5570.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We grant a lot of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5572.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5574.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we grant a lot of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5576.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at class size first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5578.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5582.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We look at the balance between different populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5586.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have granted quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5588.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane, what would you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5590.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because Diane handles the elementaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5664.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5689.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5699.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then no one gets a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5702.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This trade-off, so all of these systems, for the most part, it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5706.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a year where we have one real aberration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5709.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlynn, it's within a few students of each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5722.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5723.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an aberration this particular year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5902.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5907.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so there was some desire that maybe we should move people to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5912.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5916.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Diane, you may want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5977.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Long time ago, long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5981.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6072.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6074.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6076.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Irving and Gleason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6085.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those were the three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6086.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6089.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we needed to take to the Columbus, because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6096.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus, or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6107.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was the sort of divide there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6109.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, with busing transportation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6112.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we felt it was very doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6113.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the thinking at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6621.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6626.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6630.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other school has to want to compete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6632.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other school has to want to pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6645.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a certain amount of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6647.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6649.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6653.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6654.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6658.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sending a message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6660.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the way you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6661.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6662.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6670.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we sent a message and we changed some things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6672.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6679.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the school of choice, you want to bring people to you, then you've got to step it up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6683.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6688.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6706.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6712.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6713.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6717.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that was not as significant years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6721.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6722.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now emerged, and it will continue to emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6727.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a new challenge for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6728.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, we work at these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6731.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every year there's going to be challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6733.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6734.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6735.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6735.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got a lot of things moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6737.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6738.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're certainly not being satisfied about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6741.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're saying, let's go make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6742.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everybody on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6744.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be, woe is me, they did something to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6747.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got to step up too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6749.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6949.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they were defaulted to McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under enrolled in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6974.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a report you asked for, and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda to ask me these questions, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6984.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here, so I'm going to go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6991.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6996.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7003.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7006.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7016.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7024.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7030.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7035.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of the students are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7037.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7044.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7051.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7058.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7070.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7077.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7086.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7090.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We currently have 937.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7092.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7097.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7101.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are saying there's no capacity anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7103.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new developments are going to swamp the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7106.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7108.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school vocational program has room to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7111.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7115.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7120.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7125.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7133.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7141.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to take you to the first chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7147.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're looking at the eight big complexes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7152.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7157.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7162.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Edge Drive, you only have 11 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7166.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families have more than one child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7169.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7171.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of these complexes have existed for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7174.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not brand new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7175.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been here for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7177.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are in outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7188.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me go to the next chart for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7192.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7201.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, Lumiere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7204.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7208.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7212.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And grade one, 18.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7216.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 2, 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7217.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 3, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7219.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 4, 19.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7222.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 5, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7225.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those class sizes are private school class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7229.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7234.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've done an excellent job supporting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7237.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7242.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is misleading everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7243.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7293.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that near?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7294.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been there forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7300.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7315.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when their families grow, they move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7317.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't stay in these developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7318.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7320.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're going to have to see what that does because basically, you know, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not going to be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7367.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing you need to know, the other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7373.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7377.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8260.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8266.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=8267.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=224.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, on the 6th of September, I believe,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=231.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Attorney for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=233.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Knowles went to court and asked, once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=249.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=253.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Enroll to the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=255.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a second thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=256.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was denied again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=260.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=275.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who is the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=290.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=299.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, enrolled and attending, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=300.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=307.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=309.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My answer is that they're enrolled in a North Andover public school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=316.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, the parents have to work out their arrangement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=319.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=322.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=326.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the court has told them repeatedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=329.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=330.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=334.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: enrolled, registered in students in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=338.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But right now, the concern was, are they getting an education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=341.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in the North Andover Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=343.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Principal Landry has confirmed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=346.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work at them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=350.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, this has been going on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=353.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't something that only came about in the last month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=356.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=360.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, you know, they've got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=362.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=367.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=372.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've consulted with our legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=375.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've gone over this matter multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=377.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've spoken to North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=379.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in the North Andover public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=381.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=386.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way to move on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=388.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=412.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Didn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=420.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, the court said that Cheryl Knowles does not have the right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=429.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=433.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=443.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=446.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We consulted with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=448.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=452.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the state actually asked us, I'm going to say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=459.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=462.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We declined to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=480.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=483.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but that's not yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=485.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=485.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=487.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Get together, solve the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=489.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just say yes, Mr. Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=490.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And whatever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=493.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=494.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not me to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=496.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's for you to solve it with the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=500.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=502.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=502.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the court wants you to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=504.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=508.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court denied it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=944.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Temporarily until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=951.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in men from the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North and over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=962.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=969.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not gonna try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=975.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1250.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me ask this, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1252.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because we're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1260.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1262.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's filed the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1264.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If she thought that we didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1268.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a solid position, she'd be in our face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1270.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1271.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1274.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1276.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's the legal representative for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1278.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1282.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1284.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1285.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1291.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I called the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1294.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1298.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They went over it and quite frankly, they sustained our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1303.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So believe me, if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my opportunity to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1314.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Believe me, they would not let me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1317.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been through this many times with Desi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1319.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1323.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1329.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1348.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I did that today because I got a note from Greg Landry, who's the principal at Atkinson, says they're enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1358.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I spoke to Dessie today too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1375.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there, whether it's, it can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1384.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be a decision made by a third party, and I'll be happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1389.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go-ahead, but we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1582.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1586.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1589.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1592.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is, is the court probably is saying, one child was in North Andover last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1599.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leave them there, because quite frankly, they've got some stability there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1604.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other child, okay, so there's two together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1608.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1618.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're gonna play one off against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1620.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1630.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court will make a decision, and you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1634.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1637.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1638.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1639.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We like children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1641.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We like enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1654.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're at a council, I tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1922.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1924.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't know your status, but as far as I know, you're a significant other but not a custodial parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1931.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Am I right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1933.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so as a result, I can't talk to you about the child technically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1938.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, I don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1939.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one gave me that permission yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1940.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, so you know this this is a complicated little circle here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1945.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, this is it's filled with all kinds of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1948.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of things that we can and can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1952.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if the court had said, you know, you can put them in part-time, but the court is probably saying I don't want to split the week up for these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1962.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let them be in one place and not in two places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1964.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the problem with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1965.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2004.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our deputy superintendent to take the lead on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2010.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford, and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2309.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2720.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Stop and shop is still working out the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2724.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So tonight we'll put it aside and wait on the table, but I can assure you that There's gonna be a lot of competition between supermarkets and Mr. Skerry all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2750.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccidelli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3252.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, it's embargoed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3255.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3261.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you've read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3270.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3276.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3281.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3309.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I can just answer that a little bit, I think the thing that you've got to remember, this is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3318.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions, they had to see what it was about, whether it really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3327.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the questions were proper and the like, and they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3332.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than, it's like a new product, it's really in a pilot phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3336.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the second year, they're saying, okay, you had a year to try it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3340.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had a year to work out the bugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3342.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we'll start to look at it for real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3344.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3345.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't really an attempt to hide anything, because I think some people in the state would love to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3350.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: issue accountability ratings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3351.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3357.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3438.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We always do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3440.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's just look at schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3441.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there's a lot of things we want to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3443.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight was a good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3445.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll get a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3446.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3455.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3456.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3468.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where it goes, how it goes, but you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3478.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3491.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3494.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3499.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll have to see where that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3500.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3512.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3516.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it, because I think there's a lot of good material in there looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3526.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about social and emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3528.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about career and technical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3530.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3531.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All those things are important in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3533.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3536.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not just developing test takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3538.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a good school in a community like in Boston where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3552.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools and what we do needs more scrutiny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3557.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3630.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3635.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fascinating kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3637.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English language arts test because it was his first year in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3649.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3653.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, he had been in the country for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3656.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3659.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had to petition and clean that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3662.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3667.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an example of a discrepancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3670.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medicals, people that are out on a medical who somehow don't get coded out of the thing, all of a sudden you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3680.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, how can you count them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3681.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3685.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are some of the things that happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3687.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3695.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3698.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not what you're going to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3700.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3704.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3726.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dave Beverly's going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3729.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have Anthony with me tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=4457.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a return visit from Evely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=4464.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Stop and shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5476.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Before you go down that road, our schools were built on a racial balance plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5485.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schools were built with choice as one of the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5488.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5496.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, you could choose elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5498.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5501.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5506.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people, you know, it was a, let's say, a progressive movement of youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5512.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5517.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5521.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's happened all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5522.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But now people are getting settled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5524.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're getting comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5525.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5528.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5534.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5543.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5549.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just got to look at those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5550.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's all part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5552.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5566.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5569.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe we don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5571.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We grant a lot of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5573.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5575.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we grant a lot of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5577.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at class size first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5579.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5583.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We look at the balance between different populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5587.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have granted quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5589.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane, what would you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5591.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because Diane handles the elementaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5664.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5690.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5698.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then no one gets a choice, you know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5701.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, this trade-off, so all of these systems, you know, for the most part it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5707.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a year where we have one real aberration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5709.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlinn, it's within a few students of each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5722.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5724.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an aberration this particular year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5903.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5908.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so there was some desire to maybe we should move people to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5913.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5917.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Diane, you may want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5978.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Long time ago, long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5982.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6071.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6073.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6075.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6077.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Hervey and Gleason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6086.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those were the three, but there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6090.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we needed to take to the Columbus because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6096.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6108.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was the sort of divide there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6110.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, with busing transportation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6113.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we felt it was very doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6114.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was the thinking at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6621.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6626.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school, the other school has to want to compete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6633.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other school has to want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6635.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6646.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a certain amount of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6647.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6650.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6654.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6655.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6659.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sending a message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6661.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the way you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6662.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6663.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6671.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we sent a message and we changed some things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6673.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6680.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school of choice, you want to bring people to you, and you've got to step it up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6684.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6689.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6700.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6706.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6713.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6714.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6718.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that was not as significant years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6722.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6723.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now emerged, and it will continue to emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6725.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a new challenge for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6728.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a new challenge for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6729.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, you know, we work at these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6731.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, every year there's going to be challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6734.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6735.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6736.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6736.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got a lot of things moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6738.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6739.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're certainly not being satisfied about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6742.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're saying, let's go make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6743.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everybody on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6745.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be, woe is me, you know, they did something to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6950.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they would default it to the McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under-enrolled, the sixth grade, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6974.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a report you asked for and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6982.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to ask me these questions, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6984.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6988.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6992.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6997.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7003.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7007.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7017.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7024.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7031.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7035.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of the students are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7038.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7045.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7052.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7058.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7071.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7078.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7087.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7091.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We currently have 937.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7093.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7098.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7102.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are saying there's no capacity anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7104.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new developments are going to swamp the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7107.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7109.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school vocational program has room to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7112.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7116.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7121.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7126.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7134.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7142.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to take you to the first chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7147.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're looking at the eight big complexes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7153.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7158.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7163.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Ed Drive, you only have 11 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7167.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families have more than one child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7170.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7172.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of these complexes have existed for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7175.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not brand new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7176.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been here for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7178.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7188.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me go to the next chart for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7202.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, Lumiere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7204.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7209.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7213.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And grade one, 18.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7217.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 2, 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7218.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 3, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7220.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 4, 19.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7223.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 5, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7225.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those class sizes are private school class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7230.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7235.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've done an excellent job supporting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7238.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7242.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is misleading everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7244.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7294.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that near?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7295.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been there forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7301.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7316.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when their families grow, they move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7318.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't stay in these developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7319.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7322.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're gonna have to see what that does because basically, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not gonna be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7368.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing you need to know, the other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7374.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7378.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=8262.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=8267.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=8268.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=457.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=464.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Attorney for Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=466.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Knowles went to court and asked once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=482.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=486.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Enroll to the public schools, it's a second thing, and it was denied again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=492.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=508.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who was the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=522.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=531.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, enrolled and attending, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=532.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=540.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=542.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=548.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, the parents have to work out their arrangement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=551.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=555.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=559.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the court has told them repeatedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=562.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=563.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=567.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Enrolled registered and students in the Medford public schools, but right now the concern was are they getting an education?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=574.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were in the north end over public schools and principal Landry has confirmed that and I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=579.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=582.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, this has been going on for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=585.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't something that only came about in the last month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=588.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=592.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so they've got to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=595.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=600.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=604.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've consulted with our legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=607.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've gone over this matter multiple times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=609.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've spoken to North Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=611.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in the North Andover public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=613.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=618.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way to move on the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=621.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=644.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Didn't do anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=653.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, from our standpoint, the court said that Carol Knowles does not have the right<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=662.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=665.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=674.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=676.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=678.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We consulted with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=680.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=685.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the state actually asked us, I'm gonna say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=692.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=695.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We declined to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=712.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=715.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, but that's not yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=717.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=717.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=720.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Get together, solve the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=722.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just say yes, Mr. Belsey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=722.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And whenever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=726.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=726.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not me to say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=728.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's for you to solve it with the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=733.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=734.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=735.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the court wants you to work it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=737.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=741.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court denied it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1176.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Temporarily until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1184.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in men from the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North and over<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1194.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1202.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1207.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1482.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me ask this, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1486.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1492.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1495.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's filed the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1496.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If she thought that we didn't have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1500.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a solid position, she'd be in our face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1503.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1504.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1507.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1508.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's the legal representative for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1514.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1517.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1518.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1523.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I called the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1527.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1530.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They went over it and quite frankly, they sustained our position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1535.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So believe me, if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my opportunity to do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1547.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Believe me, they would not let me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1549.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been through this many times with Desi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1552.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1555.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1562.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1608.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there, whether it's, it can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1617.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be a decision made by a third party, and I'll be happy to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1622.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go ahead, but we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1814.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1818.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1822.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1825.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1832.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Leave them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1836.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other child, okay, so they're two together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1840.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1851.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're gonna play one off against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1853.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1862.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The court will make a decision, then you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1867.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1869.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1870.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1872.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We like children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1873.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We like enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1886.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're at a council, I tell you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2154.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just say one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2157.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't know your status, but as far as I know, you're a significant other but not a custodial parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2164.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Am I right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2165.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so as a result, I can't talk to you about the child technically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2170.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, I don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2171.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one gave me that permission yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2173.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, so you know this this is a complicated little circle here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2178.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean this it's filled with all kinds of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2181.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of things that we can and can't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2184.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if the court had said, you know, you can put them in part-time, but the court is probably saying, I don't want to split the week up for these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2195.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let them be in one place and not in two places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2197.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably what they did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2198.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2237.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to take the lead on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2242.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2541.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2953.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Stop and shop is still working out the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2956.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So tonight we'll put it aside and wait on the table, but I can assure you that There's gonna be a lot of competition between supermarkets and Mr. Skerry all those in favor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2983.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccadeli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3485.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's embargoed, Dave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3488.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3494.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3503.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3508.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3513.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3542.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I can just answer that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3545.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the thing that you gotta remember<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3547.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3551.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3557.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had to see what it was about, whether it really, you know, the questions were proper and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3562.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3564.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So rather than, it's like a new product.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3567.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really in a pilot phase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3569.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the second year, they're saying, okay, you had a year to try it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3572.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had a year to work out the bugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3574.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we'll start to look at it for real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3576.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3577.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't really an attempt to hide anything because I think some people in the state would love to issue accountability ratings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3584.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3589.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'd have to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3671.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We always do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3673.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's just look at schedules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3674.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there's a lot of things you want to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3676.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight was a good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3677.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll get a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3679.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3687.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3689.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3701.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Where it goes, how it goes, but you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3711.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3723.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3726.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3732.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll have to see where that plays out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3733.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3744.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3749.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3752.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I think there's a lot of good material in there, looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3758.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about social and emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3760.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about career and technical education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3763.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3764.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All those things are important in a school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3766.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3769.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not just developing test takers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3771.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a good school in a community like in Boston, where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3784.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools, and what we do needs more scrutiny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3790.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3863.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3868.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fascinating kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3869.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English Language Arts test because it was his first year in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3881.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3886.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, he had been in the country for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3888.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3892.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had to petition and clean that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3895.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3900.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an example of a discrepancy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3902.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medicals, people that are out on a medical, who somehow don't get coded out of the thing, all of a sudden you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3913.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, how can you count them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3914.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3918.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are some of the things that happen, and you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids, and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3927.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3931.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what you've got to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3932.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3937.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=3958.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dave, Beverly's going to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4690.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a return visit from Evely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4693.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Straight from Market Basket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4696.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Stop and shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=4697.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Stop and shop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5717.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schools were built with choice as one of the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5721.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5730.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5734.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5739.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was, let's say, a progressive movement of youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5745.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5749.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5754.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's happened all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5755.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But now people are getting settled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5757.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're getting comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5758.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5761.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5767.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5776.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5782.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just got to look at those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5783.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's all part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5785.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5799.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5802.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe you don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5804.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We grant a lot of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5805.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5808.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we grant a lot of requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5809.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at class size first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5812.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5816.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We look at the balance between different populations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5820.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have granted quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5822.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane, what would you say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5824.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because Diane handles the elementaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5897.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5923.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5933.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, then no one gets a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5934.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5936.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, this trade-off, so all of these systems, for the most part it's worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5939.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a year where we have one real aberration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5942.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlynn, it's within a few students of each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5956.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=5957.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an aberration this particular year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6136.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6141.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so there was some desire that maybe we should move people to one school or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6146.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6149.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Diane, you may want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6211.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6211.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Long time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6215.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6305.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6308.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the schools were built,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6310.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Irving and Gleason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6319.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those were the three, but there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6323.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we needed to take to the Columbus because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6329.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6341.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was the sort of divide there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6343.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course with busing transportation, we felt it was very doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6348.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was the thinking at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6855.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6859.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school, the other school has to want to compete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6866.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other school has to want to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6868.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6879.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a certain amount of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6880.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6882.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6887.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to change that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6888.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6892.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sending a message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6893.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the way you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6895.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6896.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6904.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we sent a message and we changed some things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6906.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6913.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school of choice, you want to bring people to you, and you've got to step it up a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6917.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6922.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6931.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not federal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6939.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6946.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6947.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6951.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, that was not as significant years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6954.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6955.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now emerged and it will continue to emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6958.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a new challenge for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6960.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a new challenge for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6962.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, you know, we work at these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6964.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, every year there's going to be challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6967.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6968.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make it work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6969.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6969.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got a lot of things moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6971.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6972.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're certainly not being satisfied about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6975.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're saying, let's go make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6976.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need everybody on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6978.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be, woe is me, you know, they did something to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=6982.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got to step up too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7183.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, they were defaulted to the McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under-enrolled in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7206.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a report you asked for and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7214.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to ask me these questions, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7217.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7220.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm gonna go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7225.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7230.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7236.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7240.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7250.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7257.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7264.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7268.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two of the students are in outside placements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7271.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7277.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7285.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7291.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7304.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7311.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7320.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7323.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We currently have 937.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7326.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7331.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7335.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People say there's no capacity anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7337.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new developments are going to swamp the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7340.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7342.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school vocational program has room to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7344.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7349.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7354.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7358.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7367.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7376.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to take you to the first chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7380.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're looking at the eight big complexes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7386.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7391.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7396.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Ed Drive, you only have 11 families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7400.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families have more than one child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7403.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7405.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of these complexes have existed for some time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7408.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not brand new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7409.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been here for a while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7410.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7421.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me go to the next chart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7435.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, Lumiere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7437.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7442.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7446.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade one, 18.8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7450.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 2, 18.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7451.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 3, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7453.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 4, 19.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7456.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In grade 5, 17.7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7458.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those class sizes are private school class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7462.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7468.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've done an excellent job supporting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7471.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7475.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is misleading everyone, we're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7527.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that near?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7528.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been there forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7534.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7548.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when their families grow, they move out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7551.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't stay in these developments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7552.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7555.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're gonna have to see what that does because basically, you know, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not gonna be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7601.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It looks like it's more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7602.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7607.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=7611.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8495.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8500.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=8501.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=10622.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=10628.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=10629.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=11744.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=11750.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=11751.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=12335.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=12340.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=12341.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Go Mustangs!<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=194.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The library is going to open, the first couple of weeks is getting everything in order, but we'll probably have the people in place over the next week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=584.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we have been talking about a merger of the high school and the vocational school for multiple years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=590.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a new topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=592.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fact that it's starting to happen obviously brings about change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=597.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And change is sometimes difficult for everyone to understand what it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=603.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vocational school has its own identity by virtue of the fact it's governed by Chapter 74.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=609.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And youngsters will get occupational proficiency certificates and other aspects that are purely vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=615.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The opportunity for the high school students to explore programs at the vocational school was one of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=621.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The opportunity for vocational students to take advanced courses at the high school was one of our goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=627.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The opportunity to share faculty members was one of our goals, and we've talked about this extensively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=633.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, change is difficult, and it warrants maybe another meeting, a committee of the whole, to go into it in great depth, to talk about the things you're concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=643.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we did talk about merging, and we talked about some of the sharing of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=650.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as class officers and things of that go, those are things that can be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=654.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in terms of sharing classes, in terms of sharing programs, having 240 youngsters explore CTE options is something that never could have been done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=666.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Class rank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=668.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=669.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Class rank, those things are all things that would come together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=673.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, there's some misunderstandings or perhaps some serious questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=677.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, let's have a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=678.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's go into it in great depth so that everyone understands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=681.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if there's a modification that has to be made, we'll talk about making it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=685.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing is reporting to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=688.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we have two codes in reporting to the state, we're going to gum up our ability to report to the state in an efficient and effective way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=697.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to talk it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=700.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went down this road because we felt this would give our youngsters greater opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=704.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, maybe we didn't explain it well enough, or maybe there needs to be more explanation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=709.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe we need to hear from some students and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=711.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, this was something that we've talked about extensively for multiple years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=716.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's have a committee to hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=717.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1500.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1503.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So school year 2017 and 2018 officially began on Tuesday, August 29th, for students grades one to 12 and for kindergarten students on Wednesday, September 6th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1514.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And overall, it was a good opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1516.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As usual, there were a few items that required adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1519.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Administration, faculty, staff invested substantial time and expertise to get a positive result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1526.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This evening, you'll hear specific reports that document the opening, and additional reports will be forthcoming in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1533.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a school committee, you have been very supportive in supporting a number of the programs and budget lines that I'll enumerate right now, talking about some of the improvements that are now involved in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1544.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So significant maintenance and construction around the district was accomplished.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1548.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Various individual school projects will continue during the next few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1553.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new multimedia studio was completed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1556.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bistro 49 is about a month away from operational completion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1560.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additional parking has been added to the high school complex, replacing the skateboard park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1565.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a number of capital fund projects will be advanced this fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1568.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Class sizes are very good throughout the district, and you have a detailed chart in your materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1575.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: New members of our management team have been hired and have been made an excellent transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1579.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Major positions include a Vocational Technical Principal Director, an ELL Director, a Brooks Assistant Principal, Director of Fine Arts, McGlynn Middle Assistant Principal, and Director of Technology have all assumed their roles quite seamlessly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1594.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've hired 62 new personnel this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1598.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a chart attached to this report to fill vacant slots and to enhance our programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1605.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our elementary science program has substantial new materials and we're actively piloting a new textbook series.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1612.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each school is receiving a minimum of 50 new Chromebooks with charging cards to enhance our technology utilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1619.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've expanded our library staff to support expanded hours at the high school and better access at the K-8 programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1625.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The middle schools have more foreign language this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1629.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The additional health teacher at the middle school will ensure that all students have access to the Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1634.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a special grant from the Attorney General's funds will enhance our opiate prevention education initiative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1640.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A special grant from the Cummings Foundation will support expanded citizenship and community service education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1647.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A grant from the state treasurer will support a new financial literacy initiative entitled Credit for Life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1653.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A global scholars program will be expanded and we will participate in an international symposium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1659.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our high school vocational school merger is moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1663.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it benefits students grades nine to 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1666.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've just had this discussion, so I'll put that off until we have our committee in the hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1671.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have maintained a comprehensive curriculum that offers a full range of courses to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1676.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unlike many other school systems, art and music have been enhanced and not cut back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1681.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once again, we have finished the year with a balanced budget, despite federal and state cutbacks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1686.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working collaboratively to increase inclusivity in all our programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1690.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our early childhood programs are among the best in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1693.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The family network is a wonderful resource to young families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1696.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have excellent before and after school programs available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1699.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll receive some reports on that this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1703.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each new year brings some challenges, and this year is no exception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1707.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm confident that we'll meet our challenges and make progress in all areas of our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1711.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MCAS 2.0 will be in full force in 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1715.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This past year was a trial year, and we will be receiving authorization to release results sometime in October.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1724.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A new test using some different formats certainly requires our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1728.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Federal and state finance is uncertain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1731.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expanded attempts at privatization and reductions in key line items will require resourceful creativity to meet our needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1738.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are already some programs that have felt the cut from Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1741.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are others that are being proposed and being a shift of funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1745.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A growing number of EL students will require modified programs that are responsive to the needs of those learners.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1750.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did move the newcomers program from the Roberts over to the Brooks, but it did also affect us in the transportation line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1759.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to talk about how those things work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1762.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expanded demands for technological capacity will require investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1766.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to file for additional funding to match the E-rate that we've filed in Washington, which will expand our capacity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1775.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to put on technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1777.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Spring 2018, we'll see a new coordinated program review of our district by DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1781.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It happens every six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1784.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1785.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe that Kathleen D'Aguilio and her staff are doing a great job putting that together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1790.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Applications for additional capital projects to improve our facilities will require substantial planning and follow through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1796.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On October 5th, we'll have a visit from SBA, School Building Authority,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1800.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to go over the SOI that you approved and City Council approved us to submit, and we'll see where we stand with that as possible improvements to this facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1809.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The review and adoption of several policies align with new laws and regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1814.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there's new laws and regulations that come out, and every year we have to think about how we're going to deal with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1819.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every year there's some little wrinkle that comes up that requires an adjustment on our part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1826.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The potential transition of key personnel will require planning and recruitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1830.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every year there's some transition of key players, just like we talked about earlier in my message.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1835.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need a plan for that so that we can go forward as smoothly as we are right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1842.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beyond the above concerns, it is important that we recognize that schools are much more than academic institutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1849.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The recent Phi Delta cap and poll of the public's attitudes towards public schools made the following statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1856.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Academic achievement isn't the only mission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1859.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Americans overwhelmingly support investments in career preparation and personal skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1865.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford has consistently advocated for the whole child and youth transition to adulthood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1871.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We must continue on that path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1873.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another key concern is media literacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1876.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We must help our students to develop the media literacy necessary to counteract the hateful ideas, the rhetoric, and the behaviors that are emerging unchallenged in our society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1887.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The late Senator Patrick Moynihan, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1895.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Opinion has become as true as facts today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1898.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The September edition of the Atlantic Monthly explained it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1901.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The internet and competing media outlets allows us to create communities that reinforce our preconceived beliefs with or without evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1911.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel said, the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1918.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our most important curriculum will always be a curriculum of caring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1924.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we begin a new school year, we must rededicate ourselves to truth, to love and human development, as well as academic proficiency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1932.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We cannot be indifferent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1934.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our students and our community need us to stand up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1937.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to help each other meet the challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1939.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no better time than the present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1942.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to embrace a curriculum of care, and I know we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1946.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2020.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2021.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about, and you have something in the back of your folder about an action plan going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2026.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not possible to make that change right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2029.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll work on that this year and hopefully by next year we'll smooth that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2033.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you notice the 7th and 8th grade, fairly close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2037.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The 6th grade is really remarkably different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2041.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's like 47, 48 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2043.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so that's a whole discussion and we've done some work on that and we'll be happy to present on that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2153.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I call upon our Deputy Superintendent, Beverly Nelson, to present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2580.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll call on Assistant Superintendent Diane Caldwell to present this report and to address the question raised by a member of the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3005.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's Trisha.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3008.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's important to understand that every time we move populations to different parts of the city, it impacts transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3017.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that when we did the newcomers program movement from the Roberts to the Brooks, it cost us an extra bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3025.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's tricky, we may have to look at redistricting as a better alternative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3033.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quite frankly, as the mayor points out, I think when you see the numbers coming out of the new developments, it hasn't really impacted us much at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3041.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it may in the future, but right now it hasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3124.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's not so much a wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3126.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a 48, 49 people differential between the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3130.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it was 14 on the wait list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3133.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3133.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if one goes, then the other 13 legitimately say, how come not me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3138.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this point in time, we really can't make any moves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3141.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Talked to a number of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3144.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people accept no better than other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3261.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the reason for that was the fact that, remember, there are any number of youngsters exploring over the vocational school right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3268.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's over 240 youngsters exploring in grade nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3273.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most flexible years, we're in grades 11 and 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3276.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A week and B week tends to come in to play for several of the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3280.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not all, but several of the options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3282.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was an attempt to just simply consolidate numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3284.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can get a breakout for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3305.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. McLaughlin is here to give us a report of what has been done and what more is going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3311.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated earlier, the SOI is being reviewed by SBA on October 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3317.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a lot's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3320.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Here's an update as we stand right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4065.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4066.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer some of that a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4069.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I told you, we have the SOI coming in on October 5th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4073.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we're going to get state money,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4076.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where we're going to do it with, because I want 56% on the dollar back if I can get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4083.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4084.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll be part of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4086.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If that's not possible, that becomes an object.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4088.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a number of other projects that we would hope to get state money for if they approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4125.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4126.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4127.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the restaurant,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4131.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, it needs a little bit more work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4134.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was an ambitious timetable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4138.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one will ever accuse Heidi of being anything less than ambitious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4142.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that we need a little bit more time to do it right, to finish off some things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4147.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Equipment has to be hooked up a certain way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4150.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there needs to be some training time for the people who are going to be using the materials so that we don't just simply say we open up today that we can put everything on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4161.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We suspect in early October that we'll be able to do something with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4232.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call on our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine Patterson, to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5899.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5902.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, we want youngsters to go to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5905.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not against our young people coming to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5908.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's obvious that we don't want to bar kids from school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5912.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have, despite of what you've heard, and I'll refer to our attorney in a moment, we have a court order that has not been rescinded by the Essex court and Essex probate court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5924.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to read the plain language of what it says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5927.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was issued on May 18th, and I have nothing that contradicts it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5932.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've asked repeatedly, if you've got something that contradicts it, I'll honor it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5936.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't have anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5938.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm not going to be in contempt of court for myself or for the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5942.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It says, at review of judgment of modification memorandum of decision dated March 30th, that's what they're referring to, 2017, the plaintiff's motion dated April 10th, 2017, the court enters the following order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5956.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5957.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plaintiff's request for an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools is denied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5967.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, I can't argue with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5969.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't argue with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5974.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have an attorney here who spoke to Lisa Greenberg, your attorney, today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5979.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So maybe Mr. Greenspan can come up and clarify what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6244.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, if I can, if I can, let me try and go through the sequence that I'm faced in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6252.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand everybody is sympathetic to children being in school, and so am I, even though it doesn't seem that way to the parents right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6260.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that on March 30th, there was a hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6264.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then Lisa Greenberg, who represents Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6268.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Knowles, made a request to the court<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6273.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and you have it in your packet, as to where the children should attend school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6277.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm going to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6278.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In denying the plaintiff's request to sole legal custody regarding education decisions, the court has made no decision nor given either party, either party, the right to enroll the children in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6291.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if either party does not have the right to enroll them in school, who does?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6295.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you go on to the next letter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6299.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which says, by the way, it says this only can result in contempt to be filed by one of the parties against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6306.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the next document that we have denies their request for an order to enroll them in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6316.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, it's between them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6318.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now why the court has not acted and intervened and made a decision, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6325.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is my problem because I represent a city and I cannot be in contempt of court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6331.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6332.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6333.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry I have a legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6334.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's your opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6364.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because there's nothing in their- Because there's no forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6372.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, they don't have the same, if you read the thing, they don't say you can't enroll them in the North Andover public schools, it says the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6380.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't say they can't enroll them in the Medford public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6387.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm referring to my legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6390.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not a lawyer, so I'll refer to my legal counsel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6392.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I'm going to take that as advice to me, not to place myself or the school committee in contempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6399.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I am very.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6412.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, I'm waiting for a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6415.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I called the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6423.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I called the court and asked the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6427.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I called the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6428.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We asked the people to go over the records and interpret it for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6432.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They told me that my interpretation was correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6435.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've asked my legal counsel to tell me what is my interpretation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6439.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He tells me I'm doing the right thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6441.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you can get the court to act, or you can agree with your ex-partner on where the child is going to school, we will expedite that enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6451.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will even give you compensatory services, because I think it would be in the best interest of the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6457.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I certainly can't, in this point, given what I know, act on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6640.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Greenspan, let me ask you one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6643.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it acceptable protocol for us to petition a judge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6847.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not 100% sure, but if we take jurisdiction of the children and approve a homeschooling plan, it's tantamount to doing the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6856.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, and I'm just using my logic, which may or may not be 100% correct, I have to admit that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6864.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm using my logic to say that what the judge wants to have happen is the parties to agree on something so there won't be an ongoing conflict between the parents, which may affect the child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6876.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And apparently that hasn't happened for whatever reason, and I'm not going to weigh in on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6882.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we're in a situation right now where we need a decision, and we don't have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6915.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's one other piece that I'll introduce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6917.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6919.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Knowles has filed a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6921.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: complaint with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6925.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I saw that today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6926.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I put a phone call into them asking them for some guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6931.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe they can intercede with the court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6934.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6935.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I put a phone call into them asking them for guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6940.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have another piece of information in your folder about when we talked about the B-1, B-2 visa situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6946.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And finally the AG, and finally the DESE ruled on something and told us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6951.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what they prefer, even though it was ambiguous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6954.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I got a phone call from Rhoda Schneider, who is the general legal counsel from the state, saying thank you for asking that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6961.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because there are things, there are gray areas that we're caught in the middle of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6966.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm sure it's going to get even grayer as we deal with DACA and other considerations in the weeks and months ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6973.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would love to enroll the children if it's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6976.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have no reason not to want to educate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6979.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're two young children that we want to help families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6981.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have no reason not to want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6983.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6984.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have any animus toward you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6986.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I do have paper in front of me that leads me to believe I'm not allowed to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6991.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I would like it resolved as much as you would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7019.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We call on our assistant superintendent to make this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7192.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll call upon our deputy superintendent to address this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9067.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to call on our Director of Administration and Finance to explain this revision mandated by the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9442.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report is a comprehensive report on how school brain software is implemented in the Medford School District during this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9451.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 2016-2017 first full year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9455.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We converted from the I-pass system, which was the system we used for multiple years, to school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9462.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was a major undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9464.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's still reasonable to expect that some bumps will be in the road as you make that kind of conversion, especially since there's many more complex elements to school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9474.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's much more that the state expects us to keep track of than ever before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9481.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The interaction between a management software package and the myriad of longstanding specific policies and practices doesn't get untangled overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9490.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the school brain software system has been a major improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9495.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Based upon our experience during year one, we are making adjustments that will address the issues that emerged in year one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9502.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there'll be certain policy decisions that we will have to make to avoid other concerns going forward, and I listed some for our consideration going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9511.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should a weighted GPA system be continued in any format?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9514.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of places have discontinued it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9517.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should special awards for achievement be based upon GPA-related ranking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9522.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or are there other ways to make these determinations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9525.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we allow optimum access to student records and still provide optimum privacy and security?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9531.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because the more people that can use the records for good purpose also opens up the door for what they know about individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9540.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How can we promote advanced student learning that is not driven by GPA style ranking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9545.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other things, I referenced it in my opening remarks, that we want our young people to be able to do, and the GPA doesn't necessarily reflect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9554.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And how can we systematically increase parental participation in the communication opportunities offered by school brains?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9560.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's not easy to get people to use a new system, which can be a little bit daunting at times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9567.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But nevertheless, that's what happens when it gets complex, and there are a lot of things you can do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9572.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to try to address many of these questions in the next few months as we seek to effectively assess student learning and properly value their achievements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9580.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the report that's attached was generated primarily by Curtis Tootin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9586.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Curtis, are you in the room?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9590.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9590.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In conjunction with myself and other members of the administration to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9597.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: give you some in-depth understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and some of the issues associated with school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9603.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of data here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9605.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to have Curtis go through some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9609.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't want to dwell on every item tonight because I think it's too long and too much in depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9614.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want you to get an idea of some of the strengths and some of the things we have to work on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9619.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the headmaster is here also to give you some feedback as to these types of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9625.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So go ahead, Curtis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10242.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's important to everyone understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10245.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are in an age where there are so many data points that are now being collected, and so much information that has to be cross-validated between student information, teacher licensure, course selection, student discipline, across the board, and it's all getting reported in, and it's cross-validating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10264.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as a result, the need to be precise has been exponentially created, so therefore,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10274.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there's a lot of learning to go on as people want more and more data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10279.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it takes a period of time for everyone to get used to it and also to be diligent about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10285.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't go into it and say, Oh, well, three weeks ago I should have made that change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10289.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to do it when it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10291.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a process in the long run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10294.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll work out in the short run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10296.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be a few bumps in the road and there'll be a few situations where some people aren't as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10301.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: diligent or as good at doing it, but we'll continue to stay on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10551.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when we negotiated the last contract, this was one of the items that was specified in the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10559.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the teachers obviously indicated that they didn't want to be putting stuff in every day and so on and so forth in different levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10568.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, the elementary school didn't really apply as much, with much more broad based information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10574.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the middle and high school, probably once a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10578.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every couple weeks that they would update that material, that was sort of the way they were thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10583.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And towards the end of the quarter again, there would be some of the drop off from that because they were concentrating on consolidating the grades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10591.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'll do some talking to some teachers and get a sense and get you another report because I think it's something that's going to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10598.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because people will use so many different systems for so long, they're comfortable with those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10603.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And now they're switching to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10605.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've also got to get parents to really use it because you can't motivate someone to use something if no one is looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10612.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to find a way to bring them both together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10615.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's sort of where we're coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10617.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But overall, it's the right direction to head in, albeit it's not a perfect system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3611.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, the Medford School Committee approved an appropriated budget of $56,431,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3620.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: buttressed by revenue of $2,071,107 of generated revenue, grants and other sources of revenue as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3628.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a 3.65 increase over last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3632.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the budget increases a number of activities which are positive for the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3638.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to increase our vocational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3641.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're bringing in revenue from the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3643.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're now up to 20 programs as opposed to 11 a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3648.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vocational school is really moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3650.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a number of ADA improvements that will meet all compliance requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3655.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A grant from the Commonwealth, there was a half a million dollar grant from the Commonwealth as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3660.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Technology has been increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3662.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've assigned probably 50 to 60 Chromebooks to each new school, each school rather, to increase their technology capability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3672.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've increased our E-rate funding to support infrastructure improvements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3678.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're increasing our nursing staff to improve health services as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3683.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a grant from the Commonwealth on opiate education through our Michigan model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3688.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're adding two additional ELL students, ELL teachers rather, that will help to meet the needs of youngsters who do not speak English as a first language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3699.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're adding, our class size is really very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3702.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no class in the elementary schools above 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3707.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, they're all below 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3709.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For those who are interested, we added a fifth, fourth grade at the Roberts through interest that people had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3720.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3725.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are adding additional money into the maintenance account so that every school will have additional dollars for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3730.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's $200,000 of additional maintenance money with each school getting a grant, direct grant of $20,000 in addition to general maintenance costs that we will carry through the central office that will allow them to attack certain issues that they feel are important to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3746.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The middle schools and the high school will get additional dollars for student activity stipends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3751.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The special education program will need some additional money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3755.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: tuition and transportation, but that's covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3760.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that we were able to reduce enrollment at Minuteman, which saves hundreds of thousands of dollars and increase our additional revenue from that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3844.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's been a very good budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=3846.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have to thank my staff, all the people that are working with us for the work that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4134.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have security during the day and we think that we've enhanced that quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4158.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The building is 550,000 square feet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4161.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a single individual moving around, I don't believe, is a particularly effective tool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4168.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a lot of adult personnel there, custodians, cleaning crew, coaches, advisors, teachers, and others, all of whom have been equipped with communication devices from time to time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4181.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, I understand what you're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4183.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the spirit of trying to come to some sort of agreement, let me bring it to the attention of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4190.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if the school committee believes that we should add a person who is in that particular assignment, then we'll bring that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4198.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I will actively bring it to their attention and we'll talk about that and give you a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zSHhVpiqwJA&t=4204.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's a reasonable compromise given the fact that we've gone back and forth on this for a few years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4014.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're adding, our class size is really very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4018.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no class in the elementary schools above 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4023.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, they're all below 22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4025.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For those who are interested, we added a fifth, fourth grade at the Roberts through interest that people had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4045.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's $200,000 of additional maintenance money with each school getting a direct grant of $20,000 in addition to general maintenance costs that we will carry through the central office that will allow them to attack certain issues that they feel are important to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/D3kEu2_5mwc&t=4076.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that we were able to reduce enrollment at Minuteman, which saves hundreds of thousands of dollars and increase our additional revenue from that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3237.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Congratulations, Joseph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3397.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, as you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3405.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3409.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3418.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up, because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3427.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration, working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3437.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the secret to success in almost anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3439.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3444.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3447.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've collaborated with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3448.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3449.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3451.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3459.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3541.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so undoubtedly, this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3584.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3622.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In relation to that I was just wondering if we sold any of the pieces as well Saturday we actually everything was sold at auction and I believe that Free discount free, you know the auctioneer's price which is 10% that they brought in about $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3638.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3641.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a report on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3642.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happening this Saturday, so I need a little more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3660.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Trying to, where is this again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3677.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just have to look that up when I get back to the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3684.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3688.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, I'll have to look that up when I get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3725.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam members of the committee, this is the committee of the whole that we held last Wednesday on the school councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3731.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3732.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rather than read it in totality,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3736.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If anyone has any particular questions, there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter into the record with your approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3863.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3865.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The parents participated in the council development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3870.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening was dependent on the school itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3877.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and several parents were there and were introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3880.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school did not have anyone there specifically, except one member who's actually a member of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3886.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But other than that, each school did introduce people, and there are like seven members on a council, so it isn't like there's 50 people on a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3902.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3903.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3908.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, theoretically, the report reflects them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3912.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3915.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: especially parents and community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3923.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4048.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4053.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4075.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We call upon our director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4080.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4964.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6263.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6273.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6280.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the discussions that we had was how can we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6284.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: spread them out, redistribute them a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6286.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades 1 and 2 at one school and 3, 4, and 5 at another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6296.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades 1 and 2 to the Brooks School for two reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6306.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6312.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, it will create more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6314.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of a balance between the two schools because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6321.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially and that will be helpful as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6330.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's our goal, that's what we're doing and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6396.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6400.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6404.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't make everybody happy all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6407.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6414.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now this year we'll do it with the elementary, but as we go into next year we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students because otherwise one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6427.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6433.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people ask for certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6436.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do our best to accommodate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6438.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time, we have to make a decision, and not everybody's going to be happy with that decision, but that's the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6447.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes in transition, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation, but we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6500.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6508.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and start to let them know what our plans are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6510.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we do have after school programs and other things like that that we can work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6519.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6531.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from time to time, you make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6534.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You do it in the vast majority of people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6537.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6546.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully by third grade they're no longer a newcomer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6549.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6554.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6555.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would go back to their school of origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6557.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6560.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple years should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6562.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6565.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could go back to the School of Archer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6585.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, just a couple of announcements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6617.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6626.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I just wanted to say what I wanted to see was just how attentive you are to what I send out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6632.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6635.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rest of you just weren't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6636.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I'm just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6638.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've given you corrected dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6640.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 1130 at the Irish American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6646.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11, now 11 o'clock?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6647.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6653.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6656.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was looking at, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6659.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6659.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you get there half an hour later, you'll be there in time for the food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6662.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6664.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The M Club banquet is on June 6th in the evening and graduation is on the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6670.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6671.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6677.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6682.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6685.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's Wednesday starting at 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6689.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations, and also possibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6698.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6703.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm still going through applications, talking to references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6705.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6718.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6719.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll know that better in the next week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6724.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to that, I think that you should know that the Senate is coming out with its Ways and Means budget tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6732.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That gives us a better idea of what the Senate is proposing versus what the House is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6741.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around when reports from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6747.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all those things have an impact on you, and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6759.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't say that word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3181.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maria Gailback, Outstanding Performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3338.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Congratulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3341.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dear members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, as you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3349.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3353.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3362.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3367.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3371.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3376.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3381.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the secret to success in almost anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3384.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3388.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3391.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've collaborated with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3392.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3393.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3395.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3403.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3486.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so undoubtedly this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3528.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3571.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On Saturday, we actually, everything was sold at auction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3574.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that, um, pre discount pre, you know, the auctioneer's price, which is 10% that they brought in about $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3582.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3586.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happened on the Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3587.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need a little more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3604.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Trying to, where is this again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3621.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just have to look that up when we get back to the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3628.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3657.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the committee, this is the Committee of the Whole that we held last Wednesday on the school councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3663.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3664.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rather than read it in totality, if anyone has any particular questions, if there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter it into the record with your approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3795.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3797.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The parents participated in the council development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3802.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3807.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: was dependent on the school itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3809.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And several parents were there and were introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3812.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, one school did not have anyone there specifically except one member who's actually a member of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3817.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3818.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But other than that, each school did introduce people and there are like seven members on a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3823.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it isn't like this, like there's 50 people on a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3834.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3835.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3840.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, theoretically the report reflects them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3844.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3847.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are strictly parents and community members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3980.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=3985.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=4007.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We call upon our Director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=4895.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 2017 Mr. Superintendent call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6196.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6205.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6212.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the discussions that we had was how can we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6216.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: spread them out, redistribute them a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6218.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades one and two at one school, and three, four, and five at another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6228.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades one and two to the Brooks School for two reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6238.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6244.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, it will create more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6246.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of a balance between the two schools, because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6253.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population, and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially, and that will be helpful as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6262.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's our goal, that's what we're doing, and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6328.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6332.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6336.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't make everybody happy all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6339.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6346.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now this year we'll do it with the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6348.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6354.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because otherwise, one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6359.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6365.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people ask for certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6368.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do our best to accommodate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6370.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time, we have to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6373.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And not everybody's going to be happy with that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6375.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6380.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes in transition, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6387.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6432.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week and start to let them know that what our plans are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6443.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we do have after school programs and other things like that we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6447.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6451.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6457.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6463.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from time to time, you make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6466.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You do it in the vast majority of people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6468.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6478.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully by third grade, they're no longer a newcomer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6481.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6486.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6487.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would go back to their school of origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6489.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6492.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of years should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6494.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6497.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could go back to school of origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6517.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are just a couple of announcements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6549.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6558.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what I wanted to see was just how attentive you are to what I send out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6564.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6567.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rest of you just weren't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6568.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I'm just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6570.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've given you corrected dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6573.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 11.30 at the Irish American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6579.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now 11 o'clock?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6579.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6585.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6590.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6591.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you get there half an hour later you'll be there in time for the food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6596.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The M-Corp banquet is on June 6th in the evening and graduation is on the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6603.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6609.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6614.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6617.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's Wednesday starting at seven.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6621.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations and also possibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6631.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6635.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm still going through applications, talking to references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6638.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6650.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6651.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll know that better in the next week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6656.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to that, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6659.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should know that the Senate is coming out with its ways and means budget tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6664.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That gives us a better idea of what the Senate is proposing versus what the house is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6673.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around, uh, when reports from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6679.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all those things have an impact on you and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2j8KjuogAZY&t=6691.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't say that word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2852.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2856.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2860.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2864.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2873.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up, because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2882.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2887.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2892.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the secret to success in almost anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2895.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2899.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2902.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've collaborated with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2903.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2904.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've collaborated with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2906.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2914.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=2997.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so undoubtedly, this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3039.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3082.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On Saturday, we actually, everything was sold at auction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3086.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that pre-discount, pre, you know, the auctioneer's price, which is 10%, that they brought in about $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3093.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3095.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a report on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3097.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happened on this Saturday, so we need a little more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3115.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Trying to, where is this again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3132.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just have to look that up when I get back to the office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3139.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3143.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll have to look that up when I get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3191.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If anyone has any particular questions, if there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter into the record with your approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3318.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just would comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3320.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The parents participated in the council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3324.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: development, the attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening was dependent on the school itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3332.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And several parents were there and were introduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3336.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One school did not have anyone there specifically, except one member who was actually a member of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3341.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But other than that, each school did introduce people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3344.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are like seven members on a council, so it isn't like there's 50 people on a council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3351.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying and certainly will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3356.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's probably in the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3357.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3358.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council, so, you know, theoretically the report reflects them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3367.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3502.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3508.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=3530.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll call upon our Director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=4419.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5719.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5728.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5736.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the discussions that we had was how can we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5739.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: spread them out and redistribute them a little bit more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5741.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades 1 and 2 at one school and 3, 4, and 5 at another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5751.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades 1 and 2 to the Brooks School for two reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5762.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5767.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, it will create more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5769.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of a balance between the two schools, because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5776.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population, and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially, and that will be helpful as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5785.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's our goal, that's what we're doing, and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5851.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5855.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5859.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't make everybody happy all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5862.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5869.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now this year we'll do it with the elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5871.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5877.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because otherwise, one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5883.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5889.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So people ask for certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5891.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do our best to accommodate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5893.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From time to time, we have to make a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5896.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And not everybody's going to be happy with that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5899.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5902.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, and sometimes in transition, uh, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation, but we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5955.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week and start to let them know what our plans are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5966.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we do have after school programs and other things like that that we can work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5975.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want, because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=5987.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So from time to time, you make a decision, you do it in the vast majority of people involved, and you try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6000.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In third grade, if they're, hopefully by third grade, they're no longer a newcomer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6004.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6009.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6010.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would go back to their school of origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6012.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6015.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of years should do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6017.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6021.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could go back to school of origin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6072.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6081.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what I wanted to see was just how, you know, attentive you are to what I send out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6087.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6090.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rest of you just weren't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6091.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I'm just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6093.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've given you corrected dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6096.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 1130 at the Irish American.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6102.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now 11 o'clock?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6102.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6108.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6112.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you get there half an hour later, you'll be there in time for the food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6119.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The M-Corp banquet is on June 6th in the evening, and graduation is on the 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6126.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6132.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6137.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6140.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's Wednesday starting at 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6144.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations, and also possibly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6154.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6158.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm still going through applications, talking to references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6161.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6173.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll see that and we'll know that better in the next week or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6179.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to that, I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6182.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you should know that the senate is coming out with its ways and means budget tomorrow that gives us a better idea of what the senate is proposing versus what the house is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6196.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around in reports from the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/w0sagWRQcPk&t=6203.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all those things have an impact on you and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=861.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=867.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=874.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got the information in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=877.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=885.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: available to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=893.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was put together into a scholarship program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=897.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Amelia Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=906.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The details are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=912.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: rather than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1177.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Making a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1183.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1569.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think we all realize that the opiate issue is becoming very, very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1576.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1577.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts amount of opiate exceeds the national average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1582.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for opiate deaths and the like, and it affects marriages, it affects jobs, families, neighborhoods, and all kinds of things out there that are not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1593.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So through the work of Tony and Rachel, we have another grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1599.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll let them explain it because I think it's a really good item for us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1995.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The word fun is not really a good way to begin the word funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2003.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there'll be several.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2005.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor was doing- They're starting to emerge right now, because I think the biggest thing you have to understand is a lot of things coming out, but they're always underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2013.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, so there's a few dollars put to them, but then there's not enough to really carry them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2017.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see some of the budget report that we're going to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2295.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a standard schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2355.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the expanded use of technology in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2357.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what you have is, I think, a very thorough report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2361.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It gives us some pathways to pursue and strengthen our capacities to use technology efficiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2368.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also enables us to access our tier two funding in support of upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2374.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These reports, as I mentioned, are very technical and extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2378.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're provided to you so that you can take your time to go through them and perhaps develop a deeper understanding of the complexity<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2385.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we'll take to integrate technology into our programs in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2391.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The recommendation provides several key steps that we can take without a burdensome cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2396.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these things are just doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2398.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2400.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it still is important for us to recognize that there are heavy requirements of testing, state reporting, electronic data management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2407.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Communication requires we have finely tuned, robust, and reliable capacity to meet our obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2412.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, well, it's not part of this report, some staffing that has to be done so that we can maintain these systems the way we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2421.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a one-time thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2423.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2424.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll be with us for a while in terms of the infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2428.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be many upgrades that'll always be required as more things are added and more people are trying to do things and more devices are played with, but this is a very, very good investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2440.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend, first of all, that you would read the executive summaries because that gives you enough of a background to understand what's being involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2448.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, you'll find some materials that talk about the category two E-rate funding estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2455.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And under this program, we can access $398,100 of federal funds with a $265,000, $400 match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2465.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're currently soliciting bids and completing E-rate applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2469.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will seek capital funding to meet this infrastructure need in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2476.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clear that other things need to be done in terms of devices and equipment, but that's not part of this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2485.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't do it this year, I have a feeling some of this stuff may not be available to school systems or libraries next year because of some of the domestic cutbacks that are being considered in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2497.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like to act on this now, and I'd like to let you know that we're working actively on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2504.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kirstine is working closely on the financial part and on the technical part as well with Steve Kelly of TechEdge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2512.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I look forward to moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2515.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2517.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Kirstine's here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2556.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can do that if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2557.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2558.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly want to move forward because we want to be able to file our applications and take advantage of bids that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2565.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you want to come into the hall, we can schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2567.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are going to have a very busy schedule in the month of May and early June because of a number of things, including school council reports and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2575.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But happy to schedule it if this is what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2655.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what our plans are internally because we're still refining them somewhat because we still have to figure out how much money is available to us operationally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2662.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we will plan to buy devices with the regular budget in addition to some of the other, you know, things we've typically done because in order to use the network, you have to have more devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2674.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And probably a lot of Chromebooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2675.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see this in the school council reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2679.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are asking for these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2681.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need them for testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2681.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need them for reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2682.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few other devices we will need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2685.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the infrastructure is something that we can bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2688.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the infrastructure is something that we can get E-rate money for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2691.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we need to really go after right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2694.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's money that we wouldn't typically put in an operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2699.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So yes, you'll see substantial dollars put to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2703.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plus, there's also some staff needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2705.224s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're going to have to try and put that in place and work that around as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2722.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2722.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That is not our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2723.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, did you want to come up and comment on any of these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2726.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it's financial stuff that she's working closely with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2895.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, let's go over this now, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2897.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government, we put this report in, we put an E-rate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2901.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, a funding request in every year, the general E-rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2903.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is Tier 2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2904.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tier 1, we generally get $50,000 to $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2906.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed a little bit because of the change from telecommunications to other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2911.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We generally, that's independent of this, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2914.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tier 2 is a special infrastructure type funding that's designed to give us more robust capability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2922.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll put this in on May 11th, and then we've got to wait for the federal government to actually formally approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2929.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we don't put it in on May 11th, and we don't put this in, we won't be eligible to ask for the money later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2937.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the actual spending process will take place after we have more of a discussion on the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2976.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just want to get an authorization to move forward if you can because you know otherwise what you lose the opportunity to access it and I'm willing to bet, not willing to bet, but I think it's a pretty good bet that this funding will start to disappear with the next federal budget and I think if we don't you know act we won't have this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3030.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3031.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3033.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3033.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some places will be more technologically involved than other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3043.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: McGlynn is two schools in one, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3051.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3052.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, some places use technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3112.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, we're talking about a snapshot in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3115.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about an attempt to find out the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3117.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: capacity of the network to handle traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3120.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, it was done on a few days here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3122.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be done every day because obviously we'd be paying, you know, a lot of money for a study that would happen every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3129.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it just happens this is what's coming through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3131.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives us an idea of what<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3133.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Traffic would look like on maybe a normal day, but maybe it doesn't totally reflect everyday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3253.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, John, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3256.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now appearing on our stage, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3263.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, buildings and grounds obviously is a big area for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3270.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have a lot of interest in this, and I just want to comment before John talks about his specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3276.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as I told you in a prior meeting, that it's my intent to augment the building repair line by 200,000, which would then be distributed among the schools for the various projects that we've all been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3290.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because quite frankly, the budget that we have will get used up for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3295.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: general maintenance and it will be used up for things that go boom in the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3302.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this would give us some flexibility in doing some of the repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3307.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now the major piece for the high school, we want to see where the SOI takes us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3313.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some other aspects of the high school, which John will address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3316.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the SOI is what we submitted to the MSBA and see where that goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3321.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously, if we get money from them, that's going to be a lot bigger amount than we would be able to fund ourselves internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3329.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot going on, but I wanted to have a chance to take a look at some of the things moving through this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3334.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And John, do you have your copy of your report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3336.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3337.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't you talk a little bit about what's in your report, and I'll be happy to augment it as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3351.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The $200,000 that you're adding to the budget this year, is that going to be annually from this point on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3355.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3356.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we have to sit down and have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3359.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I think that that particular line item should grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3361.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whether it should grow $200,000, $300,000, or $150,000 is something we can look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3364.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also depends to some degree on what else we can get funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3369.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the concept is to put a few more dollars in this thing so we can address very specific topics that you have an interest in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3377.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh... and we can do it with assurance rather than have to wait to see how many things go bum in the night uh... you know which we have to deal with emergency funding uh... like we did get a couple of pipes this year and the year before and so on and so forth so it would give us more flexibility but how much it really depends on you know the projects we identify and where we go with it Mr. McLaughlin Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Dawson, committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4118.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever it is, you'll get a chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4121.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4448.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4453.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a good opportunity for me to wrap a few things together and also talk about some of the things that just came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4461.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed its initial version of the FY 2018 state budget last Tuesday, April 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4472.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House version will now go to the State Senate for their deliberations, ways and means, and then the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4480.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we would expect the Senate version to emerge sometime in late May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4485.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there will be differences between the two legislative bodies, there will be a joint conference committee consisting of three members from each chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4493.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll try to reconcile their differences and then go to the full body in each chamber to get an up or down vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4500.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can't make changes once it comes out of conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4505.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the changes, once it comes out from the full legislature, will go to the governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4509.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor undoubtedly will veto some line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4512.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The legislature historically will override most of his vetoes, give or take a few here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4519.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the state budget should be completed sometime by the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4524.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, we have to start doing our budgets well in advance of that, so we start to look at what the House and the Senate will do, because typically there are pretty good guidelines as to what will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4538.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4540.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate tends to be a little bit more financially generous than the House, although items vary from area to area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4547.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the first time, the initial budget from the House exceeds $40 billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4554.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's actually less than what the Governor proposed, slightly, but it still exceeds $40 billion to support the various line items and any new programs and services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4565.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But most of the new money goes to mass health, pensions, and a modest increase in local aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4576.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4577.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4577.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go into some of that in a way, but 40% of the budget typically or more right now is mass health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4586.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives you an idea of, you know, it may be $40 billion, but so much of it is eaten up by certain entitlements that, uh, there isn't a lot of discretionary funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4595.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the main limitation on the budget is the availability of money, uh, to support the various line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4604.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: any new programs and services, just like we're talking about right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4607.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much money is going to be available to do all the things that you think should be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4612.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the new money, as I say, goes for certain items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4616.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During FY 2016, the state found the budget was initially short $455 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4624.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, revenue at the end of March is running $220 million below estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4632.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: April receipt should be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4634.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: April is usually a very good month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4635.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The beginning of the month was good, but until we get the final figures, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4641.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But typically, we should be able to close a good portion of that gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4645.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But closing that gap doesn't give us any surplus, doesn't give any excess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4648.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just gives us a gap close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4651.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no guarantee that, you know, how much money will come in actually in June, in May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4658.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4659.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The projection for this year was a 3.1% growth factor at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4665.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And through March, it's 1.7%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4665.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gives you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4669.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's nationally, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4670.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A 2% growth is sort of like, you know, a hallmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4674.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A study by the Federal Reserve explained that while Massachusetts unemployment was down, there was a significant drop in wages and hours worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4684.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that means that the overall personal income was lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4689.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Spending was higher, most notably in the health sector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4693.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, a sales tax on merchandise was affected by increased online buying, for which there is no tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4700.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, it's impossible that the income tax rate will drop again because of the automatic trigger built into the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4707.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The drop in the income tax cost the Commonwealth more of a billion dollars a year since that trigger was put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4717.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There appears to be no appetite for increased taxation, although there may be some proposal out of the Senate, as Senate President Rosenberg seems to put this forward a little bit, although tax proposals have to emanate from the House first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4734.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lastly, we can expect some cutbacks from Washington on domestic spending, including various education items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4742.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the following items are things to think about in the House budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4745.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, they haven't printed the whole House budget, so I can't get every nickel and dime figured out 100%, but I've gone behind the numbers as much as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4753.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 70 is $30 per pupil in the House budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4758.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was $55 per pupil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4761.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor is proposing $20 per pupil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4765.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's approximately $145,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4768.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unrestricted municipal aid is up statewide by 40 million, but when it's distributed, it isn't that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4775.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The special education circuit breaker was level funded in the House budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4780.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be short somewhere between 10 and 15 million dollars for full funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4785.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as more students qualify, there's a greater demand on this account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4791.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're projecting less funding in fiscal 2017 than we were in there in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4796.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already given you some of those numbers in the last financial report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4800.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there could be a further reduction in fiscal 2018, and that's for extraordinary special ed costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4805.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have to pay attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4807.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charter school funding is level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4810.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect the statewide entitlement to be $60 million below need, maybe more, depending on how much expansion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4816.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Depending on the number of students who opt for charter schools, we could see an increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4821.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in our local cost, although I think we've leveled pretty well and we're bringing people back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4828.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also know that Washington is very heavy on pro-choice with Secretary DeVos, and we'll see what comes out of there for choice issues in support of charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4839.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Homeless transportation is level funded, 50% of what we think entitlement would be, if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4847.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No funding, new funding came back for kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4850.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We lost $143,000 last year and there's nothing in that line item this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4856.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Out of district, non-resident transportation is cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4860.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could lose about $30,000 in that particular line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4864.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no new funding for technology that we've seen outside of what I presented this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4869.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be able to get some significant federal dollars as I explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4873.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Department of Public Health funding should be reasonably stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4876.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That funds a nurse and some of the work that's done on health prevention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4881.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Early childhood funding through the grant account is expected to lose 30% of current level as priorities shift from programs to workforce development support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4892.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In other words, increasing the salaries of people in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4896.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: non-profit sector and providing additional training for them because they're well underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4901.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's certainly a worthy priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4903.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, they didn't say we'll do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4905.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They said we'll take the money from the programs and move it over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4909.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit more there, but it's not clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4912.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just got through talking a little bit about maintenance and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4918.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a finite pot of gold out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4921.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you just can't say we'll just do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4925.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll try to provide you with options across the board so you can select, and hopefully we'll continue to search out new sources of funding like we have with the vocational school and other things and opiate prevention to augment what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4938.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the general distributions coming from the state place a tremendous burden on the locality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4945.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost of health care keeps going up, and we just don't know, you know, where it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4950.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't know what Washington's going to do and what's going to happen to that situation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4955.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It goes back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4956.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are a lot of other factors that have to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4960.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we also have to carry at least a 2.5% increase in salary negotiations, which isn't outrageous, but it's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4972.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you also have step increases that people who are starting the young teachers move up the steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4978.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's on top of the 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4979.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4982.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be easy for me to get up and say, sure, tell me whatever you want me to fix, tell me whatever you want me to do, go add this, add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4988.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not that simple and you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4990.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, what it is is that we have to lay it all out and decide what's most important to us and move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4997.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a lot of great things going on in this community and a lot of great things going on in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5001.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should be very proud of the work you've done, very proud of the administration and City Hall supporting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5008.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there will be some limitations, and we'll have to make some tough choices, forced choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5012.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the budget process is beginning at the Statehouse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5016.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep watching the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5017.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go up and lobby, you know, for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5020.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk to people about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5021.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll look for additional grants, look for additional revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5024.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've recaptured some revenue through the Minuteman activity, the revenue coming in through the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5031.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But still, it's got to be spread out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5034.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the state budget so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5037.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted, and we'll keep talking budget as we go forward and try to set priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5051.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, that's the Minuteman bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5052.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5053.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in another year from now, we won't have a bus going to Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5059.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to try and get a smaller vehicle, which may cost less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5062.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if I lose the reimbursement for non-resident last year, two years ago, it was almost $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5068.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then it went down to half of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5070.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year in the house budget, it's $250,000 for that line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5076.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, there's about 16 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5078.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next year, I would expect eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5084.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, hey, listen, if you can't go one way, we'll must own the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5088.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5089.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5090.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5091.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5091.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5092.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5171.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, it's definitely an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5173.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just so you know, the Medicaid funding is generated by students who are eligible through disabilities and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5179.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5181.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Short Collaborative is our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5183.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: broker, if you will, it comes back through it, but it goes into the city treasury, and as the mayor points out, it adds to the total pie that's then available for redistribution to the schools, to the city, and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5193.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's factored into the overall who gets what kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5197.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some people that say they want it to come to them, but quite frankly, it's the same pot of gold, and we just simply work with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5203.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it could be $400,000, $500,000 that we could lose, and the state could lose that much more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5209.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because they're dependent on it as well, and that could drive the cost of health care right through the roof, which will also impact our employees, because they have to pay more for health insurance and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5219.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, that would bring them to the bargaining table, because next year, while we're covered for next year, bargaining for the successor contracts will start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5228.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as they lose money in terms of, you know, the health care costs and things of that type, they're going to be looking for something to make it up in salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5237.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All this stuff has triggers that, you know, have got to be thought about, planned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5242.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to understand what it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5244.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, when we commit something going forward, we've got to realize it might have ripple effect multiple years down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5251.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just, you know, any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5252.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's that year, maybe, but then there's more going on down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5257.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it stands now, we're, you know, we're using a lot of generated revenue to support our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5265.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At some point in time, that generated revenue will hit a wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5268.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can only make so much at any given time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5271.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's all kinds of issues, but Washington, you know, is a real black hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5276.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You really don't know a lot of the programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5278.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Title II is 150,000 go into salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5282.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That could disappear, you know, for class size reduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5287.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other programs like that for supplies, materials, bilingual, EO money could come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5294.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you can see, our population is significantly growing in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5299.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the issue of, and I know it's unpopular, the millionaires' tax is out there someplace, whether that actually goes through in a year from now, certainly would be helpful to the revenue pie, but then again, if that money gets generated, who will get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5315.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the issue of any money generated through the marijuana bill, sales taxes, other things like that, all up in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5322.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a whole group out there that want to cut the sales tax, you know, want to bring it back down again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5326.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of discussions that are going on right now, and, you know, we've got to balance it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5332.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I love it when people come up and say we need this and need that, and I really respect that, because they're advocating for what they want, and that you should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=5342.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then our job becomes how to balance it out, how to do as much as we can and fairly apportion it to the things that are important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=109.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, you have heard undoubtedly about the Connors Scholarship Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=114.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was created through the generosity of James and Thelma Connors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=121.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got the information in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=124.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People of modest means or apparently of modest means until the very end when their investments became<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=132.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: available to the city and through the work of Attorney John Granara, former Mayor Mike McGlynn, and Stephen Andrew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=140.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was put together into a scholarship program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=144.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Amelia Jensen is here, our Director of Guidance, and she is reaching out to students to apply for this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=153.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The details are here, and happy to answer any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=159.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: rather than go through it, but it's obviously a very generous activity and we're pleased to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=424.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Making a return appearance is Amelia Jensen to tell you about the college acceptances to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=430.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is still preliminary, but we wanted to give you a sense of what was happening out there for the time being.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=816.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think we all realize that the opiate issue is becoming very, very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=823.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has been very substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=824.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts amount of opiate exceeds the national aperture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=829.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for opiate deaths and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=831.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it affects marriages, it affects jobs, families, neighborhoods, and all kinds of things out there that are not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=840.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So through the work of Tony and Rachel, we have another grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=846.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll let them explain it because I think it's a really good item for us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1242.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The word fun is not really a good way to begin the word funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1250.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be several.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1253.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're starting to emerge right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1255.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I think the biggest thing you have to understand is a lot of things coming out, but they're always underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1260.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1261.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a few dollars put to them, but then there's not enough to really carry them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1264.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see some of the budget report that we're going to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1541.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1542.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a standard schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1592.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report we commissioned earlier this year to get us a robust look at our network and all the infrastructure that's necessary to support the expanded use of technology in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1604.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what you have is, I think, a very thorough report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1608.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It gives us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1610.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some pathways to pursue and strengthen our capacities to use technology efficiently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1615.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also enables us to access our tier two funding in support of upgrades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1621.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These reports, as I mentioned, are very technical and extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1625.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're provided to you so that you can take your time to go through them and perhaps develop a deeper understanding of the complexity it will take to integrate technology into our programs in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1638.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The recommendations provide several key steps that we can take without a burdensome cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1643.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of these things are just doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1645.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just have to do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1647.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And still, it's important for us to recognize that there are heavy requirements of testing, state reporting, electronic data management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1654.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Communication requires we have finely tuned, robust, and reliable capacity to meet our obligations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1659.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, well, it's not part of this report, some staffing that has to be done so that we can maintain these systems the way we need to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1668.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a one-time thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1670.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1671.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll be with us for a while in terms of the infrastructure, but there'll be many upgrades that will always be required as more things are added and more people are trying to do things and more devices are played with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1684.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is a very, very good investment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1687.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend, first of all, that you would read the executive summaries because that gives you enough of a background to understand what's being involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1695.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, you'll find some materials that talk about the category two E-rate funding estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1702.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And under this program, we can access $398,100 of federal funds with a $265,000, $400 match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1712.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're currently soliciting bids and completing E-rate applications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1716.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will seek capital funding to meet this infrastructure need in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1723.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clear that other things need to be done in terms of devices and equipment, but that's not part of this particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1732.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we don't do it this year, I have a feeling some of this stuff may not be available to school systems or libraries next year because of some of the domestic cutbacks that are being considered in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1744.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like to act on this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1746.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to let you know that we're working actively on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1751.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine is working closely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1754.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, on the financial part and on the technical part as well with Steve Kelly of tech edge and, uh, look forward to moving this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1762.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions and Christine's here as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1803.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we can do that if you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1804.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do we need to?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1805.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly, you know, want to move forward because, you know, we want to be able to file our applications and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1811.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and take advantage of bids that are out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1812.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you want to come into the hall, we can schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1814.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do are going to have a very busy schedule in the month of May and early June because of a number of things, including school council reports and the like, but happy to schedule it if this is what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1840.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1900.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what our plans are internally, of course, we're still refining them somewhat because we still have to figure out how much money is available to us operationally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1909.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we will plan to buy devices with a regular budget in addition to some of the other things we've typically done, because in order to use the network, you have to have more devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1921.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably a lot of Chromebooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1922.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see this in the school council reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1927.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are asking for these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1928.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need them for testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1929.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need them for reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1929.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a few other devices we will need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1932.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the infrastructure is something that we can bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1936.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the infrastructure is something that we can get E-rate money for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1938.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we need to really go after right now, because that's money that we wouldn't typically put in an operating budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1946.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So yes, you'll see substantial dollars<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1949.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: put to this, plus there's also some staff needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1952.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're going to have to try and put that in place and work that around as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1969.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1970.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, did you want to come up and comment on any of these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1973.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cause it's financial stuff that she's working closely with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2142.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, let's, let's go over this now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2144.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2144.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government, we put this report in, we put an E-rate, you know, a funding request in every year, the general E-rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2150.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is tier two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2152.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tier one, we generally get 50 to $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2153.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's changed a little bit because of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2156.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: change from telecommunications to other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2158.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But generally, that's independent of this, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2161.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tier 2 is a special infrastructure type funding that's designed to give us more robust capability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2169.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll put this in on May 11th, and then we've got to wait for the federal government to actually formally approve it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2176.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, if we don't put it in on May 11th, and we don't put this in, we won't be eligible to ask for the money later on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2184.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the actual spending<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2186.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: process will take place after we have a more, more of a discussion on the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2223.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just want to get an authorization to move forward if you can, because otherwise you lose the opportunity to access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2230.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm willing to bet, not willing to bet, but I think it's a pretty good bet that this funding will start to disappear with the next federal budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2238.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think if we don't act, we won't have this opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2277.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2279.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2280.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some places will be more technologically involved than other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2290.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: McGlynn is two schools in one, remember?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2298.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2299.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, some places use technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2359.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, we're talking about a snapshot in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2362.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're talking about an attempt to find out the capacity of the network to handle traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2367.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was done on a few days here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2370.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be done every day, because obviously we'd be paying a lot of money for a study that would happen every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2376.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it just happens this is what's coming through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2378.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives us an idea of what traffic would look like on maybe a normal day, but maybe it doesn't totally reflect every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2420.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2421.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can get some comment on that, and they'll follow me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2500.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, John, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2510.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, buildings and grounds obviously is a big area for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2517.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, um, you have a lot of interest in this and I just want to comment before John talks about his specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2523.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, uh, as I told you in a prior meeting that it's my intent to augment the building repair of mine by 200,000, which would then be distributed among the schools for the various projects that we've all been talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2537.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because quite frankly, the budget that we have will get used up for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2542.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: general maintenance and it will be used up for things that, you know, go boom in the night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2549.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this would give us some flexibility in doing some of the repairs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2554.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now the major piece for the high school, we want to see where the SOI takes us, you know, and there's some other aspects of the high school which John will address, but the SOI is what we submitted to the MSBA and see where that goes because obviously if we get money from them, you know, that's going to be a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2572.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a lot bigger amount than we would be able to fund ourselves internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2576.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot going on, but I wanted to have a chance to take a look at some of the things moving through this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2581.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And John, you have your copy of your report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2583.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2584.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't you talk a little bit about what's in your report and I'll be happy to augment it as we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2589.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Benedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2598.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2599.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we have to sit down and have that discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2601.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2602.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: particular line item should grow, whether it should grow $200,000, $300,000, or $150,000 is something we can look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2611.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also depends to some degree on what else we can get funding for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2616.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think the concept is to put a few more dollars in this thing so we can address very specific topics that you have an interest in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2624.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can do it with assurance rather than have to wait to see how many things go bum in the night, which we have to deal with emergency funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=2633.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like we did got a couple of pipes like this year and be here before and so on so forth So it would give us more flexibility, but how much that really depends on you know the projects we identify and where we go with it Mr. McLaughlin good evening mayor Burke superintendent Dawson committee so our district is 1.1 to 1.2 million square feet<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3365.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever it is, you'll get a chance to vote on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3368.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3695.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3700.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a good opportunity for me to wrap a few things together and also talk about some of the things that just came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3708.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts House of Representatives<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3711.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: passed its initial version of the FY 2018 state budget last Tuesday, April 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3719.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House version will now go to the State Senate for their deliberations, ways and means, and then the floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3727.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we would expect the Senate version to emerge sometime in late May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3732.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since there will be differences between the two legislative bodies, there will be a joint conference committee consisting of three members from each chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3741.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'll try to reconcile their differences and then go to the full body in each chamber to get an up or down vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3747.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can't make changes once it comes out of conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3752.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then the changes, once it comes out from the full legislature, will go to the governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3756.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor undoubtedly will veto some line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3759.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The legislature historically will override most of his vetoes, give or take a few here and there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3766.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the state budget should be completed sometime by the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3771.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, we have to start doing our budgets well in advance of that, so we start to look at what the House and the Senate will do, because typically there are pretty good guidelines as to what will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3785.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3787.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate tends to be a little bit more financially generous than the House, although items vary from area to area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3794.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the first time, the initial budget from the House exceeds $40 billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3801.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's actually less than what the governor proposed, slightly, but it still exceeds $40 billion to support the various line items and any new programs and services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3812.664s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But most of the new money goes to mass health, pensions, and a modest increase in local aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3823.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very limited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3824.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3824.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go into some of that in a way, but 40% of the budget typically or more right now is mass health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3833.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it gives you an idea of, you know, it may be $40 billion, but so much of it is eaten up by certain entitlements that, uh, there isn't a lot of discretionary funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3842.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the main limitation on the budget is the availability of money, uh, to support the various line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3851.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: any new programs and services, just like we're talking about right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3854.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much money is going to be available to do all the things that you think should be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3859.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the new money, as I say, goes for certain items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3863.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During FY 2016, the state found the budget was initially short $455 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3868.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, revenue, as the end of March, is running $220 million below estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3879.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: April receipt should be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3881.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: April is usually a very good month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3882.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The beginning of the month was good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3884.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But until we get the final figures, we don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3888.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But typically, we should be able to close a good portion of that gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3892.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But closing that gap doesn't give us any surplus, doesn't give any excess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3895.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just gives us a gap close.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3898.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no guarantee that how much money will come in, actually, in June, in May and June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3905.165s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Originally, the projection for this year was a 3.1%<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3909.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: growth factor at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3912.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And through March, it's 1.7%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3914.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gives you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3916.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's nationally, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3917.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 2% growth is sort of like, you know, a hallmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3921.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A study by the Federal Reserve explained that while Massachusetts unemployment was down, there was a significant drop in wages and hours worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3931.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that means that the overall personal income was lower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3936.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Spending was higher, most notably in the health sector.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3940.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, a sales tax on merchandise was affected by increased online buying, for which there is no tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3947.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furthermore, it's impossible that the income tax rate will drop again because of the automatic trigger built into the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3954.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The drop in the income tax cost the Commonwealth more of a billion dollars a year since that trigger was put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3964.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There appears to be no appetite for increased taxation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3969.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although there may be some proposal out of the Senate, as Senate President Rosenberg seems to put this forward a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3977.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although tax proposals have to emanate from the House first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3981.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lastly, we can expect some cutbacks from Washington on domestic spending, including various education items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3989.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the following items are things to think about in the house budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3992.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, they haven't printed the whole house budget, so I can't get every nickel and dime figured out a hundred percent, but I've gone behind the numbers as much as I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4000.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 70 is $30 per pupil in the house budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4005.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year it was $55 per pupil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4009.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's proposing $20 per pupil.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4012.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's approximately $145,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4015.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unrestricted municipal aid is up statewide by 40 million, but when it's distributed, it isn't that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4022.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The special education circuit breaker was level funded in the house budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4027.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be short somewhere between 10 and $15 million for full funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4032.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as more students qualify, there's a greater demand on this account.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4038.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're projecting less funding in fiscal 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4040.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in there in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4043.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already given you some of those numbers in the last financial report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4047.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there could be a further reduction in fiscal 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4049.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's for extraordinary special ed costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4052.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have to pay attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4054.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charter school funding is level funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4057.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect the statewide entitlement to be $60 million below need, maybe more, depending on how much expansion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4064.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Depending on the number of students who opt for charter schools, we could see an increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4068.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in our local cost, although I think we've leveled pretty well and we're bringing people back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4075.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we also know that Washington is very heavy on pro-choice with Secretary DeVos, and we'll see what comes out of there for the choice issues in support of charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4087.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Homeless transportation is level funded, 50% of what we think entitlement would be, if that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4094.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No funding, new funding came back for kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4097.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We lost $143,000 last year, and there's nothing in that line item this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4103.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Out of district, non-resident transportation is cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4107.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could lose about $30,000 in that particular line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4111.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no new funding for technology that we've seen outside of what I presented this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4116.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be able to get some significant federal dollars, as I explained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4120.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Department of Public Health funding should be reasonably stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4123.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That funds a nurse and some of the work that's done on health prevention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4128.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Early childhood funding through the grant account is expected to lose 30% of current level as priorities shift from programs to workforce development support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4139.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In other words, increasing the salaries of people in the nonprofit sector and providing additional training for them because they're well underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4148.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's certainly a worthy priority<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4150.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they didn't say we'll do both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4152.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They said we'll take the money from the programs and move it over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4156.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a little bit more there, but it's not clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4160.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just got through talking a little bit about maintenance and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4165.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a finite pot of gold out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4168.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you just can't say we'll just do everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4172.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll try to provide you with options across the board so you can select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4176.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And hopefully, we'll continue to search out new sources of funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4180.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: like we have with the vocational school and other things and opiate prevention to augment what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4185.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the general distributions coming from the state place a tremendous burden on the locality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4192.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost of health care keeps going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4195.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just don't know, you know, where it's coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4197.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't know what Washington's going to do and what's going to happen to that situation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4202.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It goes back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4204.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are a lot of other factors that have to come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4207.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we also have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4209.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to carry at least a 2.5% increase in salary negotiations, which isn't outrageous, but it's money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4219.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you also have step increases that people who are starting, the young teachers move up the steps, that's on top of the 2.5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4226.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of factors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4229.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be easy for me to get up and say, sure, tell me whatever you want me to fix, tell me whatever you want me to do, go add this, add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4235.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not that simple and you know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4237.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, what it is is that we have to lay it all out and decide what's most important to us and move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4244.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a lot of great things going on in this community and go a lot of great things going on in the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4248.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should be very proud of the work you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4250.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very proud of the administration and city hall supporting us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4254.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, you know, there will be some limitations and we'll have to make some tough choices, forced choices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4259.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the budget process is beginning at the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4263.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep watching the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4264.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go up and lobby, you know, for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4267.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk to people about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4269.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll look for additional grants, look for additional revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4272.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've recaptured some revenue through the minute man activity, the revenue coming in through the vocational school, but still it's going to be spread out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4280.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just wanted to give you a quick snapshot of the state budget so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4284.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll keep you posted and we'll keep talking budget as we go forward and try to set priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4298.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, that's the Minuteman bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4299.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4300.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in another year from now, we won't have a bus going to Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4306.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to try and get a smaller vehicle, which may cost less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4310.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if I lose the reimbursement for non-resident last year, two years ago, it was almost $3 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4315.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then it went down to half of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4317.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year in the House budget, it's $250,000 for that line item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4323.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, there's about 16 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4325.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next year, I would expect eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4329.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You could do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4331.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, hey, listen, if you can't go one way, we'll must own the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4335.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How's that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4336.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4337.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4338.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4339.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4419.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, it's definitely an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4420.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just so you know, the Medicaid funding is generated by students who are eligible through disabilities and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4426.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4428.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Short Collaborative is our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4430.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: broker, if you will, it comes back through it, but it goes into the city treasury.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4434.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as the mayor points out, it adds to the total pie that's then available for redistribution to the schools, to the city and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4440.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's factored into the overall who gets what kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4443.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there's some people that say they wanted to come to them, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4446.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: quite frankly, it's the same pot of gold we just simply work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4450.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it could be $400,000, $500,000 that we could lose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4454.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the state could lose that much more because they're dependent on it as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4459.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that could drive the cost of health care right through the roof, which will also impact our employees as they have to pay more for health insurance and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4466.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4467.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would bring them to the bargaining table, because next year, while we're covered for next year, bargaining for the successor contracts will start all over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4475.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as they lose money in terms of the health care costs and things of that type, they're going to be looking for something to make it up in salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4483.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all this stuff has triggers that are going to be thought about, planned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4489.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to understand what it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4492.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we commence something going forward, we've got to realize it might have ripple effect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4497.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: multiple years down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4498.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just, you know, any one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4499.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's that year, maybe, but then there's more going on down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4504.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as it, as it stands now, we're, you know, we're using a lot of generated revenue to support our operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4512.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some point in time that generated revenue will hit a wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4515.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can only make so much at any given time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4518.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's all kinds of issues, but Washington, you know, is a, is a real black hole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4523.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You really don't know a lot of the programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4525.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Title two is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4527.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 150,000 go into salaries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4529.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That could disappear, you know, for class size reduction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4534.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other programs like that for supplies, materials, bilingual, you know, money could come down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4541.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you can see, our population is significantly growing in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4546.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, I think the issue of, and I know it's unpopular, the millionaire's tax is out there someplace, whether that actually goes through in a year from now certainly would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4556.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the revenue pie, but then again, if that money gets generated, who will get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4562.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue of any money generated through the marijuana bill, sales taxes, other things like that, all up in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4569.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a whole group out there that want to cut the sales tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4571.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want to bring it back down again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4573.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of discussions that are going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4578.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we've got to balance it all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4580.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I love it when people come up and say, we need this and need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4583.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I, you know, and I really respect that because they're telling, they're advocating for what they want and that you should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=4590.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But then our job becomes how to balance it out, how to, how to do as much as we can and fairly apportionate to the things that, you know, they're important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=96.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=99.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm here tonight with Dr. Heidi Riccio, the principal director of the Medford Vocational Technical School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=106.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And she's going to go into some detail for you with regard to this particular capital skills program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=114.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money was awarded by the governor recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=117.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Contract was just signed the end of March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=120.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there is going to be approximately $1.3 million of altogether between the state grant and in-kind contributions from various vendors and others of their money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=134.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we need a $250,000 capital match to advance our culinary arts and hospitality program and our advanced manufacturing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=143.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you go up the technical school now, you'll see that the old print shop is now being deconstructed and being made into a first class hospitality and restaurant center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=153.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you're also going to see the advance of the advanced manufacturing activity going on with robotics and engineering going on, things that were never really considered likely in a vocational technical school years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=167.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Riccio has done a terrific job putting all this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=172.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very pleased that the governor saw his way to give us a half million dollars, and I'm going to let her go into details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=179.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have some materials that we've given you previously, but also tonight she's added some supplementals that she can discuss with you so that you have an idea of what we're investing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=190.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think this is a terrific project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=192.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to advance our activities technically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=196.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also going to help us partner with some very significant area individuals and corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=202.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's one of the best things we've ever done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=205.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Riccio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=207.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Belson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1338.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before Heidi goes on a little bit, tonight she came down, she left school, left 200 members of the advisory committees, all 20, 10 per advisory committee up there, working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1352.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: doing additional contributions and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1357.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1358.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incredible up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1358.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working up there, developing all kinds of ways to assist the school moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1364.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1365.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's absolutely incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1375.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we have a- No, meaning leave tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1378.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a bracelet on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1458.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you have is you have a situation in which if a school district does not have a particular vocational program, a student from our community could opt to go to a regional vocational school which has the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1471.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the program that has absorbed most of our youngsters who have gone out of the district is Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1476.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some to Essex Aggie and places like that for agricultural programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1480.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Minuteman has been the main thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1483.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was as many as 50 youngsters out there a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1486.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And given their tuition rates and the like, with special ed assessments on top of it, we're pushing $1 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1495.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next year, we'll have, what, eight people out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1498.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have eight people out, and the year after, there'll be zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1501.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were no applications that came in from Minuteman this year because we have programs that can't touch our young people because we have the programs in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1509.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to that, with the expansion of what we're doing and working with Everett and some other communities that need a vocational program, we're actually going to be bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1525.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the turnaround in a short period of time could be close to $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1529.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that goes back to reinvesting in a school, because when you talk about technical education, you have to reinvest all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1536.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply say, well, the equipment is there, and it's going to be there for the next 50 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1541.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not like bricks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1543.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be the state of the art.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1545.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to be able to reinvest on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1549.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to give us that capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1551.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to give us that capacity to hire people who have a great deal of experience, rather than people who are starting out in careers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1558.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1560.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the entire way we look at the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1563.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that sort of, I hope that answers your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1566.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you need more, I can tell you more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1579.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the cost difference at eight students, probably a couple hundred thousand dollars, the most 150, you know, thousand dollars down from that in a year from now, that'll be gone altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1590.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's probably very significant is that Minuteman is looking to rebuild its facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1597.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to build a 628-pupil facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1601.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have 628 pupils to put in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1604.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, the cost of that is going to be absorbed by the remaining towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1608.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 16 communities that were in the Minuteman district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1611.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are now nine, as seven communities opted to leave because they didn't want to be part of the capital plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1619.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that Minuteman was going to assess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1621.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to guess that some community is going to pay $40,000, $50,000 per pupil to go to Minuteman, because there's going to be a capital charge to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1630.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's not a very workable kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1633.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the state's going to have to intervene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1634.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the short term, we're out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1637.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1638.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they were going to get the ability to assess a capital fee on top of the tuition fee, which could have been $10,000 on top of the tuition, which would have gone up to over $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1647.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: $35,000 per kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1651.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1652.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We got ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1653.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We saw it coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1654.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why we were pushing back on the Minuteman issues a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1658.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're also saving transportation, because we won't be sending youngsters there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1662.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another $65,000 to $75,000 a year in transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1666.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a lot of positives in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1668.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, the evening school programs that Dr. Riccio has started, bringing people in from the community to learn trades and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1675.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be another major thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1677.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for not only revenue, but also to give our people a chance to gain the skills they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1682.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, one of the discussions about jobs and creating jobs is giving people skill training, because you can't necessarily protect an industry which is no longer viable in this country by just simply saying, let's hope it comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1696.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to give people skill training so they can move on to the next industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1700.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And another thing that she's done, which I think is particularly significant, she's clustered and created programs so that you're cross-trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1707.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you're an HVAC in some of these other areas, you're learning multiple skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1711.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if one industry goes south, you've got capacity to move to other industries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1715.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1718.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not only is hospitality, you know, the restaurant, but it's the back of the house, it's the front of the house, it's all the maintenance of the house that goes with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=1727.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a major, major industry that produces all kinds of jobs and allows people to move across the lines as they cross trains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2585.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may want to tell them about the cooperative ed statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2689.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mentioned the laborers, Lou Mandarini's shop has been incredible, training the youngsters in Hopkinton and developing things and guaranteeing jobs for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2698.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, the construction industry is booming right now, and they're being guaranteed some incredible opportunities right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2705.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of quick points on going outside, just to augment what Dr. Riccio said, is that we have to pay attention to Davis-Bacon Law, can't compete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2716.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with certain kinds of activities out there, because that's, it violates certain laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2720.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to be careful, because remember, a high school student can be 14, 15 years old, so certain power equipment that they use has to be regulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2729.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of child labor laws and things like that that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2732.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anytime we cooperate with someone or look for a job project, we have to all take all that in consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2739.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone who wants to work with us has to get CORI checked and all kinds of other kinds of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2745.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: investigations to make sure that we're not sending somebody into a place where there's problems, whether they're alcohol, drugs, or, you know, safety issues and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2755.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of little things that you've got to pay attention to, but Heidi's on top of it and she's, she's been terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2761.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Lisa has been terrific as has a whole group of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2765.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've really got a spirit of esprit de corps over there that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2857.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should also be noted too that next year, every ninth grader at the high school will explore shops at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2867.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've set it up as one of their options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2869.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They will go through with that as an elective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2871.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will take some time to see a shop in a rotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2875.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working out the schedule right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2876.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how many days or how many weeks you're going to put them in, but that's going to be part of their electives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2884.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have a chance to see that and see it from, for example, when they take something like biotech or environmental science, it just crosses over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2890.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just crosses over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2892.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are kids who are going to go from the vocational tech<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2896.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MIT because of their ability to put it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2959.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to tell you one quick story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2961.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to the Roberts Junior High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2963.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Never a quick story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2964.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what can you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2966.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to Roberts Junior High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2967.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to read from a phone book next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2970.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2972.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I remember the name Ken Peck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2974.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he was well before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2975.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're all too young.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2977.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2980.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the goal was to make a game with a spinner on it, you know, a block of wood with different things on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2986.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I invented the first mini game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2988.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I could never get the block of wood to be square so the block could get smaller and smaller and smaller until the spinning just went beyond the wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2997.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was no wood left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2998.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'd take off, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=2999.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3000.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Al Johnson, who became the vocational director years ago, remember Al?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3004.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Al became the vocational director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3006.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kicked me out of sheet metal at the Roberts one year because he said, you'll ruin everything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3012.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I never got beyond the lazy brown<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3015.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dog jumped all the way, the red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog and put me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3019.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that wasn't my skill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3055.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one last comment, Mr. President, which is simply this, is that a couple weeks ago, I was here, and you voted to submit the SOI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3062.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That plays into this, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3064.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be some incredible things moving out in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3067.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3068.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3069.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The whole science labs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3071.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: fields, other things that were done, all contributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3074.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the next period of time, you're going to see something that you probably couldn't have envisioned because of people like Dr. Riccio and others who are investing themselves, bringing real talent to the place, and with real vision, and with real, let's say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3090.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: aggressive and assertive ways to get funding to augment what we get from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3095.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So thank you for your support because you've been there supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3098.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to come to you for city money and we appreciate what you do to support us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3102.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3264.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman, this year's rate was something like $17,500 plus $4,500 for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3273.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That rate will go up and the capital fee gets added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3275.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project it's going to be at $30,000 in another couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3281.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're using a rate that is around $12,000 plus $4,500 or $4,000 for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3292.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: special needs, plus an administrative fee of about $1,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3297.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're probably in the $15,000, $16,000 variety altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3302.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's definitely a good deal for our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3305.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the same token, it provides us with substantial revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3308.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You understand the term marginal utility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3311.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you've got so much space, it's already paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3313.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everything else is extra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3315.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, we're not costing ourselves money by adding staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3319.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filling in where we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3321.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: get value with existing operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3329.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, for a particular... Well, it depends on how many youngsters we have there, but, you know, with... Well, we have a hundred students, okay, in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3342.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When that actually is realized, we'll be seeing a hundred times, maybe a million and a half to two million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3350.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hasn't started yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3352.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought vocational students were already coming here from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3356.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are, but there's, they are, but there's, I believe that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3359.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are, but there's about 30 of those right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3362.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3367.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/43IdaIBcFp0&t=3368.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1532.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the Council, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1534.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm here tonight with Dr. Heidi Riccio, the Principal Director of the Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1540.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: vocational technical school, and she's going to go into some detail for you with regard to this particular capital skills program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1549.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The money was awarded by the governor recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1552.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Contract was just signed the end of March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1555.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there is going to be approximately $1.3 million of altogether between the state grant and in-kind contributions from various vendors and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1567.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of their money, but we need a $250,000 capital match to advance our culinary arts and hospitality program and our advanced manufacturing program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1578.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you go up the technical school now, you'll see that the old print shop is now being deconstructed and being made into a first-class hospitality and restaurant center, and you're also going to see the advance of the advanced manufacturing activity going on with robotics and engineering going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1596.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: things that were never really considered likely in a vocational technical school years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1603.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Riccio has done a terrific job putting all this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1606.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very pleased that the governor saw his way to give us a half million dollars, and I'm going to let her go into details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1614.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have some materials that we've given you previously, but also tonight she's added some supplementals that she can discuss with you so that you have an idea of what we're investing in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1625.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, we think this is a terrific project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1628.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to, uh, advance our activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1631.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Technically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1631.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also going to help us partner with some very significant area individuals and corporations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1638.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's one of the best things we've ever done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1641.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Richie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2773.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before Heidi goes on a little bit, tonight she came down, she left school, left 200 members of the advisory committees, all 20, 10 per advisory committee up there, working on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2787.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: doing additional contributions and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2793.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incredible up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2794.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working up there, developing all kinds of ways to assist the school moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2799.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2801.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's absolutely incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2811.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we have a- No, meaning leave tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2813.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a bracelet on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2894.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you have is you have a situation in which if a school district does not have a particular vocational program, a student from our community could opt to go to a regional vocational school, which has the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2906.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the program that has absorbed most of our youngsters who have gone out of the district is Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2912.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's some to Essex Aggie and places like that for agricultural programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2915.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Minuteman has been the main thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2918.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was as many as 50 youngsters out there a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2922.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And given their tuition rates and the like, with special ed assessments on top of it, we're pushing $1 million a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2931.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next year, we'll have, what, eight people out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2933.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have eight people out, and the year after, there'll be zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2936.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were no applications that came in from Minuteman this year because we have programs that can't touch our young people because we have the programs in-house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2944.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to that, with the expansion of what we're doing and working with Everett and some other communities that need a vocational program, we're actually going to be bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on tuition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2960.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the turnaround in a short period of time could be close to $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2965.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that goes back to reinvesting in a school, because when we talk about technical education, you have to reinvest all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2972.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can't just simply say, well, the equipment is there, and it's going to be there for the next 50 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2977.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not like bricks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2978.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be the state of the art.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2981.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got to be able to reinvest on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2985.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to give us that capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2986.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to give us that capacity to hire people who have a great deal of experience, rather than people who are starting out in careers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2993.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2995.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the entire way we look at the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2999.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that sort of, I hope that answers your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3001.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you need more, I can tell you more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3015.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the cost difference at eight students, probably a couple hundred thousand dollars, the most 150, you know, thousand dollars down from that in a year from now, that'll be gone altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3025.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that's probably very significant is that Minuteman is looking to rebuild its facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3033.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to build a 628-pupil facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3036.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have 628 pupils to put in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3039.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, the cost of that is going to be absorbed by the remaining towns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3043.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 16 communities that were in the Minuteman district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3046.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are now nine, as seven communities opted to leave because they didn't want to be part of the capital plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3054.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that Minuteman was going to assess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3056.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to guess that some community is going to pay $40,000, $50,000 per pupil to go to Minuteman, because there's going to be a capital charge to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3066.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think it's not a very workable kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3068.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the state's going to have to intervene.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3070.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the short term, we're out of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3073.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3074.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they were going to get the ability to assess a capital fee on top of the tuition fee, which could have been $10,000 on top of the tuition, which would have gone up to over $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3083.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: $35,000 per kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3086.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unrealistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3087.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We got ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3088.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We saw it coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3089.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why we were pushing back on the Minuteman issues a few years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3093.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're also saving transportation, because we won't be sending youngsters there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3098.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's another $65,000 to $75,000 a year in transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3101.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a lot of positives in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3103.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, the evening school programs that Dr. Riccio has started, bringing people in from the community to learn trades and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3110.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be another major thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3112.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for not only revenue, but also to give our people a chance to gain the skills they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3119.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, one of the discussions about jobs and creating jobs is giving people skill training, because you can't necessarily protect an industry which is no longer viable in this country by just simply saying, let's hope it comes back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3132.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to give people skill training so they can move on to the next industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3136.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And another thing that she's done, which I think is particularly significant, she's clustered and created programs so that you're cross-trained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3142.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you're an HVAC in some of these other areas, you're learning multiple skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3146.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if one industry goes south, you've got capacity to move to other industries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3151.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3153.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not only is hospitality, you know, it's the restaurant, but it's the back of the house, it's the front of the house, it's all the maintenance of the house that goes with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3163.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a major, major industry that produces all kinds of jobs and allows people to move across the lines as they cross trains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4003.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may want to tell them about the cooperative ed statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4107.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mentioned the laborers, Lou Mandarini's shop has been incredible, training the youngsters at Hopkinton and developing things and guaranteeing jobs for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4116.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, the construction industry is booming right now, and they're being guaranteed some incredible opportunities right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4123.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of quick points on going outside, just to augment what Dr. Riccio said, is that we have to pay attention to the Davis-Bacon law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4133.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can't compete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4134.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with certain kinds of activities out there, because that's, it violates certain laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4138.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to be careful, because remember, a high school student can be 14, 15 years old, so certain power equipment that they use has to be regulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4147.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's all kinds of child labor laws and things like that that we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4150.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anytime we cooperate with someone or look for a job project, we have to all take all that in consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4157.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anyone who wants to work with us has to get CORI checked and all kinds of other kinds of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4163.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: investigations to make sure that we're not sending somebody into a place where there's problems, whether they're alcohol, drugs, or, you know, safety issues and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4172.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of little things that you've got to pay attention to, but Heidi's on top of it and she's, she's been terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4179.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Lisa has been terrific, as has the whole group of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4183.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've really got a spirit of esprit de corps over there that's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4186.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Incredible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4275.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should also be noted, too, that next year, every ninth grader at the high school will explore shops at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4284.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've set it up as one of their options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4287.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They will go through with that as an elective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4289.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will take some time to see a shop in a rotation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4292.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working out the schedule right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4294.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how many days or how many weeks you're going to put them in, but that's going to be part of their electives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4302.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have a chance to see that and see it from, for example, you know, you take something like biotech or environmental science, it just crosses over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4308.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It just crosses over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4310.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are kids who are going to go from the vocational tech school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4314.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MIT because of their ability to put it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4377.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll tell you one quick story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4378.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to the Roberts Junior High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4382.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what can you do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4384.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to Roberts Junior High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4385.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to read from a phone book next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4388.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4390.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I may remember the name Ken Peck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4392.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he was well before you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4393.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're all too young.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4395.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4398.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the goal was to make a game with a spinner on it, you know, a block of wood with different things on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4404.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I invented the first mini game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4406.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I could never get the block of wood to be square so the block could get smaller and smaller and smaller until the spinning just went beyond the wood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4415.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was no wood left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4416.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'd take off, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4417.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Take it off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4418.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Al Johnson, who became the vocational director years ago, remember Al?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4422.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Al became the vocational director.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4424.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kicked me out of sheet metal at the Roberts one year because he said, you'll ruin everything here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4430.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I never got beyond the lazy brown<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4433.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The dog jumped all the way, the red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4438.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that wasn't my skill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4473.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one last comment, Mr. President, which is simply this, is that a couple weeks ago I was here, and you voted to submit the SOI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4480.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That plays into this, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4481.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be some incredible things moving out in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4485.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4486.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4487.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The whole science labs, fields, other things that were done, all contributed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4493.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the next period of time, you're going to see something that you probably couldn't have envisioned because of people like Dr. Riccio and others who are investing themselves, bringing real talent to the place, and with real vision, and with real, let's say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4508.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: aggressive and assertive ways to get funding to augment what we get from the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4513.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, uh, thank you for your support because you've been there supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4516.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to come to you for city money and we appreciate what you do to support us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4520.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4682.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman, this year's rate was something like $17,500 plus $4,500 for special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4690.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That rate will go up and the capital fee gets added.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4694.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project it's going to be at $30,000 in another couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4699.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're using a rate that is around $12,000 plus $4,500 or $4,000 for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4710.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: special needs plus an administrative fee of about $1,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4715.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're probably $15,000, $16,000 variety altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4719.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's definitely a good deal for our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4723.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the same token, it provides us with substantial revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4726.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You understand the term marginal utility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4728.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you've got so much space, it's already paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4731.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everything else is extra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4733.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, we're not costing ourselves money by adding staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4737.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just filling in where we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4739.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: get value with existing operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4747.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, for a particular... Well, it depends on how many youngsters we have there, but, you know, with... Well, if we have a hundred students, okay, in the building, when that actually is realized, we'll be seeing a hundred times maybe a million and a half to two million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4768.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hasn't started yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4770.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought vocational students were already coming here from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4774.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are, but there's, they are, but there's, I believe that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4777.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are, but there's about 30 of those right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4784.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4785.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4786.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=4786.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=124.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an item for community participation, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=306.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, uh, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services is with us this evening for three different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=314.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This particular report is particularly significant since you may have seen some items in the newspaper today is latest today about opiate issues in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=324.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh, Tony has prepared a report based on our initial screening on this pilot program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=329.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it should be of strong interest to us with regard to how we're looking at, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=334.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: screening our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1664.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we don't have anything new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1667.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly talked to DCR, but there's no new commitment from them at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2470.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just a quick thing on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2472.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, this is a report you asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2474.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a follow-up report of a report that we previously gave you on the AED.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2480.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with specific names and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2484.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: specific discussions of where they're located.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2486.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a follow-up report to a previous report, but Tony is here to give you more detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3152.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Tony, maybe you could explain the different sites that we think, you know, technically, I mean, a coach and a trainer could bring a unit with them to every field and every activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3164.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3165.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because you see how portable they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3169.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could bring it with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3171.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3171.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think what we're proposing going forward is that we have them actually on site at these places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3176.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in case something happens and someone is not there with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3180.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since we have trainers and coaches going to every game, I'm not sure we're in a critical stage yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3187.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the future, obviously we want to be in a situation where these things are automatically there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3193.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The downside to that is they have to be checked fairly frequently to make sure the battery's loaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3198.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that means people have to go to these places early to check them in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3202.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of logistical work that's associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3270.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How long is the actual battery charge good for, Tony?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3277.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words saying it's, you know, generally should be in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3280.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, you know, we certainly wouldn't want to malfunction to be the outcome of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3483.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we, you know, obviously have to work with our partners, the people that we play sports with and so on and so on, and other school districts, is to have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3492.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we go to their school, do they have things in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3496.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we're at other places, do they have things in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3498.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just like we're talking about the nurses on field trips and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3502.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to be asking that question wherever we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3506.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's something major going on, do you have facilities on site?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3510.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't know if you know this, but one of our former nurses used to get paid to go to the theater shows in Boston to sit in the audience just in case a nurse was necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3524.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The theaters didn't have their own medical staff, so they wanted someone there who was medically trained to intervene should a situation take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3533.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I suspect we're going to have this conversation since the law not only affects Medford, but it affects every school district and every community across the commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3541.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be one of those discussions, do you have the right equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3544.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same way with first aid kits, the same way with ambulance calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3548.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We play a football game in a different field, we don't necessarily bring our ambulance, they have their ambulance in the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3553.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to obviously work out a lot of coordination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4255.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report will be given in Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5060.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6135.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a report that you requested and it's listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6138.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty obvious as to what's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6141.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6143.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll give you updates as they require.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6158.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a couple of announcements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6189.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did you want to say something else before we throw a couple of quick information pieces out there tomorrow night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6195.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm at the city council again, seeking matching funds for the culinary arts hospitality project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6204.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, you've got a breakout here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6207.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you can see, we're putting in quite a bit of our own money and outside money as well as the state grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6213.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so there's 500,000 from the state is 813,000 in kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6219.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, um, we're asking the council and free cash for 250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6222.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll be there tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6225.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, and also, um, because next Monday is Passover, we inadvertently scheduled it for Monday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6232.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to move it to the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6234.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, I scheduled, you know, just tentatively the 26th, but that may have some conflicts with the mayor and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6241.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll get back to you for a meeting on, on the community schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6244.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a date that works for all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6246.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6247.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: looking to schedule a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6249.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll check with the mayor's office and elsewhere, uh, for a community school and not community schools, a, uh, school council report night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6257.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6258.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a committee of the whole on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6259.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just some of the dates that we're trying to juggle to make sure everybody can be in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6264.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6294.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I suggest is that those meetings tend to be very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6298.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6300.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might want a different meeting for that, just simply because those meetings are long as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6308.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the same people, but that can go for a few hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6311.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6333.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6334.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6334.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd have to schedule as a regular meeting, but it's our special meeting that's put that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6366.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're talking about the PTO meeting being in council chambers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6368.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6409.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Loschuto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=100.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he sent me something at the email late this afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=277.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services, is with us this evening for three different reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=285.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This particular report is particularly significant, since you may have seen some items in the newspaper today, as latest today, about opiate issues in Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=295.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Tony has prepared a report based on our initial screening on this pilot program, and I think it should be of strong interest to us with regard to how we're looking at screening our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1635.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we don't have any, anything new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1638.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, we certainly talked to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=1640.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: DCR, but there's no new commitment from them at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2441.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just a quick thing on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2443.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, this is a report you asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2445.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a follow-up report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2448.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of a report that we previously gave you on the AED, so with specific names and specific discussions of where they're located.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=2457.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a follow-up report to a previous report, but Tony is here to give you more details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3122.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Tony, maybe you could explain the different sites that we think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3128.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, technically, I mean, a coach and a trainer could bring a unit with them to every field and every activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3135.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have to necessarily, because you see how portable they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3140.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They could bring it with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3141.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3142.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think what we're proposing going forward is, is that we have them actually on site at these places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3147.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in case something happens and someone is not there with it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3151.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But since we have trainers and coaches going to every game, I'm not sure we're in a critical stage yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3158.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the future, obviously, we want to be in a situation where these things are automatically there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3164.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The downside to that is they have to be checked fairly frequently to make sure the battery's loaded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3169.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that means people have to go to these places early to check them in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3173.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a little logistical work that's associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3241.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How long is the actual battery charge good for, Tony?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3247.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3248.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words, saying it generally should be in good shape, but again, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3253.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly wouldn't want a malfunction to be the outcome of anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3453.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things that we, you know, obviously have to work with our partners, the people that we play sports with and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3460.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So another school districts is to have that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3463.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we go to their school, do they have things in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3467.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we're at other places, do they have things in place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3469.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just like we're talking about the nurses on field trips and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3472.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, we're going to be asking that question wherever we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3477.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's something major going on, do you have facilities on site?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3481.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't know if you know this, but one of our former nurses used to get paid to go to the theater shows in Boston to sit in the audience just in case a nurse was necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3492.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, because the theaters didn't have their own medical staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3497.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they wanted someone there who was medically trained to intervene should a situation take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3504.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I suspect we're going to have this conversation since the law normally affects Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3508.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but it affects every school district and every community across the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3511.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's going to be one of those discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3513.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have the right equipment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3515.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same way with first aid kits, the same way with ambulance calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3518.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We play a football game in a different field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3520.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't necessarily bring our ambulance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3521.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have their ambulances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=3522.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's, you know, we have to obviously, um, work out a lot of coordination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=4226.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report will be given in Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6106.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a report that you requested, and it's listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6109.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty obvious as to what's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6160.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did you want to throw a couple of quick information pieces out there tomorrow night?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6166.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm at the city council again seeking matching funds for the culinary arts hospitality project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6176.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got a breakout here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6178.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you can see, we're putting in quite a bit of our own money and outside money as well as a state grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6184.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6185.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's 500,000 from the state, there's 813,000 in kind, and we're asking the council for free cash for 250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6193.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll be there tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6194.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then also,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6199.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because next Monday is Passover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6201.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We inadvertently scheduled it for Monday night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6203.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to move it to the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6205.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, I scheduled, you know, just tentatively the 26th, but that may have some conflicts with the mayor and other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6211.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll get back to you for a meeting on, on the community schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6215.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a date that works for all of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6217.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll looking to schedule a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6220.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll check with the mayor's office and elsewhere, uh, for a community school, not a community schools, a, uh, school council report night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6228.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just some of the dates that we're trying to juggle to make sure everybody can be in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6235.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we're good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6265.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6265.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I suggest is, is that those meetings tend to be very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6270.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6271.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You might want a different meeting for that, just simply because those meetings are long as it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6278.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the same people, but that can go for a few hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6282.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6304.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/lq25S5HOVFA&t=6305.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd have to schedule as a regular meeting, but it's our special meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=843.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=846.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=861.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=872.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=876.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=884.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible and to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=896.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if, in fact, they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design and then later construction documents, which would then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=913.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: lead to an actual implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=915.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at this point, all we're asking you for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team, to review what we have at our schools, and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=932.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a very proactive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=934.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=941.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=954.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=962.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=972.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=978.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=987.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with that, I just ask that the city council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=991.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: approve what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we could have the state share the cost of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1007.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1038.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are two programs at MSBA that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1043.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is called Accelerated Repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1045.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not the program we're applying under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1047.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the core program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1049.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1054.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1055.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1060.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1065.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, all the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1075.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and see what their interest level is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1077.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1085.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1089.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1095.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It goes back to 1970.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1096.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's clear that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1099.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1102.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that the roof was replaced in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1106.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that at some point in time the roof is going to need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1109.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a replacement, we think it's five, six years out, but if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1117.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that there are, the vocational school is moving into very high tech areas, and anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state of the art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1134.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anything that moves the show forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1137.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: enables us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1143.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another example would be the floor tiles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1146.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1149.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, they're not dangerous because they're not friable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1152.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can't pick them up without an abatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1155.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And an abatement costs a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1158.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1167.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1171.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1179.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are some things that might actually fly through, and we'd like to find out what they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1183.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again, but it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1195.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which would be necessary to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1197.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Technology is another major area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1199.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With testing now being done on computers, with reporting all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1215.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an area that might be of interest to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1217.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly would move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1219.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've also applied or will apply under the E-Rate Program, the Universal Libraries Program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1225.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1229.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are things that, you know, we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1231.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to advance our possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1233.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1240.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1250.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1278.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the SOI includes everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1281.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SOI just simply talks about everything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1284.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1293.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1301.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fire alarm system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1302.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are things, the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1304.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1310.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have a very solid building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1313.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a building that needs to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1315.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't buy a CMU building anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1320.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with the kind of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1321.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somerville is, what, $250 million to replace a building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1326.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman is $155 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1328.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Waltham's looking at a couple hundred million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1331.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to spend that kind of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1332.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1345.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's sort of what we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1346.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1351.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1361.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1363.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1383.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That it references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1385.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So each under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1397.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just, those are one, uh, the last two pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1411.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: March 16th, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1412.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My address is March 17th, mine is March 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1446.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1446.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1451.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are the things you're going to do yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1453.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1497.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's a discussion, Councilor, that we would have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1500.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First we wanna know who's gonna join with us on what projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1504.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1514.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because otherwise, you know, we have a plan that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1517.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: might avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1525.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1535.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1539.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can keep it on the boards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1541.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But once they determine it's eligible, we can go back in and apply for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1545.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1585.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It really depends on what they determine eligibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1589.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somerville, when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1593.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I don't think we're in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1598.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're looking at something much smaller than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1600.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1607.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1613.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at least we know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1615.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what our partners are willing to put up on the table, so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1659.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the school committee had several meetings on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1662.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1670.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The major issues will be going forward at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1673.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school is now the oldest major building in our possession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1679.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things I told the school committee so I feel comfortable sharing it here is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state funded planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1699.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1703.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1709.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1716.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got some other grants out there they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1718.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposal for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1725.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1728.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1746.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1945.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you a couple of examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1947.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them at some point if you're interested, but the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1961.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take the locker rooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1964.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been up to the locker rooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1965.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1970.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The girls' locker room, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1972.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of old things in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1974.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of old marble, old shower stalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1977.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot of empty space, unutilized space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1981.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That needs to be redone, because if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1990.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1992.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same thing is true with the men's locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1995.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1996.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just these are the things that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=1998.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2014.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2019.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2025.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think those are the kinds of cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2027.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now there's three cafeterias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2029.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, or maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2045.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's critical, because that's going to be up on the first floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2048.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be a restaurant for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2050.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to tie into our partnerships with Wynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2055.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2058.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue-generating activities that will support other programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2066.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will free up space where Cafe Elektor is now, and we can do some other things with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2070.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2076.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2082.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have to give them the big cavern that they have, because they don't use that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2086.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not what printing is about anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2089.36s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Dr. Ritchiell, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies, putting programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2107.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2112.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That creates great opportunities for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2115.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2118.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2122.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2125.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2132.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2136.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: possibly projecting over two or three years, a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2141.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2150.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are ways that I think we're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2153.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that looking at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2163.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plan, recognizing we've got to come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2166.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not voting for money tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2168.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're voting for planning tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2169.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2173.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we were asking you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2174.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2176.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2247.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we become eligible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2249.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would then petition MSBA for a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for or with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2262.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they would reimburse us at the same rate they would reimburse the construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2267.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2275.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We lay it out, but they reimburse us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2298.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2303.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Earlier this evening, I heard you talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2305.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to consider options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2306.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you want to know who's going to pay for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2308.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2319.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have the copies of the votes if you need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2323.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 7-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2356.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2441.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I can't tell you that, because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2447.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2453.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2458.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some things that they would say, that's your problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2596.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all good questions, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2599.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Personally, I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2606.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2610.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Personally, I don't think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2612.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2618.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2625.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2629.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think that's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2631.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2742.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why are we throwing everything at the wall right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2745.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2748.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's to get you into an exploration process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2751.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to find out what the state is willing to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2754.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you put down everything to talk about, and you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2764.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2766.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2776.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Different things emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2777.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People want to talk about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2779.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that we put it down so that we could explore them with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2787.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2791.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2799.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll merge the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2801.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2804.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And any amount that we're going to spend, you're gonna prioritize along with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2809.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not gonna be the superintendent who makes the final call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2812.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The superintendent might make a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2814.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you're gonna decide, and the mayor's gonna decide, and the school committee's gonna decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2822.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2827.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2831.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know what the relative things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2834.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state's not going to commit to something before they see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2837.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible because I know what the economics are between the different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2844.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't mean that it won't, it won't go down a little bit because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2932.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying, but my experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before, as you know, we've had science labs,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2939.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've built new buildings and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2940.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first, and then we'll look at whether these things, any of these other things are possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2950.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they know the difference between a fire alarm system and a roof and a cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2957.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the difference, and they know where we would like to go first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2961.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder who is involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together a chance to be heard,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2970.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2974.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're giving them a chance to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2976.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2982.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=2986.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3041.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3052.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3056.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3064.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we're giving them all these things and they might say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3068.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're doing something with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3070.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3073.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we put it in front of them, and we got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3077.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you have to try all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3079.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You put it in front of them and say, are you interested in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3082.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could you consider this to be a reasonable investment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3085.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3090.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're moving forward with a planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3093.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3102.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is going to take,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3104.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: probably two to three years to actually actualize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3107.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the meantime, that will inform our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3114.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3119.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then grant applications we make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3121.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone were to say we can't get grants for this, for example, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center, that wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3132.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we got a grant to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3134.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to know where we have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3136.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3140.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can then lay it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3142.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3147.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's going to be needed to move the project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3150.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3155.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3159.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3167.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3192.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, because I don't know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3195.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the extent to which any of these things would be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3198.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I do know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3199.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I'm not talking about funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3200.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the actual cost of your SOI request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3203.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I wouldn't want to give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3211.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe all doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3220.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we can do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3222.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we get back from a planning process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3225.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we get to a financial phase, then we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3229.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3234.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3283.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3294.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all just like anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3296.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We come to you with a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3297.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We come to you with other kinds of financial things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3299.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can tell us how much more you want to put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3302.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3307.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You are going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3308.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3310.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3316.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know that there are some heating things that we wanna do at the high school that we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3322.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3325.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we should find out if we have a partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3327.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3329.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that technology is moving at a rapid rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3332.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we know that it's gonna be expensive to increase all the technology that's gonna be required of public schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3339.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if someone's willing to partner with us, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3343.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3344.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That gives you those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3345.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can decide that I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3354.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3361.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My job is to give you options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3363.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3513.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get construction going on something, any project that gets approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3522.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the like, but we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3530.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3538.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3544.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is, is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3620.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're at such an early stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3622.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3623.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money, on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3630.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: policies, on zoning, on any number of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3633.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3651.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3657.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that they consider to be important to them because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3665.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3670.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I like the participation of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3671.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have to make all the decisions myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3674.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3680.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing's going to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3682.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying to explore who wants to partner with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3686.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3690.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3697.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3698.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3705.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly, you're going to face a roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3707.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you're going to face technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3709.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems, and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3713.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3717.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: before we get funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3719.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3726.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk about these things and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3730.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get in the game and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3736.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we need to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3738.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's my job to put it in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3740.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3758.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3763.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How come they're not part of the SOI?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3765.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're part of the general building envelope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3767.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's something that we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3769.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're part of the plumbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3769.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're part of the heating system, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3772.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all part of the same consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3774.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3781.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3785.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3804.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not talk, we can add stuff after the deadline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3807.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk stuff, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3809.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk with them about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3810.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe they'll let us add, maybe they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3812.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3904.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess I'm a stakeholder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3906.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3914.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well and are in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3921.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my exact point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3930.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can go back and forth on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3978.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for the record, I'm gonna tell you the high school is a safe place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=3981.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's always more we can do to improve it, and some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4561.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4563.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would meet to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4565.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4570.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4575.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're not going to meet for another two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4577.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I think that that slows this down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4579.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is due in a very short period of time into the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4583.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards, but the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4591.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think you should allow us to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4594.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to get this going, I mean, it doesn't hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4596.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not committing anything in terms of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4600.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4609.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4613.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They won't even get to us for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4615.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, we have to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4618.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because there are other communities going to submit as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4621.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're not in, we don't get any consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4625.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4633.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think you should stop it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4714.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly have no problem with any of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4716.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4719.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4726.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4732.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4739.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that that's a good thing, but I don't think we should stop getting in on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4746.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, into the state with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4748.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can continue to move and get them to come out to a sooner rather than later, because everybody's going to be submitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4754.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen till August, September, October, whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4842.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4846.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'm not a rookie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4848.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4856.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4858.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4861.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Know your options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4969.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4970.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, just one quick thing to Councilor, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4974.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just that we did an infrared study of the high school roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4977.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4983.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4983.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's about all we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4985.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out, and, you know, if we were to take it to the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4994.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=4996.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5008.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5012.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5159.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5159.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Mr. President, if I could just respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5161.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I feel I have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5163.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The document you're referring to in September was a different document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5166.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the capital plan that came from the mayor, which through the school committee, the document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee, the whole meeting that they had the week before on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5179.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you received it, what do you call it tonight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5183.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, because what do you call it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5184.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You were busy dealing with other capital<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5187.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so that we didn't confuse those two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5191.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that that's the two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5195.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5199.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We filled out the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5201.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't add to the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5202.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be happy to provide that priority list to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5206.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the form is the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5207.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you submit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5208.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't add things to an application that is not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5212.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5217.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so, but certainly we respect the right, you know, that the council has asked and we've certainly will honor that to come up with a priority list, provide it to you and provide it to MSBA as part of the discussions that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5270.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5274.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5330.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MSBA opens up a window for statements of interest in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5336.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and then expects it to follow through by the April date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5340.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They actually pushed it out a little bit this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5342.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally it's in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=5343.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they open up the window for the SOIs in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6237.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As amended, Mr. Belson, do you want to finish up with anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6240.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to finish a couple of quick statements, if I may, with your permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6244.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, some of the things that were quoted were quoted as the priorities of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6251.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they say the building structurally unsound, that's not what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6255.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the state is using as a category for things that you can put things under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6260.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the building says that the renovation of schools such as roofs, that's what they're saying you can ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6265.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not what we're saying is our need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6267.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6269.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as handicapped accessibility, we put in three elevators, ramps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6272.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've made the Little Theater or the Caron Theater now handicapped accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6277.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The building is handicapped accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6279.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6280.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with all due respect to, I understand there's a give and take here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6283.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that a lot of improvements have been made to that high school and that technical school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6289.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have helped to pay for it over the years as a city council and as a school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6293.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee had a right when this thing came out to deliberate and determine what it considered to be important and to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6302.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6303.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they then had a follow-up meeting where they voted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6307.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6308.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we're asking is for you to allow us to submit it so we can then begin a process of finding out what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6315.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can have a more robust<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6317.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: interactive process between council, school committee, mayor, administration, to determine what this city considers important, what this city wants to fund on its own, what this city wants to partner with, and what we're gonna do in what time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3UkqIlWnJXM&t=6331.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's all we're looking for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=971.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roy Bellison, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=978.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=981.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=996.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1007.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1012.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1024.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1031.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if in fact they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design, and then later construction documents, which would then lead to an actual implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1051.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at this point, all we're asking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1053.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team to review what we have at our schools and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1068.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a very proactive thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1069.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1076.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1090.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1097.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1108.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1113.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1123.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with that, I just ask that the City Council<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1126.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: approve what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we can have the state share the cost of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1142.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1173.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are two programs at MSBA that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1178.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is called Accelerated Repair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1181.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not the program we're applying under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1183.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the core program for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1190.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are priorities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1191.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1195.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1201.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible and see what their interest level is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1213.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers, okay, at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1220.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1225.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1230.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at Medford High School, it goes back to 1970.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1232.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's clear that this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1238.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that the roof was replaced in 2001.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1242.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that at some point in time, the roof is going to need<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it's five, six years out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1247.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1253.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that the vocational school is moving into very high-tech areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1259.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state-of-the-art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1269.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anything that moves the show forward<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1272.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: enables us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1279.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another example would be the floor tiles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1281.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1285.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, they're not dangerous because they're not friable, but you can't pick them up without an abatement, and an abatement costs a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1293.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1302.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1306.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1314.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are some things that might actually fly through and we'd like to find out what they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1319.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1326.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding, which would be necessary to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1332.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Technology is another major area, with testing now being done on computers, with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1338.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: reporting all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1350.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's an area that might be of interest to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1353.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly would move forward with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1354.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've also applied or will apply under the e-rate program, the universal libraries program, and we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1364.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are things that we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1366.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to advance our possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1369.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1375.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1385.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1413.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the SOI includes everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1416.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The SOI just simply talks about everything possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1420.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1428.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1437.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fire alarm system, these are things, the roof, these are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1445.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have a very solid building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1448.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a building that needs to be replaced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1451.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't buy a CMU building anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1455.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with the kind of money out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1457.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somerville is, what, $250 million to replace a building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1461.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minuteman is $155 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1463.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Waltham's looking at a couple hundred million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1466.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not going to spend that kind of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1467.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1480.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's sort of what we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1482.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1486.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1497.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's on here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1498.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1518.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That it references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1521.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1533.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those are one, the last two pages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1546.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: March 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1547.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, my address is March 17th, mine's March 16th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1581.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1582.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1586.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are the things you're going to do yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1588.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1636.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First we want to know who's going to join with us on what projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1639.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1649.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because otherwise, you know, we have a plan that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1652.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: might avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1660.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1670.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1675.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can keep it on the boards, but once they determine it's eligible, we can go back and apply for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1680.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1720.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It really depends on what they determine eligibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1724.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somerville, when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1729.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1730.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we're not, I don't think we're in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1734.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're looking at something much smaller than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1735.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1743.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1749.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at least we know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1751.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what our partners are willing to put up on the table so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1794.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the school committee had several meetings on this topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1797.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1805.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The major issues will be going forward at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1808.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school is now the oldest major building in our possession.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1814.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things I told the school committee, so I feel comfortable sharing it here, is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state-funded planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1834.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1839.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1844.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1852.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got some other grants out there they're looking for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1854.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposed for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1860.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1863.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1881.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2080.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me give you a couple of examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2082.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2091.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, at some point, if you're interested, the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2096.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take the locker rooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2099.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been up to the locker rooms at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2100.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2105.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The girls' locker room, it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2108.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of old things in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2110.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of old marble, old shower stalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2113.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot of empty space, unutilized space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2116.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That needs to be redone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2118.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2127.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same thing is true with the men's locker room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2131.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2132.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just these are the things that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2133.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2149.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know, let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2160.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think those are the kinds of cafeteria right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2163.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's three cafeterias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2164.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2180.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's critical because that's going to be up on the first floor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2183.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to be a restaurant for the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2185.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to tie into our partnerships with WIN, which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2193.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue generating activities that will support other programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2201.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will free up space where Cafe Elector is now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2204.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can do some other things with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2205.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2212.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2217.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have to give them the big cavern that they had because they don't use that anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2222.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not what printing is about anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2224.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Dr. Riccio, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2230.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: putting programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2243.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2248.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That creates great opportunities for our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2250.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2253.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2258.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2261.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2267.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue, possibly projecting over two or three years a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2277.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2285.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are ways that I think we're moving forward, and I believe that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2290.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Looking at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2298.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plan, recognizing we've got to come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2302.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not voting for money tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2303.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're voting for planning tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2305.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2308.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what we were asking you to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2309.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2382.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we become eligible, we would then petition MSBA for the feasibility, a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for, or with, and they would reimburse us<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2400.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At the same rate, they would reimburse the construction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2403.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2410.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We lay it out, but they reimburse us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2413.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2415.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2433.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2439.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Earlier this evening I heard you talking, you want to consider options, well you want to know who's going to pay for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2443.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 7-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 7-0.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2479.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2491.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2576.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I can't tell you that because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2583.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2588.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2594.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some things that they would say, that's your problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2597.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all good questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2734.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Personally, I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2742.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2746.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Personally, I don't think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2747.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2753.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2760.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2764.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think that's an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2766.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2880.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2884.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's to get you into an exploration process and to find out what the state is willing to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2890.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you put down everything to talk about,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2892.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2899.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2901.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2911.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Different things emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2912.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People want to talk about them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2914.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that, you know, we put it down so that we could explore them with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2922.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2926.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2934.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll merge the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2936.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2940.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And any amount that we're going to spend, you're going to prioritize along with the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2944.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not going to be the superintendent who makes the final call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2947.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The superintendent might make a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2949.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you're going to decide, and the mayor's going to decide, and the school committee's going to decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2957.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2962.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2967.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know what the relative things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2969.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state's not going to commit to something before they see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2972.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible, because I know what the economics are between the different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2979.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't mean that it won't go down a little bit, because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3067.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying, but I'm<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3070.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3073.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, we've had science labs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3074.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've built new buildings and so on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3076.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3081.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll look at whether any of these other things are possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3086.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they know the difference between a firearm system and a roof and a cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3092.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They know the difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3093.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they know where we would like to go first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3096.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3099.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: who was involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together, a chance to be heard, rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3110.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're giving them a chance to be heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3111.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3176.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, you sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3187.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3192.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3199.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, we're giving them all these things, and they might say, you know, we're doing something with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3205.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3208.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we put it in front of them, and we got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3212.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you have to try all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3214.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You put it in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3215.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You say, are you interested in this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3216.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could you consider this to be a reasonable investment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3220.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3225.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're moving forward with a planning process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3228.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3237.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is going to take probably two to three years to actually actualize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3242.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the meantime, that will inform, you know, our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3249.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3254.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, and then grant applications we make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3256.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If someone were to say we can't get grants for this, you know, for example, we built the, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3264.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3267.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we got a grant to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3269.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to know where we have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3271.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3276.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can then lay it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3277.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money that's going to be needed to move the project forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3286.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3290.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3295.048s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3302.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we look forward to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3328.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, because I don't know, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3330.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the extent to which any of these things would be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3336.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the actual cost of your SOI request?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3338.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I wouldn't want to, you know, give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3346.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe not all, maybe all doors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3355.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we, you know, we can do that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3357.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we get back from a planning process,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3360.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we get to a financial phase, then we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3364.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3369.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3418.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3430.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all, just like anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3431.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We come to you with a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3432.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We come to you with other kinds of financial things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3434.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can tell us how much more you want to put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3437.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3442.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You are going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3443.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, who's going to pay for it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3445.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3452.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know that there are some heating things that we want to do at the high school that we should do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3457.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3460.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we should find out if we have a partner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3462.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3464.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We know that technology is moving at a rapid rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3468.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we know that it's going to be expensive to increase all the technology that's going to be required of public schools,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3474.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if someone's willing to partner with us, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3478.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3479.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That gives you those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3480.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can decide that, you know, I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3489.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3496.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My job is to give you options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3498.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3648.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3654.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: construction going on something, any project that gets approved and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3657.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3665.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3674.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3679.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reality is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3755.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're at such an early stage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3757.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3759.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3765.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on policies, on zoning, on any number of issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3769.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3786.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3792.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that I consider to be, that they consider to be important to them, because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3800.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent, and sometimes you have to make the tough decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3805.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I like the participation of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3807.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have to make all the decisions myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3809.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3815.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing's going to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3816.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're trying to explore who wants to partner with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3821.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3826.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3832.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3833.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3840.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly, you're going to face a roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3842.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you're going to face technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3844.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3848.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3852.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: before we get funding, and if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that, we talk about these things, and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3866.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get in the game, and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3872.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we need to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3873.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's my job to put it in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3875.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3893.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3898.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How come they're not part of the SOI?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3900.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because they're part of the general building envelope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3902.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's something that we can talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3903.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're part of the plumbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3905.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're part of the heating system, believe it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3907.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all part of the same consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3909.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3916.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3921.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3942.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk stuff, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3944.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can talk with them about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3945.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe they'll let us add, maybe they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3947.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4039.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess I'm a stakeholder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4041.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That would be my addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4042.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4049.741s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4054.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4066.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can go back and forth on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4113.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for the record, I'm going to tell you the high school is a safe place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4117.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's always more we can do to improve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4120.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4696.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that the school committee<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4698.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: would meet to talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4700.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4705.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4710.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're not going to meet for another two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4712.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I think that that slows this down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4714.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is due in a very short period of time into the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4718.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4722.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4726.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think you should allow us to go forward and to get this going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4730.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it doesn't hurt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4731.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not committing anything in terms of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4735.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4744.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4748.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They won't even get to us for a short period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4751.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, we have to be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4753.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because there are other communities going to submit as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4756.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're not in, we don't get any consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4760.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4768.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think you should stop it tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4850.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I certainly have no problem with any of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4851.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4854.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4861.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4867.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4874.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that that's a good thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4876.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think we should stop getting in on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4882.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: into the state with this so we can continue to move and get them to come out to us sooner rather than later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4887.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because everybody's going to be submitting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4889.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen until August, September, October, whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4977.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4981.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'm not a rookie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4983.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4991.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I respect that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4993.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4996.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Know your options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5104.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5105.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, just one quick thing to counsel, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5109.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just that we did an infrared study of the high school roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5112.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5118.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, that's about all we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5120.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5127.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, if we were to take it to the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5129.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5131.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5143.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5148.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mr. President, if I could just respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5296.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I feel I have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5298.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The document you're referring to in September was a different document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5301.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the capital plan that came from the mayor through the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5305.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee of the whole meeting that they had the week before on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5314.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you received it, what do you call it, tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5318.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because, what do you call it, you were busy dealing with other capital considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so they confused those two items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5326.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that that's the two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5330.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5334.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We filled out the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5336.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't add to the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5337.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be happy to provide that priority list to them, but the form is the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5342.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what you submit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5344.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't add things to an application that is not required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5347.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5355.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly, we respect the right that the council has asked, and we certainly will honor that, to come up with a priority list, provide it to you, and provide it to MSBA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5364.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as part of the discussions that take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5366.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5367.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Councilor Dello Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5405.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5465.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MSBA opens up a window for statements of interest in January and then expects it to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5473.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: follow through by the April date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5475.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They actually pushed it out a little bit this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5477.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Normally it's in March, but they open up the window for the SOIs in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6372.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As amended, Mr. Belson, do you want to finish up with anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6375.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to finish a couple of quick statements, if I may, with your permission.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6379.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, some of the things that were quoted were quoted as the priorities of the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6386.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When they say the building structurally unsound, that's not what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6390.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the state is using as a category for things that you can put things under.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6395.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the building says that the renovation of schools such as roofs, that's what they're saying you can ask for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6400.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not what we're saying is our need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6403.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the first thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6404.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as handicapped accessibility, we put in three elevators, ramps, we've made the Little Theater or the Karen Theater now handicapped accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6412.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The building is handicapped accessible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6414.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of things, and with all due respect to, I understand there's a give and take here, but the reality is that a lot of improvements have been made to that high school and that technical school, and you have helped to pay for it over the years as a city council and as a school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6428.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee had a right, when this thing came out, to deliberate and determine what it considered to be important and to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6437.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they had a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6438.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they then had a follow-up meeting where they voted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6442.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6443.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all we're asking is for you to allow us to submit it so we can then begin a process of finding out what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6450.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can have a more robust interactive process between council, school committee, mayor, administration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6457.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to determine what this city considers important, what this city wants to fund on its own, what this city wants to partner with, and what we're going to do in what time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6466.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's all we're looking for tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=806.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor Burke, members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=809.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=811.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's the head of the department which oversees the Ethics Bowl team and the Ethics Bowl team is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=818.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been very successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=820.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They won the Tufts, they won the regional, and now they have an opportunity to go to the nationals and compete with 23 other school systems across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=831.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I wanted to give this report, and then we'll make arrangements possibly to send the team to Chapel Hill to come back with a trophy for Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1549.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Members of the committee, Thomas Sutherland, the husband of Jean Barry Sutherland, would like to make a major donation to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1560.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Columbus school area site, uh, in memory and in honor of, uh, former principal, Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1567.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the gift would be a bench and a plaque to be installed on the Columbus ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1572.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we recommend that you accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1573.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Sutherland is here, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1576.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, no, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1577.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1663.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as we get into this time of year, people ask the question frequently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1670.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When will school start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1671.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What will be the vacation periods and the like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1673.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a draft that requires your approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1677.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm gonna call on our deputy superintendent to go over the particulars and to tell you why we picked certain dates the way we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1861.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1862.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By rule, with the Department of Ed, we have to make allowance for five days, but we actually have another seven days if we needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1869.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we really have 12 days available to us, not counting if we were to reclaim a professional day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1874.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So remember, if the last day with five days is the 20th of June, you still got to the 30th of June if we actually needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1881.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've really built in quite a bit of protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1898.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can put a one-liner in the notice out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1924.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, we should do five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1925.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We built in probably 11 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1943.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can put a statement and should, you know, we require more days because of snow or other inclement weather or other reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2326.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So our deputy superintendent, our assistant superintendent have led the charge in putting this program together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2332.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done with a great deal of input from the teachers and others, and it's a lot of work involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2338.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, uh, congratulations to both of them putting together a very interesting day and let them tell you about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2750.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we begin the process now of looking at pre-budget reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2753.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight starts and we'll turn it over to our deputy superintendent to introduce this first report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3211.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3213.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: God, I take the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3215.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3224.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a meeting today on a number of issues, including certain elements of technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3230.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this came up and the feeling was, is that the teachers are making,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3233.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very, very good progress in most instances using school brains to report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3239.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing is 100%, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3241.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'll try to get a better, more definitive report for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3579.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think any program can be moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3581.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And really, principals have to weigh in as to whether they believe it would be effective for them or whether they want to do something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3588.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Andrews uses things like Study Island and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3591.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we want to give principals some degree of autonomy to make decisions that they believe are in the best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3598.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could very well be that they adopt something from another school that they believe would work for them too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3603.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll check into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3604.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3605.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3630.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me check on it to make sure that I understand what really isn't working or what is slower than might be desired or<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3639.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, an upgrade or whatever the case may be, but we'll certainly give you a report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4546.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4549.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, on February 22nd, 2017, the federal government, using an executive order from the president, rescinded guidance and determined that Title IX's prohibition on gender identity discrimination was null and void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4567.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The president took the position that the protection of transgender rights should be left to each state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4575.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts law already protects the rights of transgender students in schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4581.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 199 of the Acts of 2011 went into effect in July 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4586.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee approved a local policy affirming the Massachusetts law on April 11, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4594.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had taken a previous position on the 13th in 2013, but we updated in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4597.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packet, you have information from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4605.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mike Long, who is the legal counsel to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4610.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have guidance from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4615.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have your own policy, the Medford Public Schools Policy, that was adopted in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4620.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have some guidance from the MTA, the Largest Teachers Union, and you have a copy of the bills that were enacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4629.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, in Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4633.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And clearly, throughout Massachusetts, transgender rights are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4640.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes federal laws supersede, but not in this instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4645.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because in this instance, the executive order said, let the states decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4652.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this instance, the state has decided, and we have an active plan in place<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4657.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at this point, we have really no problems with what we've done and what we're doing in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4664.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to bring you up to date on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4667.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to, if I can, Mayor, also comment on the immigration rules, because I believe that's also tied to equal access to education, which is part of the same vein of thinking as the transgender rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4685.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you an advisory from Mara Healy, the Massachusetts Attorney General, on equal access to public education for all students, irrespective of immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4699.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized Brown versus Board of Education, and it is true today as it was back in 1953.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4714.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The advisory that the Attorney General has provided you is very, very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4719.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There has been a case in Massachusetts, Filer v. Doe, in 1982, where the Supreme Court held that public elementary and secondary schools may not deny any child residing in the applicable jurisdiction access to public education, whether the child is present in the country legally or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4742.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Filer made it clear that a child's immigration or citizenship status, or that his or her parents are guarding, is not relevant to the child's right to a public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4754.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, irrespective of any rulings that come down, Massachusetts law, states rights,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4763.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: made the decision that we will accept anyone who resides in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4768.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will not ask them what their status is, visa or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4772.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will not pursue anything other than the fact they are not living in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4778.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they're not living in the community, it's a residence issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4781.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they're living in the community, whether they're living with their parents or they're residing with some other responsible adult,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4788.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we will provide them free and public access to our educational system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4793.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to clarify that I am not allowed to ask what a person's visa status is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4799.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not allowed to ask what their immigrant status is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4802.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not allowed to ask for some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4805.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact, in some instances, there are people that are homeless, and I might have to accept that just simply based on homelessness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4813.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just had a webinar today on homelessness that dealt with foster children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4817.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: More guidance is coming out on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4820.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make it clear that we're an equal opportunity school system, whether it's transgender or immigrant status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4827.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster resides in our community, they're entitled to free access to our public education system, and that's the way we will treat them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4837.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4871.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An automated defibrillator, or an AED, is a medical device that will analyze heart rhythms and can deliver electric shocks to help a heart reestablish an effective rhythm during a sudden cardiac arrest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4885.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The American Red Cross recommends that AEDs be readily available and applied within four minutes of cardiac arrest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4893.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, under this law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4895.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to have trained people on staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4897.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4897.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have nurses, we've trained our coaches, and we'll train even more people to use these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4905.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, we will have a moment of silence from somebody who could have used one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4912.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4915.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good to know that we're ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4917.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have them in every school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4919.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll review them to see whether or not we should be adding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4923.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have had good fortune working with our ambulance providers and others who have donated equipment to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4929.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They get checked every day for battery effectiveness, and we have to keep that up because you never know when the equipment's there, but the battery doesn't operate, so you have to check this on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4941.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have to continuously train people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4944.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure you're aware that we're in compliance with this law well in advance of its implementation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4949.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's obviously more work that we will do to make this a more efficient and effective system for utilization should it be necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4976.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be brought by coaches and trainers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4979.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have them available on the fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5013.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important to recognize that I don't want people who are afraid to use this thing to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5020.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want people only who are comfortable using it to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5023.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who... Who are certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5025.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, and certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5025.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there are some people who would be very uncomfortable taking this device off the wall and using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5032.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every building will have people, and we can provide you with a list of who's trying to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5112.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to be careful that we have sufficient numbers, but that we don't put people in situations of doing things that we're uncomfortable doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5121.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very different than an EpiPen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5123.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of people can use an EpiPen very effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5134.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5134.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to make it clear that this isn't one of those things like CPR that everyone is going to be trained in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5140.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's something that you really want to make sure that the four or five people in the building who are the go-to people are the people that are really comfortable using a device like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5149.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very sophisticated device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5171.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know that, but I will check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5172.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know that, but I'm told by Tony Vento that they check them every day and that's their, one of their responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5180.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5181.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could it be that one day went by when they didn't entirely possible, but we will certainly reinforce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5186.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to make sure that, you know, the people that use this know what they're doing, but we'll provide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5231.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Four minutes is the guideline from the point of which the heart stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5236.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not for the person starting to feel chest pain or starting to feel dizzy or things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5243.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5244.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, you know, we have a 500,000 square foot high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5249.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5249.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And things can happen anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5251.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, you know, our goal is to get people to the scene as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5257.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Same thing with CPR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5258.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Same thing with any other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5260.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with EpiPens, anything that requires a medical intervention to get them there as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5265.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll go over it with Tony and with other people and see exactly if we can give you more specifics as to how they would respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5342.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll sit with Tony, and let's go over a list of people who are more likely to be available and capable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5350.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll approach them and try to add to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5354.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's unlikely that we're going to be able to get every person in every corner, nor should we try, because I think inappropriate application is more dangerous than none at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5425.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked for a report that broke it out by actual classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5429.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that report in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5430.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was appended to the previous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5433.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It shows you what each teacher has as of the same date that the previous report was provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5438.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5520.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster comes from a substantially separated class, they come with the teachers or the staff that's with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5526.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these numbers could, during the day... A number could increase mostly for gym or for some of the larger<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5532.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: activities, but certainly not for classes that are substantially contained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5543.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although occasionally a youngster may try, they may try to put a youngster in a class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5551.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing you got to keep in mind is on any given day, you know, with not to say that we encourage this, but any given day, a hundred percent of the pupils aren't always in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5562.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 20 youngsters in the class, you might have 18 on a given day, you know, on that day and then another day you might have all 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5568.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just depends on who's there on any given day as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5764.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just so we have one understanding that we have to have all the time, I never send anything to the civil city council like this until you get it first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5771.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5772.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5773.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may be a little bit of a wait sometimes when they ask for something like this, but you always get it first before they get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5781.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5781.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we send it through the council just so you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5795.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this policy was in front of you earlier and we took it back to review it to make sure there were no situations that we were missing using current, you know, let's say legal opinions that were out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5810.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We vetted it at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5812.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that this is ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5814.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5840.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5841.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When a person gets in the States, they sign off on the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5850.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look on the cover page, all users must sign off on the reasonable use policy each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5911.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: then we'll work on distribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5979.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The unions to come in and work with us until they're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5981.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't, I can't, we should expect something very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6011.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm just going to answer what I answered before until the hall straightens out the accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6016.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to give you a report where commingled money is, it can't be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6020.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can't be separated out so I can actually give you an accurate report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6023.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6024.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have major changes in the financial administration of the city and major change in the financial administration of the schools, and they're working on that right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6033.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would hope to have it soon, but as late as last week, I'm down there talking to the people in the city hall trying to get that broken out so we can give you an accurate report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6043.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The good news is that we're not in jeopardy of anything financial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6047.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The bad news is, what do you call it, I'm still trying to get this separated out so that you can see each account very cleanly as opposed to having four or five accounts somehow consolidated together which doesn't give you a real picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6086.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Soon as it, as soon as I get the numbers, the way they should be given to me, I will be happy to give you the report and I hope it's soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6186.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to thank Anne-Marie Cugno and the Italian Consul General, Nicola De Santis, for Italian Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6194.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was a great event up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6197.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was exciting, and the youngsters enjoyed sitting in the Ferrari and the Maserati and listening to La Traviata and maybe sampling some food from Italy to getting a sense of Italian culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6212.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it was a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6213.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dovetailed with the science fair, with a few other things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6216.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with Dr. Seuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6217.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot going on in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6219.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a March handout from Lisa, which gives you some activities in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6227.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6229.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't make everything, but the ones you can make, it's worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6233.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of good things going on in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6235.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in our next meeting, there'll be a number of other presentations to students who have achieved some exciting things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6242.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we want to recognize them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6245.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in public and we will do that on our meeting on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6250.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good stuff going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6252.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You did get a handout tonight from the actual presentation by the governor on Friday of the $495,000 grant for the culinary arts and the hospitality program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6265.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expect another major announcement coming up this week, possibly later this week or early next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6271.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another major grant which dovetails with our SOI<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6275.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, requests and other requests of, uh, for funding for capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6279.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, we'll be working on when we go to the council fairly soon and, uh, we'll get back to you and let you know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6295.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you also have something on middle school mathematics night pathways to high school mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6301.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: important because a lot of people aren't sure of how the progression of courses take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6307.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that this is a good opportunity for people to become aware of that so that there's no misunderstanding of what a youngster can take for coursework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=693.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor Burke, members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=696.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=698.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's the head of the department, which oversees the Ethics Bowl team and the Ethics Bowl team is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=705.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been very successful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=707.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They won the Tufts, they won the regional, and now they have an opportunity to go to the nationals and compete with 23 other school systems across the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=717.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I wanted to give this report, and then we'll make arrangements possibly to send the team to Chapel Hill to come back with a trophy from Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1436.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Members of the committee, Thomas Sutherland, the husband of Jean Barry Sutherland, would like to make a major donation to Columbus School area site in memory and in honor of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1452.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: former principal, Jean Barry Sutherland.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1455.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, the gift would be a bench and a plaque to be installed on the Columbus ground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1459.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we recommend that you accept it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1460.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Sutherland is here, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1463.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1463.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1463.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1464.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1550.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as we get into this time of year, people ask the question frequently,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1557.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When will school start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1558.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When will be the vacation periods and the like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1561.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a draft that requires your approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1564.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm gonna call on our deputy superintendent to go over the particulars and to tell you why we picked certain dates the way we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1748.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me just answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1749.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By rule, with the Department of Ed, we have to make<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1753.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: allowance for five days, but we actually have another seven days if we needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1756.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we really have 12 days available to us, not counting if we were to reclaim a professional day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1761.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So remember, if the last day with five days is the 20th of June, you still got to the 30th of June if we actually needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1768.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've really built in quite a bit of protection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1785.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can put a one-liner in the notice out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1811.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should do five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1812.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We built in probably 11 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=1830.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can put a statement and should, you know, we require more days because of snow or other inclement weather or other reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2213.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So our deputy superintendent, our assistant superintendent have led the charge in putting this program together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2219.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's done with a great deal of input from the teachers and others, and it's a lot of work involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2225.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So congratulations to both of them putting together a very interesting day and let them tell you about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2637.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we begin the process now of looking at pre-budget reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=2640.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight starts and we'll turn it over to our deputy superintendent to introduce this first report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3098.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3100.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: God, I take the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3102.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3111.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we had a meeting today on a number of issues, including certain elements of technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3117.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this came up and the feeling was, is that the teachers are making,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3120.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: very, very good progress in most instances using school brains to report out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3126.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing is 100%, I'm sure, but I'll try to get a better, more definitive report for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3466.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think any program can be moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3468.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And really, principals have to weigh in as to whether they believe it would be effective for them or whether they want to do something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3475.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Andrews uses things like Study Island and other things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3478.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we want to give principals some degree of autonomy to make decisions that they believe are in the best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3485.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could very well be that they adopt something from another school that they believe would work for them, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3490.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll check into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3491.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3492.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=3517.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me check on it to make sure that I understand what really isn't working or what is slower than might be desired or, you know, an upgrade or whatever the case may be, but we'll certainly give you a report back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4433.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor, members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4436.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, on February 22nd, 2017, the federal government, using an executive order from the president, rescinded guidance and determined that Title IX's prohibition on gender identity discrimination was null and void.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4454.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The president took the position that the protection of transgender rights should be left to each state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4462.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts law already protects the rights of transgender students in schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4468.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 199 of the Acts of 2011 went into effect in July 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4473.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford School Committee approved a local policy affirming the Massachusetts law on April 11, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4481.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had taken a previous position on the 13th in 2013, but we updated in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4484.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packet, you have information from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4492.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mike Long, who is the legal counsel to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4497.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have guidance from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4502.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have your own policy, the Medford Public Schools policy that was adopted in 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4507.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have some guidance from the MTA, the Largest Teachers Union, and you have a copy of the bills that were enacted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4516.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, in Medford,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4520.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And clearly, throughout Massachusetts, transgender rights are protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4527.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes federal laws supersede, but not in this instance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4532.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because in this instance, the executive order said, let the states decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4539.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this instance, the state has decided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4541.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have an active plan in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4544.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at this point, we have really no problems with what we've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4549.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and what we're doing in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4551.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to bring you up to date on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4554.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to, if I can, Mayor, also comment on the immigration rules, because I believe that's also tied to equal access to education, which is part of the same vein of thinking as the transgender rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4572.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you an advisory from Mara Healy, the Massachusetts Attorney General,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4577.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on equal access to public education for all students, irrespective of immigration status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4586.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized Brown versus Board of Education, and it is true today as it was back in 1953.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4598.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The advisory that the Attorney General has provided you is very, very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4606.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There has been a case in Massachusetts, Filer v. Doe, in 1982, where the Supreme Court held that public elementary and secondary schools may not deny any child residing in the applicable jurisdiction access to public education, whether the child is present in the country legally or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4629.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Filer made it clear that a child's immigration or citizenship status, or that his or her parents<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4636.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our guardian is not relevant to the child's right to a public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4641.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So irrespective of any rulings that come down, Massachusetts law, states rights, made the decision that we will accept anyone who resides in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4655.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will not ask them what their status is, visa or otherwise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4659.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will not pursue anything other than the fact they are not living in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4665.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they're not living in the community, it's a residence issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4668.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they're living in the community, whether they're living with their parents or they're residing with some other responsible adult, we will provide them free and public access to our educational system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4680.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to clarify that I am not allowed to ask what a person's visa status is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4686.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not allowed to ask what their immigrant status is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4689.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not allowed to ask for some of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4692.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4694.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some instances, there are people that are homeless, and I might have to accept that just simply based on homelessness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4700.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just had a webinar today on homelessness that dealt with foster children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4704.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: More guidance is coming out on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4707.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make it clear that we're an equal opportunity school system, whether it's transgender or immigrant status.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4714.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster resides in our community, they are entitled to free access to our public education system, and that's the way we will treat them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4724.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4745.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So effective July 1, 2018, all schools must have automated external defibrillators on site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4753.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The good news is we have them in every one of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4758.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: An automated defibrillator, or an AED, is a medical device that will analyze heart rhythms and can deliver electric shocks to help a heart reestablish an effective rhythm during a sudden cardiac arrest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4772.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The American Red Cross recommends that AEDs be readily available and applied within four minutes of cardiac arrest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4780.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, under this law,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4782.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to have trained people on staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4784.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4784.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have nurses, we've trained our coaches, and we'll train even more people to use these items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4791.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, we will have a moment of silence from somebody who could have used one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4799.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, this is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4802.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's good to know that we're ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4804.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have them in every school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4806.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll review them to see whether or not we should be adding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4810.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have had good fortune working with our ambulance providers and others who have donated equipment to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4816.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They get checked every day for battery effectiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4820.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have to keep that up because you never know when the equipment's there, but the battery doesn't operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4826.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have to check this on a regular basis and we have to continuously train people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4831.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make sure you're aware that we're in compliance with this law well in advance of its implementation, but there's obviously more work that we will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4839.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to make this a more efficient and effective, uh, system for utilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4843.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should it be necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4863.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be brought by coaches and trainers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4865.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have them available on the fields.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4900.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's important to recognize that I don't want people who are afraid to use this thing to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4906.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want people only who are comfortable using it to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4909.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who- Who are certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4911.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, and certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4912.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some people who would be very uncomfortable taking this device off the wall and using it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4919.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every building will have people, and we can provide you with a list of who's trying to use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=4999.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to be careful that we have sufficient numbers, but that we don't put people in situations of doing things they're uncomfortable doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5008.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very different than an EpiPen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5010.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of people can use an EpiPen very effectively.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5020.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5021.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to make it clear that this isn't one of those things like CPR that everyone is going to be trained in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5027.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's something that you really want to make sure that the four or five people in the building who are the go-to people are the people that are really comfortable using a device like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5036.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very sophisticated device.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5057.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know that, but I will check that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5059.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know that, but I'm told by Tony Vento that they check them every day and that's their, one of their responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5067.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5068.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Could it be that one day went by when they didn't entirely possible, but we will certainly reinforce that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5073.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to make sure that, you know, the people that use this know what they're doing, but we'll provide that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5116.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, again, four minutes is the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5120.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: guideline from the point of which the heart stops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5123.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not when a person's starting to feel chest pain, or starting to feel dizzy, or things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5130.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's tricky.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5131.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, we have a 500,000 square foot high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5136.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And things can happen anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5138.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But obviously, our goal is to get people to the scene as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5144.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Same thing with CPR, same thing with any other, with EpiPens, anything that requires a medical intervention<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5150.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to get them there as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5152.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll go over it with Tony and with other people and see exactly if we can give you more specifics as to how they would respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5229.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll sit with Tony, and let's go over a list of people who are more likely to be available and capable, and then we'll approach them and try to add to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5242.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's unlikely that we're going to be able to get every person in every corner, nor should we try, because I think inappropriate application is more dangerous than none at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5312.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked for a report that broke it out by actual classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5316.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have that report in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5317.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was appended to the previous report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5320.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It shows you what each teacher has as of the same date that the previous report was provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5325.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5407.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a youngster comes from a substantially separated class, they come with the teachers or the staff that's with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5413.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these numbers could, during the day... The number could increase mostly for gym or for some of the larger<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5419.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: activities, but certainly not for classes that are substantially contained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5430.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Occasionally a youngster may try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5432.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may try to put a youngster in the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5433.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5438.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing you got to keep in mind is on a given day, you know, with not to say that we encourage this, but any given day, a hundred percent of the pupils aren't always in attendance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5448.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have 20 youngsters in a class, you might have 18 on a given day, you know, on that day and then another day you might have all 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5455.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it just depends on who's there on any given day as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5651.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just so we have one understanding that we have to have all the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5654.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I never send anything to the civil city council like this until you get it first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5658.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5659.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it may be a little bit of a weight sometimes when they ask for something like this, but you always get it first before they get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5668.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we send it through the council just so you understand the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5682.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this, uh, policy was in front of you, uh, earlier and we went, took it back to review it to make sure there were no situations that we were missing using current, you know, let's say legal opinions that were out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5697.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We vetted it at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5699.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that this is ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5701.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5727.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5728.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When a person gets in state, they sign off on the, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5737.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look on the cover page, all users must sign off on the reasonable use policy each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5795.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once you're approving it, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5798.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: then we work on distribution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5866.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The unions to come in and work with us until they're ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5868.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't, I can't push it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5870.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should expect something very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5898.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm just going to answer what I answered before until the hall straightens out the accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5903.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to give you a report where co-mingled money is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5906.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be, can't be separated out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5908.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I can actually give you an accurate report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5910.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5911.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have major changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5913.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The financial administration of the city and major change in the financial administration of the schools and they're working on that right now I would hope to have it soon But as late as last week, I'm down there talking to The people in the City Hall trying to get that broken out so we can give you an accurate report The good news is that we're not in jeopardy of anything financial<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5934.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The bad news is, what do you call it, I'm still trying to get this separated out so that you can see each account very cleanly as opposed to having four or five accounts somehow consolidated together, which doesn't give you a real picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5945.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=5973.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Soon as it, as soon as I get the numbers, the way they should be given to me, I will be happy to give you the report and I hope it's soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6073.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to thank Anne-Marie Cugno and the Italian Consul General Nicola De Santis for Italian Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6081.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was a great event up at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6084.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was exciting and the youngsters enjoyed sitting in the Ferrari and the Maserati and listening to La Traviata and maybe sampling some food from Italy to getting a sense of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6098.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Italian culture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6099.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it was a great day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6100.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dovetailed with the science fair, with a few other things going on with Dr. Seuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6104.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot going on in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6106.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a March handout from Lisa, which gives you some activities in March.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6114.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6116.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't make everything, but the ones you can make, it's worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6120.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of good things going on in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6122.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at our next meeting, there'll be a number of other presentations to students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6126.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: who have achieved some exciting things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6130.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we want to recognize them in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6133.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will do that on our meeting on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6137.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good stuff going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6139.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You did get a handout tonight from the actual presentation by the governor on Friday of the $495,000 grant for the culinary arts and the hospitality program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6152.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect another major announcement coming up this week, possibly later this week or early next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6158.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another major grant which dovetails with our SOI requests and other requests for funding for capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6166.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be working on when we go to the council fairly soon and we'll get back to you and let you know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6182.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you also have something on Middle School Mathematics Night, Pathways to High School Mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6188.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Important because a lot of people aren't sure of how the progression of courses take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/WSQLRgnxB8U&t=6194.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that this is a good opportunity for people to become aware of that so that there's no misunderstanding of what a youngster can take for coursework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=87.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another piece to that is that by contract, teachers may decline to administer certain medications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=94.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they don't have to accept that responsibility if they don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=115.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=425.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I would say is field trips differ in length and time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=429.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you had a person for an entire week, the cost would be much more extensive than if it were for two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=435.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the person had some severe issues, the cost of other things might be more substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=464.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I mean, I just, I think that you do, there's going to be a recognition that you're paying for something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=471.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And quite frankly,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=473.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: if you don't have some kind of distributive cost sharing, you're going to have to start denying certain field trips, because you have 10, 15 field trips, and you're going to be paying $2,000 for every one of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=483.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to have a budget line item that you're going to have to fund, or you may have to fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=498.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, I take your guidance on, you know, as a group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=500.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I personally don't think the third one is a bad one, but that's my opinion, because I think that, you know, the cost of a field trip, you never know when someone's going to need medical help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=510.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be anybody at any given time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=520.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a personal opinion, but certainly the committee can make that decision in all honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=576.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, we can take guidance from you and you can tell us what you prefer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=579.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I think that, you know, different field trips are going to cost different things anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=584.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The cost of Disney for the band is going to be one cost and the cost of Disney for the science trip is going to be another cost regardless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=590.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, again, it's your call and, you know, whatever wisdom you want to have us follow, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=727.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another factor is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=729.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We generally don't know the enrollment of the trip until we get pretty close to the event, because youngsters may change their mind, may not make the commitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=739.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And depending on when the trip is coming and when the cutoff date is, it may be a month before, a couple of months before, whatever it is, or it may be six months before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=748.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we may not know who's on the trip until we actually put the final enrollment on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=838.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a choice you make when you budget as to which things you'll fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=842.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=843.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=845.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you fund certain student activities and not others, you've made a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=848.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a choice you can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=851.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in your court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=852.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we'll do whatever we're asked to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=854.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just giving you the options that we think are the most practical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=859.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Mrs. Vandekoot's raised another one, and, you know, we can add that to the mix of possible alternatives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=873.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, I'm just going to throw one more thing out, if I can, you know, which is, you know, insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=879.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we had this discussion last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=881.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, some people will take the insurance, and some people will not take the insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=887.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Individually, all of us have flown on an airplane, and sometimes we've taken insurance, and sometimes we've not taken insurance to cover the cost of a trip that might have to change because of circumstances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=898.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as another example, there are variables built into all of these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=903.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some trips, you know, individuals will ask for other things that others don't need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=929.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2852.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The A building area has had ongoing issues for a long period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2858.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we went in there to diagnostically try to fix a few things, and we found that every time we fixed something, it got a little worse and a little bit worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2866.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we decided to go in there and really just do a good job and try to clean it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2870.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it isn't a big urgency thing, but it's an expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2876.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the kind of thing we can fix.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2878.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It requires things, I think, going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2880.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should be part of the capital plan thinking as we go, but it's definitely an item that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2886.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, taking a few dollars out of our repair budget this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2893.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's repaired at this point in time, but you know, I think we may spring another leap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2897.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who knows, as the winter season's coming, it's very hard to know, you know, whether that's going to happen, but we've repaired it to the point that we need to right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2908.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2983.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I'm not sure, you know, everything has an exact dollar amount yet because there's still some work going on, but I think we're in excess of $25,000 at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2992.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that how much more we have to spend will depend on what actually takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2996.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What I said a few moments ago, I think is accurate, is that we're now doing an assessment to determine, you know, how much of this needs to go into a full capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3004.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think that a building is an area that probably is going to need a lot of attention because, I don't know if you know the piping structure, but you know the flooring is terrazzo tile?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3016.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3016.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to go into the terrazzo tile and go down under into the tunnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3021.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That alone is an expense, and that alone is a major activity, and then go down and in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3028.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To replace that piping is almost like ripping up a straight Winthrop street, taking out the thing, and then putting a pipe in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3033.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think in the long run, going into the capital plan, we're going to want to replace those pipes, because I think they're going to keep happening from now on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3044.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's the way we're going to look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3046.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're making this as more of a capital look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3053.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think the capital plan will start to roll out in the next couple of months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3063.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There could be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3063.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3064.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3065.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on a given day, you could walk in and, you know, we could have another pipeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3068.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did last year, for example, you remember up in B building, in the second floor, there were several pipes that broke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3075.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3075.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3076.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, this is part of, you know, the cold winter and also<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3080.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: part of the structure of that building where some of the stuff is a little bit older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3084.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So part of our capital planning will be to look at these weak areas and try to strengthen them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3154.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll refer that to Mr. DeLaver and get a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3199.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which room is it, do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3338.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, so let me just answer it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3340.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Reconciliation at the City Hall has to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3343.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have the full reconciliation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3345.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to give you a report that I don't have a reconciliation yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3348.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think from our internal documents that we're fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3352.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But until, what do you call it, the money is moved properly, you know, I can't give you a reconciliation against the city's chart of accounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3359.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we'll do that, and if necessary, we'll provide you our report, you know, with a disclaimer at the end of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3402.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think going forward it will be easier simply because we've got a new operation down the hall and up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3408.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once that's cleaned up one time and set, then we can do that with more confidence going forward every quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3416.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, you know, there's stuff that's still moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3428.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3431.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As soon as the auditors are done, I'll be happy to give you a date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3490.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are still some people who do not go online and give us checks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3495.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they walk in the door and they want to go swimming, and they give us a check or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3499.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the most part, most people are using the online system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3503.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are some, as far as vendors go, they're using an online system with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3507.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that some people still walk in the door and hand us a check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3785.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Primarily, that's the middle school bus in the afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3790.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, the two or three days that you've asked for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3793.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3815.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you anticipate a cost, you put that amount in there to say that that money is pretty much committed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3821.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you pay it down, you liquidate the amount that's been paid out so that the encumbrance decreases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3828.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes the liquidation is slower than the actual expenditure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3892.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3897.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: item out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4494.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are a couple of things we've just got to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4497.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: First of all, we have to stay compliant with the fact the federal government will give us a certain amount of money per student on free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4506.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we ask our paid students to pay less,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4508.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: federal government's comeback is that we are subsidizing students who are not eligible for a free or reduced meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4516.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to at least meet that in order to stay in compliance, because otherwise the government's saying, well, we're paying you for students who can afford to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4524.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4525.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second piece that we've got to keep in mind is that the U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4529.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Department of Agriculture has got a new administration in Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4535.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Recent signals are they're looking to make cuts in agencies like USDA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4539.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they're making cuts in USDA, that could reduce the subsidies coming back to states, could reduce the commodities and the like, and we could get through the back door for less availabilities to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4551.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got to keep that in mind too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4553.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And three, we are in the process, we've had some discussions about negotiating with our cafeteria workers and what we've planned for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4563.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: modest as it is, will impact this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4566.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we don't plan for that, we will drive our program off the, you know, off the balance sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4572.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's several things going on and you know, no one likes to see price increases, but on the other hand, we're trying to be realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4631.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 30, 36, 36 times five is 180 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4635.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4660.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we're not against you taking action tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4662.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4663.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you need more time to think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4799.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can certainly do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4800.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, I think it's, it's always informative to learn about all the things going on, but from a financial standpoint, this report was developed in conjunction with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4812.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just learning about nutrition and learning about what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4816.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4816.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can always send it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4817.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's been a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4961.99s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent calling upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5395.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5395.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll put that as part of the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5399.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be some efficiencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5456.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just to give you a little quick update on this because the governor will be speaking tomorrow night And there will be releases of the state budget His proposed budget and then the process will begin and so just to keep you informed as to what goes on because this is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5472.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What happens at the state level obviously impacts us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5476.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the governor is going to be speaking tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5481.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somewhere in the next little while, you will get some more details on that presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5488.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But on January 13th, the Senate, the House, and the governor agreed on a revenue distribution, which is 3.9%, or approximately $1.02 billion more into next year from<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5503.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: taxation and other revenues from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5507.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is what we call a consensus budget guideline to help them produce budgets in each chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5514.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The thing you have to understand is that you can project 3.9% increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5520.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year they projected 4.3.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5522.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But to get to that number, they probably have to increase the revenue by even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5527.444s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll guess that to about 5.5%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5530.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: something along that kind of line, because there are tax cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5534.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other things that are one-time revenues that we used that won't be used again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5539.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So even though they project that, they're now going to have to resolve what they've lost from revenue from the previous year or what they will lose with programs that maybe need more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5550.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in our budget, for example, as salaries go up, you know, that factors into the increase in what we need to come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5560.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5561.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are at least six major factors you need to pay attention to going through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5565.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is how much money the FY 2017 budget was dependent upon as temporary and one-time revenues that won't be available in fiscal 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5573.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How much temporary money did they use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5577.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, what accounts were underfunded in 2017?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5580.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things that they short-funded and they have to provide a supplemental to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5585.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they may need more money in 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5588.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the actual cost of providing current service levels in fiscal 18?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5594.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not more, current service levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5597.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What will be the actual growth in revenues for fiscal 2018?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5599.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Will there be new sources of sustainable revenue, not just one-time revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5604.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, for example,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5607.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if marijuana or other things like that were out there, there's money coming in, there's gambling issues, there's things like that that may generate hotel revenues, meal tax.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5615.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As things come in, we have to watch all of that stuff to see exactly what goes into the state coffers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5621.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What new initiatives, projects will be approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5625.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to do something they've never done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5628.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All of a sudden, that's a new program that has to be funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5630.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or maybe it won't be funded, and it'll be sent down to us to fund, placing new demands on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5636.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What previously funded items will be dropped or diminished?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5642.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What will be the impact of a new administration in Washington?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5645.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What states will gain or lose resource or policy changes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5649.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medicaid, Medicare.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5651.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the way it's funded, the way it's done, health care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5654.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All these things are going to have to be phased in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5656.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor's already talking about making some serious changes in health care, you were probably there, which could alter it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5662.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The GIC numbers are coming to us now, and they're looking for more deductibles and other factors, premium increases that will affect teachers and possibly affect, and other employees, and possibly affect what we have to budget for our percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5678.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all those things have to come into from a state budget, so we're looking at this stuff now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5683.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll be at the center of our concerns, but any adverse state effect on the municipal budget as well, things that affect the municipal side of the budget, has an impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5694.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The mayor's got one whole budget to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5698.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want what we want, he's gonna look at the whole city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5701.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that could be something that impacts us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5705.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 70 allocations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5707.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor was talking about $95 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5710.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He thinks that's new money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5712.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That, to us, is no new money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5715.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's like $20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5716.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year, we got $55.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5718.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's well below what the foundation-level budget review committees were proposing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5722.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's not doing us much good unless it gets better on the foundation level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5728.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are a hold-harmless district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5731.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because of where we are, we're going to get a certain amount of money that we got last year, plus minimum aid, which could be anywhere from $20 to $55.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5739.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5742.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some other pockets, but, for example, last year, you know, you were concerned about the kindergarten money not coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5750.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things that may not come in, other budgets that could get sliced, we have to pay attention to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5754.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The sped circuit breaker is now being discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5757.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a legislative briefing on February 2nd or 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5760.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I forget which date it is exactly right now that I'll attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5763.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm part of that coalition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5765.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We typically get 75% above the threshold of four times foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5769.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But four times foundation goes up every year, so that means our eligibility gets shortchanged a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5776.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they don't give us 75%,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5778.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That affects what we can put into the pie for special needs, extraordinary tuitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5784.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So all those things are, you know, part of our calculus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5788.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charter school reimbursements have been underfunded for a number of years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5792.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't increase last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5794.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There won't be any major increase in the number of charter schools, but there will be some more charter schools because the state board is going to be discussing them in the next couple of weeks at their board meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5804.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the more you have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5806.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The more pupils that you have statewide, the more the distribution takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5810.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you only have the same pot of money, it gets spread out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5814.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll have to see where that takes that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5816.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We brought youngsters back to Medford last year, and we paid more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5821.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a tricky formula.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5823.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's got to be what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5824.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Out-of-district transportation costs for non-resident students to Minutemen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5830.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The reimbursement level came down again this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5833.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully it'll be sustained, but if that gets knocked out of the budget, it could be $20,000, $30,000 out of our pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5838.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Homeless funding has always been underfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5842.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The various grant programs, including early childhood, kindergarten, academic support, vocational education, and substance abuse prevention, the new opiate bill, it's not funded as far as I can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5852.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know who's funding that, but we all have responsibilities on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5856.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And will there be any new mandated programs that emerge from legislative deliberations?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5862.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a snapshot of some of the challenges ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5866.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to be aware of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5869.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't know, you know, all the facts right now, but this is the stuff that we'll process every week, every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5875.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I get newsletters and materials, speak to people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5878.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the kind of stuff I have to do on a regular basis to see what's likely to happen or not likely to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5884.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: superintendents, teachers, unions, all kinds of people will be in there lobbying to keep money at a certain level or to get more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5892.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they'll all be clashing with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5895.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the hard question is, is that what can happen that's new if the revenue growth is only at a certain level and one time revenues are either not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5906.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We always hear about the rainy day fund.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5907.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one likes to dip into that unless they absolutely have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5911.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, we don't know what capital gains will do for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5914.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, revenue into the city, I mean into state rather, all that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5917.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we also don't know what Washington will change in the next year and what it might affect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5923.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Although I think they're on a one year delay, it doesn't seem much change in some things through this year, but the year after it could have some impact on us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5932.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of factors for us to pay attention to, but I want to get you in the water and start you talking about it as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5956.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are other funds, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5957.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we've talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5958.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are funds that come from special sources, bond bills and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5962.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, for example, in our vocational, you've seen money come to us from certain grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5966.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of those things are independent of this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5969.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the things will be dependent on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5971.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So... Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5972.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=5978.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6005.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6005.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6006.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6102.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee of the whole meeting is Wednesday evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6105.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unfortunately, on the notice, we put Tuesday the 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6108.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6109.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6112.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6206.326s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6209.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One more announcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6212.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, so on Sunday, the 27th, there's community conversations in the afternoon in front of Caron Theater, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6220.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6220.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 29th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6221.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, Sunday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6224.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sunday afternoon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6225.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll get the dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6227.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 29th on Sunday afternoon, so it's from 2 to 4.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6230.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's an important activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6234.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also want to tell you that we'll put on the web, the students created a beautiful video on Martin Luther King Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6244.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to put that up there so you can look for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=6246.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a great tribute to them and their work and the way they express themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=140.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the estimates, you know, vary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=142.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It depends on what we decide should be the surface on those playgrounds, because we may not want to go with the same surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=149.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may want something different, something that maybe is a newer product than what we put in place 15, 16 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=157.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to get a better estimate on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=159.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=160.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While this may be an interesting opportunity, we're also looking at the community preservation grant for other issues as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=166.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward, generally for us in the second round, and I was going to give you some materials on that at a subsequent meeting, because the second round will be coming up as well, and to look at a larger picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=176.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think if we, since it's March 2nd, I think we put it on the table tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=181.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll come back with more specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=184.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and try to give you an idea of whether this is feasible under the Community Preservation Grant or whether it needs to go through some other process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=191.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's probably the best way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=193.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we're glad to get any funding we can get, appreciate your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=197.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But to do this right, this is not a $5,000 or $10,000 expenditure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=201.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This could be $75,000, $100,000, or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=204.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is not something that's going to be easily acquired from any one source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=356.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=356.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Wanted on the next agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=357.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has to happen in between now and the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=359.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So she has a March 2nd deadline to submit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=365.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=375.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Mayor and members of the committee, earlier in the minutes you heard that we approved retaining Massachusetts Association of School Committees to be our agent to advance the search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=386.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This afternoon, the Mayor and I met with Glenn Kuchar, the Executive Director of MASC, and went over all the different functions and activities that they can assist us with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=395.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's quite substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=396.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you know, because we pay dues,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=398.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we're not incurring an additional charge, which we might if we contracted with someone else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=405.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, we've put a pretty aggressive schedule together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=408.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As the mayor indicated, we'll clean it up tonight and get something out to you over the next day or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=413.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the first schedule was obviously the search committee, and the mayor's put something like that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=418.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, just to give you some information with regard to this particular activity,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=426.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Glenn Kuchar indicated to us that he could distribute our brochure, he could distribute our applications, he could take in the applications as they came in, turn them around very quickly, give us a tiering as to who's eligible or not just simply by licensure and a few things like that, get it over to the search committee generally within a day, believe it or not, and create the circumstances in which this would go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=452.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He would also work on creating focus groups<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=454.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and other aspects of this search, site visits, and other things that you may or may not want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=462.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, this will take us into high gear with the idea being that a decision would be made sometime at the beginning of April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=471.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is the path we're on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=475.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The report I'm giving you right now gives you an idea that he'll get it out to a wide audience to help us screen the applicants to make sure the people are eligible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=483.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The search committee will get every applicant, whether they consider them eligible or not, in hard copy as well as electronically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=492.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The survey developed by the school committee, I want to talk to Mr. Rousseau about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=496.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He will assist in getting that out and pulling those results together along with the focus groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=500.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, pulling it together so that it takes the burden off any one member to do that or the administrations to keep it clean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=510.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He'll assist in the preparation of interviews, you know, questions for you to help you develop questions and appropriate information so you can group them properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=518.224s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went through a process of how they do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=520.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, following up with contract negotiations with the successful candidate or the candidate that you select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=526.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=528.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly having an agent on board moves it forward, takes the burden off us to do it, and it keeps us on track to have a decision by April, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=540.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the one thing we've got to understand is that when materials come in, it's confidential at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=547.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just because you get something doesn't mean you go talking about who applied, because people are entitled to a certain amount of privacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=554.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once it reaches the final stage, privacy's off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=558.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then people can see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=560.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be public interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=561.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There'll be all the kinds of things that will give the community total transparency as to the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=566.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very extensive, and I think that, uh, based on the discussions we had today and based on what you will learn in the next few days, that, uh, you'll see this is a very, very wide open search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=576.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intended to bring in candidates around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=578.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, he's in Lexington tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=580.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think Lexington's about to make a decision tonight on its selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=584.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a few other communities that will be moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=587.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we'll be excited to see pools of candidates come into our program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=591.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with that, I think that gives you an update on MASC's involvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=596.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Quickly came to the table with us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=597.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only did it last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=599.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And quickly came to the table today to work out some details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=636.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just if we will, we have to go over a couple of things because it's on your account and we need to move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=641.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of technical things that we're going to have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=698.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the multitude of activities that you'll see will indicate this is going to be a very public process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=728.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there'll be some cost for materials that we have to pass out and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=731.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't we're not talking about search consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=741.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's no that's for full search done by them totally by them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=745.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already put some things together Oh, so it's done quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=748.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's different We'll get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=751.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get a number but the number is not what okay would have been for a full search if they did it from scratch Okay, I just want to be clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=775.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm telling you tonight that Rita DeCarlo, done an outstanding job for us in foreign language, has announced her retirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=784.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an important area for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=785.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She spent over 30 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=787.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm telling you that I want to begin the search at this point in time for her replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=792.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will do it the usual way we do it, where we have some candidates come in, we screen them down, and then we give you a chance through<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=799.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to look at the top three candidates that come to you and you'll give us feedback and then we make an appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=806.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd like to get going with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=815.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=850.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has launched an initiative which will celebrate Massachusetts and Massachusetts' achievements as leading the nation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=861.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts, you know, leads the nation in typical test scores and other kinds of indicators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=867.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, if you look at the PISA results, the international results, if Massachusetts counts itself as a nation, which we do in the rankings, we're always very close to the top, if not on top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=879.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Massachusetts has decided through the department to celebrate that, and they've begun a project to provide a statewide platform for public schools in Massachusetts to celebrate their great achievements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=892.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already begun to pull together highlights and other things that are particular to us that go beyond testing, that highlight the kinds of educational programs that we're running, that we believe make Massachusetts not only tops in those categories of testing, but actually makes Massachusetts, in places like Medford, you know, renowned for doing some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=913.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: programs, whether it's Global Scholars, CCSR, or other things that you have heard about over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=920.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to make you aware of it because we're going to start to ramp up very soon, and we hope that you'll all participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=928.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can see some of the things that are going to go on statewide at the Statehouse and other activities, which will give us an opportunity to highlight our school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=937.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll also use our various media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=939.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To talk about the things that are going well in our community and neighboring communities are the things we collaborate with so that's just an Informational piece for you right now to let you know and welcome any ideas that you may have Thank you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=987.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've actually got some interviews going on, I believe, at the end of this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=993.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be interviewing, they've narrowed it down to three finalists, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of New York, a person who's a deputy commissioner in the state of Texas, and the current superintendent of the Lawrence Public Schools have been designated as the three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1008.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The board will interview them and potentially even next week will make a decision and make their recommendation to the Secretary of Education, Mr. Pizer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1019.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have an affirmation or a veto at his discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1026.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we'll have someone in place very soon in that role when that person will actually take office I don't know probably depends on their current contracts and their current obligations But I assume that in the interim Jeff Wilson will continue to be the acting commissioner until that person can actually assume the role so we expect that to happen fairly soon and I'll get you posted as soon as I know<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1059.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've named three finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1061.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, so if I want to speculate, you know, I might have thoughts, but I mean, it'd be inappropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1104.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as our community becomes culturally and religiously diverse, more so than it has been, although, you know, it's quite a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1114.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1982, 4% of our school population were persons of color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1118.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Today, it's close to 38% in an idea of what's taken place over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1125.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as we become more culturally diverse and religiously diverse, it's incumbent upon us to actively ensure that our students, employees, citizens are treated with respect and dignity and that they celebrate their personal cultures and religious observances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1139.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So adopting appropriate, inclusive holidays, observances, protocols does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1146.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a difference between establishing religion and just allowing people to celebrate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1151.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1153.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rather, it protects it by recognizing the rich diversity of people's experiences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1160.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Massachusetts laws prohibit discrimination in all its forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1163.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The best way to ensure that discrimination does not occur is to educate our students and community through positive learning and experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1171.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We must always seek to move forward, to go beyond toleration to understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1177.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and enlightened understanding for both our diverse and common human heritage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1182.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The topic is far too involved to have a broad discussion this evening, but we need to invest more time through focus groups and additional sessions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1192.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, I've provided you with some materials in preparation for a more robust discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1197.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we certainly will include people, and I've listed holidays and other things that deal with inclusive practices that have been put out by various agencies that are known for their expertise in this area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1210.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, you know, this is not only a local thing, it's a national thing, it's a statewide thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1216.224s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for us to be in the forefront of it is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1219.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good things happening in our community already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1222.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the price of doing the right thing is eternal vigilance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1225.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to be diligent with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1226.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't let it slip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1228.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have a lot of things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1230.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And different things will occur, and there'll be some people that perhaps don't understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1234.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's our job to make sure that everyone feels protected, feels safe, and that we don't have any situation where a person feels isolated because of the policies and practices of our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1265.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what we do is, I'll probably recognize the fact that if a person's out for those holidays and documents it, there's an excuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1300.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So every year we go through various stages of why we close school and why we keep open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1307.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some people understand it and some people agree and some people don't agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1311.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I found the last little while the people who are more aggressively emailing me are generally students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1318.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school students in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1320.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school students, generally around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1323.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 8 o'clock in the morning before a storm, I'm getting things being told that their life is being put in peril and we're endangering them and their families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1332.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I write back to them as courteously as I possibly can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1339.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the most part, people do understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1341.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to take a little bit of opportunity in between storms, if you will, to go over a couple things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1347.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if people are listening, and we'll put it on our website again, they'll get an idea as to how we make these decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1355.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to keep open if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1357.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one supervising them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1361.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many youngsters out there who have no one feeding them if we close the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1366.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, if conditions warranted, having youngsters out in the cold and driving snow, possibly with vehicles sliding on the road,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1376.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Has to be balanced with our decision to open the schools Parents always have the opportunity to make a decision and if they document that they kept the youngster home Because of you know the weather and we have a reason to believe that the weather was that way we will provide an excused absence<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1397.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If, in fact, a youngster comes to us late on a day when conditions are such, rather than delay the whole day, which could mess up a number of things for a number of people, we won't mark them tardy to the extent that there's a reasonable arrival.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1412.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if they come in two minutes before the closing, we might think that that's not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1417.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if they're an hour or so late, that's not a bad problem for us to recognize that as part of travel conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1425.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're entering the winter season, we're in the winter season, and from year to year, we may have more or less closings because of weather, or cold, or any other number of reasons, or for some reason that there's a building problem, or a safety problem that's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1442.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will use our media to inform people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1446.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use all the television media.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1448.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use our own media to put things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1450.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We use robocalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1452.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do everything we possibly can to let people know as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1457.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, this last storm had to wait till almost 6 o'clock in the morning to take a good hard look to see what would come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1463.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I knew in this area we weren't going to get much snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1468.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a little to the west and a little to the north and the southeast, they got snow and they got bad conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1475.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was a tough one because we weren't sure what actually would happen, how it would track.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1481.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one before, people ask me, why didn't you call off school on that Tuesday when it was cold?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1486.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I had called off school on that Tuesday when it was cold, we would have been out Thursday and Friday anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1491.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would have had one day of school that week because Monday was a holiday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1495.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So sometimes you just have to balance it a little bit and think about what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1500.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You also have to think about the fact that teachers and others come from distance, and if they have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1505.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: young people of their own that have to stay home with, they may not come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1509.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or if they have the travel arrangements coming from the north or the south, it may not work for them to be in and on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1515.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may not be a productive day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1518.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are all kinds of considerations if you have to pay attention to where the DPW and the contractors can clear out lots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1525.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: whether we think that the buses can actually make it up and go the various routes, whether the bus stops and the sidewalks have had an opportunity to be cleared to the greatest extent possible, although it's never perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1537.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very rarely perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1539.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of considerations that we have to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1542.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do talk to area colleagues as we come into this kind of season, and we take a look and see what's happening, and we try to make decisions that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1553.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's very important for people to understand that schools provide safety, it provides warmth, it provides nutrition to many youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1560.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we don't take school closings lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1564.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you think that safety is an issue, if you think that we can't clear the lots, we don't think we're going to have a productive day, we will call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1571.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I will try to call it as early as possible, often the night before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1576.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But some days it's not, we don't know until 5 o'clock in the morning, just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1671.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would just tell you that there are people who, not what you're telling me, we should talk about long term, but there are people who rush to do what they call blizzard packs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1680.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I find that unproductive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1681.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We pay our teachers to teach 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1688.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a trade-off to give kids some homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1690.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're supposed to do homework anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1692.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, the reality is that we want our teachers in front of students and they don't want to trade days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1696.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if we get hit like the storm of 1978, we're out a whole week or ten days or something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1703.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could probably have a plan in place to send materials out, especially with today's electronics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1708.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think we should be very careful that we start trading days for short-term days off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1715.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1716.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's long-term, maybe we should consider it through a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1788.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We sent you out on that particular day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1794.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school was not badly attended that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1797.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was over 80% of the people that were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1799.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's pretty good since normal attendance is in the low 90s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1804.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plus teachers, there weren't that many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1805.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were people out, but there weren't that many people out comparatively to what could have been out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1810.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the cold goes, part of the issue was the fact that it came on so suddenly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1814.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certain areas of the building were still trying to adjust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1818.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can work on the heating system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1820.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can work on different aspects of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1822.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of people were in school, and for the 80% plus of the people that were in school, I think it was good to have them there, as opposed to shut it down and then everyone's out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1832.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd end up making it up, and I think it was a day to have, especially that week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1837.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because remember, again, if we called off school that day, we were in school potentially Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1842.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That was a whole week would have been gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1845.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at least we got a couple days in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1846.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1847.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly work on that, and John and I will check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1861.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll certainly have the principals review that as a practice so that they understand that check the room out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1868.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Put them in the warmest place as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2166.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor and members of the school committee, we had an extensive discussion in the committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2171.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, just to briefly summarize it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2177.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The organizations that exist to support our schools are all good people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2181.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2183.178s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They give up a lot of their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2184.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They generate a lot of support for our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2186.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're very grateful and thankful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2189.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, in order to optimize it, in order to make it more efficient and more effective overall across the city, and in order to tie it together with our own work, it's important for us to adopt some guidelines, adopt some training protocols, so that we can help these organizations do that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2207.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and to dovetail much better with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2209.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've put together for you some recommendations to adopt oversight guidelines for PTOs, PTGs, and other 501c3 internal organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2220.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I say internal organizations because I'm not talking about if a major corporation's 501c3 gives us money, I'm not going to ask them to audit their books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2228.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about groups that technically work with us or use our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2236.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michael Bloomberg gives us some money, I'm not going to ask him for his financials this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2241.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess you probably wouldn't send it to me anyway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2243.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I mean, but having said that, you know, our Cummings Foundation, things like that, they give us money and, you know, I'm appreciative that they do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2251.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm talking about the internal groups that are clearly ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2255.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so I've listed eight items and I would ask that you approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2260.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them off or you can accept them as they're written.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2264.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me know what you're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2267.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2269.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Up to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2269.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can read them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2271.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, all PTG, PTOs, and other internal 501c3 organizations affiliated with the Medford Public Schools must be registered with the superintendent's office annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2282.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registrations must be renewed by September 1st of each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2285.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A registration is simply a process of recognizing that an organization exists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2291.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they're out in the street, that there's a number they can have, and if a person who's a member of the community wants to donate, they know this is a valid organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2300.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they, we also know that they exist, and they're using our name, and raising money using our name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2306.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To all registered organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2308.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2322.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MPS one, two, three, four, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2324.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2328.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which is a very simple thing, but I want to know they exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2331.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2332.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see it as it comes down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2334.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it'll come down, you'll see it, okay, you'll see the things that you'll be on the form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2338.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who the officers are, you know, you know, and so and so forth, where they're banking, and the likes of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2349.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All registered organizations must submit bylaws, names of officers and board members, annual fundraising and expenditure plans, and a year-end financial statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2358.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we want to know that every organization has some rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2362.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to know that they have a plan, that it's not just something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2366.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if they want to modify it, they can let us know they want to modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2368.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not running around trying to second guess every move, but they should have a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2374.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And another reason for that is the fact that, you know, if everyone hits the same bank and everyone hits the same business over and over again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2383.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on our community pretty hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2386.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, when the school department goes to them for various things, they might say, well, you already gave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2390.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important for us to know who is being asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for money, who is being repeatedly asked for services, and whether or not it interferes with something that might be a larger project that the school department might be able to do for the greater benefit of all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2425.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2426.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can make changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2429.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a projection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2430.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's like our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2431.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We project certain things and changes happen during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2434.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that nature.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2435.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can just send in a note and say we did something different or we added something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2439.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe it doesn't have to be that tight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2441.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me keep going and then we can hit it all, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2443.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some of these things that sort of intersect with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2446.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, bylaws must clearly identify how a person becomes eligible for membership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2452.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and how a person becomes a voting member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2455.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Distinct difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2456.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, a person comes to a meeting, you know, they may be a member, but if they've been to one meeting in three years, do they have the right to make decisions for a group of people that have been, you know, working on it for an extended period of time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2469.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a decision people can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2474.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must identify what is a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2477.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of them, three people in the room could be a voting quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2480.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is that a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2481.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the executive board to be a voting quorum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2484.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you have to have so many members of the established membership to make a major decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2490.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bylaws must provide detailed information how, when elections for officers and board members will be implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2497.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When is it going to happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2499.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2500.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is the distribution of information so that people know that an election is coming?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2506.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Expenditures or funds must be done in coordination with the principal to ensure that supported programs, activities, and materials are consistent with the school's program and do not distract from the main mission of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2517.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can't have an organization decide to buy a new curriculum that is counter indicative to the ones the school system has adopted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2524.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't have people planning trips that get in the way of testing or planning trips that come just as the testing season's about to begin or planning trips that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2534.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: are not tied to the curriculum in an important way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2539.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe once in a while, but not all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2540.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, we only have 180 days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2543.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure all of them are used properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2549.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The public schools, through the superintendents, will offer training to each entity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2552.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to make sure they all know what forms they have to fill out, if they're raising funds, if they're a non-profit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2559.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want them to understand regulations and ordinances, what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2563.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you pay somebody money, and you pay them a certain amount of money, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2568.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to give them a form, or technically you're paying them under the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2572.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2574.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're giving people money as reimbursement, reimbursement for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2578.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's your, what are you requiring?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2580.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, tonight you asked, you know, about slips and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2583.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's all heavily documented when it comes through the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2587.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are we documenting these things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2589.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give us an idea of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2594.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if a person doesn't participate and doesn't become these things, then we maybe decertify them and say, look, we're not going to register you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2602.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're not going to be an allowable organization because we can't track what you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2606.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then an annual report should be made to the school committee about all the organizations that exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2612.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the general thing, it may not be every expenditure they have, but it certainly should give you an idea of what started the year, what ended the year, and the main activities and the like that they had, and if they had an election, did they change officers, if there were special circumstances, was it reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2628.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think if we do something like that, we'll have helped these organizations be that much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2633.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll help ourselves as we try to coordinate their activities with our initiatives as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2640.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I guess the floor is open for discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2843.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're looking at people who don't have experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2846.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if a person's been doing it and doing it successfully, you don't have to go to things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2852.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have our teachers take courses that they've already passed and know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2856.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's a refresher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2858.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2860.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's new forms, you know, that need to be filed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2864.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes there's changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2865.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That may work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2867.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the governance structure goes in elections,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2871.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's no one running, you just simply certify it through the principal's office that we only have so many people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2877.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you've gotta let people know because, I mean, one of the complaints that we heard, rightly or wrongly, I'm not taking sides on this thing, was that people didn't know how you become an officer, how you participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2888.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And theoretically, under the school council, you're supposed to have that election every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2893.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's required by the statute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2896.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I know it doesn't always happen 100%, but it should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2900.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what I mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2901.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or at least there should be some declaration that the only people that applied for these offices or want to do it are a handful of people, but after a reasonable attempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2911.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we've got to do that, or else people say, well, I'm not involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2916.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't get involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2917.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't consult me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2918.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, what's part of the discussion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2920.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are people consulted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2921.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do they have a chance to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2922.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, one of the issues I think you raised during the campaign was community engagement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2928.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, does the PTO engage the community that it represents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2932.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2934.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there's a balance there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2935.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think we have to make it into a very rigorous process, but I do think there should be some notification that there are officers available, there are board positions available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2946.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Would you like to participate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2949.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3034.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Subcommittee, let's you know, let's let's understand what these subcommittees are supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3038.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Support services deals primarily with services that support the educational program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3042.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is more rules of this is more of the rules of the operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3048.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I'm just, you know, I'm just trying to clarify it for you because I mean, if you want to keep some integrity to your subcommittee assignments, you can do what you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3313.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we get it from the minutes and then we'll move it over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5352.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe we made the adjustments you asked for the amounts of thresholds in the area, so I'd ask that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5579.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we want to make it less bureaucratic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5583.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5584.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's keep it simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5586.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, if there's a situation that requires an additional cost, we'll bring it back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5591.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there's no such cost, let's not make people come back and forth five times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5595.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, the goal of this was to be inclusive and to provide appropriate care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5600.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it turns out that we have a situation, we'll bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5634.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we'll move through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5635.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, there are some people that, you know, resist anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5638.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Look, earlier this evening, you were telling me that I'm making things too bureaucratic for the PTO.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5642.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5642.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm telling you, you're making things too bureaucratic for the teachers and everything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5659.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think obviously the nurse has indicated it's okay until she sees something specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5664.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If something comes up, we'll come bring it back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=1157.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Byddyn nhw'n dod yn ôl yn ein cyfarfodydd nesaf, ymwneud â mynd ym mis Februari, yn hytrach na... Oh, byddai'n dda iawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=1264.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, again, you know, one of the things that we face, and we faced this a couple of times, is that we can't deny a person the right to go, and they may have needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=1275.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, it's important to have the possibility that we would have a nurse on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=1281.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the school system to assume that cost altogether, undercuts our ability to fund, let's say, sponsor these trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=1289.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So by spreading it out, everybody shares a little bit of that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TQ69v4m8ftY&t=6687.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you're talking about the revolving fund?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=225.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam members of the committee, our director of mathematics is here, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=233.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And wants to present this from a gift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=238.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also Barbara Chen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=335.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=387.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=388.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see Haley here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=744.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll be back in our next meeting, looking to go in February, rather than... Oh, it would have been nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=750.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The library's preparing that, so we're keeping Disney busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=812.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nursing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=813.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you point out where we're talking about right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=817.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there was... I'm just trying to make sure I understand the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=859.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the right to go, and they may have needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=862.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, it's important to have the possibility that we would have a nurse on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=867.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the school system to assume that cost altogether undercuts our ability to fund or let's say sponsor these trips.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=876.449s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So by spreading it out, everybody shares a little bit of that responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=929.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The way the civil rights office would look at it is, is that if in fact an individual student, because they had a handicap or some other kind of need, we had to pay more, that would be reducing access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=942.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That would be a, you know, making it more difficult for them to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=946.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's one of the reasons why, you know, it has to be spread out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=949.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the choice is whether the school system picks it up or we spread it out across the cost of the trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=955.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's really the only two choices you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=956.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to have it as a, as a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=959.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, is that who pays?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=961.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it spread out among all the people as a legitimate cost or is it the school system that picks it up every time there's a trip?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1170.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1173.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got some estimates on them that have changed since the last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1176.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll pursue that with people as to find out what, what the status is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1204.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that we ran into a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1459.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1461.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tufts Neighborhood Service Fund provides these, uh, funds to the schools will be used by our early childhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1502.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1505.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The headmaster is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1506.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The director and principal of the vocational school is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1510.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight we'll give you a brief introduction and then we should schedule a more formal meeting to discuss it in greater depth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1517.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But just to go over it so that you have a brief introduction and that you can ask any quick questions you may have of the two individuals, why don't you come on up and we can go over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1528.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, as you know, we're currently in the fourth year of the process of having the two schools collaborate more completely together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1536.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's been a pretty high priority for the school committee because you've made that very clear that you want to see the two schools work closely together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1544.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this goal would continue to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1547.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: expand the program to the comprehensive nature and give opportunities to both students at the Volk and at the high school that were previously not available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1557.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've advanced the program so that there's a lot of participation across the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1562.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This time the ninth and tenth grade students are fully integrated academically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1566.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some eleventh grade students are also integrated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1569.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: High school students can now explore occupational programs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1572.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and so on and so forth, the number of electives.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1574.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there are a number of benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1576.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't read the whole report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1577.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You get the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1579.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you have any direct questions you want to ask to the headmaster or the director, please do so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1584.756s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we can schedule a committee of the whole to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1587.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is important, if we're going to do this, that we move forward, because obviously we need a plan going into next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1701.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we believe that the nature of what we're proposing does not require any contractual, uh, uh, negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1707.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, you know, from time to time, the union may raise something, but, uh, we have, uh, vetted a lot with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=1714.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that, uh, at this point in time, uh, the issues that we have in front of you, changing the LAA code would not fall into that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2332.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, we have the director and the director both here to tell you about some of the fabulous grants we're getting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2825.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, before we move away from these two, I think it's kind of important to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2830.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Here's two examples of the high school and the vocational school working together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2834.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Biotech was never envisioned at the vocational school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2838.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Environmental science was never envisioned as a vocational program because it was really a trade school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2843.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is one of the evolutions that has taken place, and this is one of the results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2848.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is where both sides of the school need to be able to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2852.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because it's equally valuable to whether you're pursuing a high school diploma as a high school or a vocational technical area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2860.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is kind of the kind of thing we're looking at right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2863.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In many of the jobs that come out, a high school graduate who knows this stuff will actually be able to go on and get a two-year degree before they pursue either a four-year degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=2872.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's all kinds of options that are coming out that didn't exist before when we had a more traditional alignment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3035.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, look at the relationships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3036.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The earlier you saw a gift to the robotics club, they go together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3042.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, these things have synergy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3044.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They actually fit together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3045.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's part of the reason why you see them all on the same agenda, so that you can see the relationships of different activities, how they interact with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3053.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not just standalone activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3110.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have our assistant superintendent, buttressed by our director of science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3666.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So madam mayor, if I can, um, as you know, the envision series will be paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3672.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, our next budget will allow some funding that was previously assigned to envision, and then previously before that to journeys will now become available for science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3681.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's our next priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3683.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that was what we discussed at budget last time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3827.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Rocco has brought in kids in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3831.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And like I said a few moments ago, the availability of funding now that Envision has paid for, and Journeys has paid for, now moves to science.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3839.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Rocco will get first crack at those dollars that have been previously assigned to mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3849.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3850.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3863.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, at the elementary level, I mean, the science program has not been everything we want it to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3868.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can see at the upper grades, based on some of the discussions that you've seen, science has taken off in a very, very robust way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3875.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this one of the discussions we had was to make the elementary science program a priority going forward with funding available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3883.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that can be used in the next fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3886.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And with a game plan to review it against the standards, I think you're going to see quite a bit of material going in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3891.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the material that's selected will have to be things that we know will match up with the standards and with either one of the two or three curriculum programs that we would adapt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3902.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, for example, if you're looking at thermodynamics, you're looking at heat and cold and the impact on matter, you can have kits that demonstrate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3912.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that aren't going to be contradictory to any program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3917.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you can do those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3918.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can have botany programs that aren't going to contradict any program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3923.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you won't get the exact program until people actually review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3927.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you will get the opportunity to have additional materials at the elementary level based on our budget allocations next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=3939.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, this is where, you know, if Rocco knows that we are going to allocate, which he will know, we're going to allocate those funds, he will start identifying those items with teachers and letting us know so that we begin the purchasing process going into the summer and possibly running some workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4017.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The final program selection won't be until 2018-19, but the curriculum based on standards and based on new materials will be available next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4422.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, every teacher has their own evaluation and they set up SMART goals and they set up individual goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4428.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, obviously you try to encourage them to take on goals that are going to advance their capacity to help their students in their classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4436.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, there are so many different areas for an elementary school teacher to be involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4442.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of which is, many of which these things are tied to differentiated instruction, working with youngsters who have other needs and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4452.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The content areas, you know, really vary based on the expertise of the teachers as to which ones they would spend more time with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4460.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly something as important as this, you know, will get greater emphasis in our discussions with the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4470.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many things that teachers need to be competent in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4509.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, there are at least, in most instances, four sections in each elementary school by grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4516.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes it's five.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4519.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And generally within each of those groups, there are people who have expertise in different areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4523.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's important that we emphasize that they share with each other and that they work together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4528.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've done that right along, but we need to perhaps emphasize that a little bit to people that are more akin to a particular subject matter like science, that they step up and serve maybe as a little bit of a leadership role for the other members of that group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4609.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you know, we have to test our non-native language speakers, our ELL students, every year under a system called the WIDA testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4619.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our director of ELL is here to go over that with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4624.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4625.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4626.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we want to bring you up to date in case you hear these terms and you want to know what's going on with regard to access testing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4633.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and how it works in terms of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4636.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Leslie Trotter is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4881.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you heard about ELL or EL, you know, in the use of technology and the use of technology and with regard to our other programs, science programs and the like, one of the most important initiatives that we have to launch in this district is to upgrade our technology network infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4902.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, in order to be eligible for substantial,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4904.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: tier two E-rate funding and related grants, we have to complete a study of our current network infrastructure, which will then guide our applications for funding and ensure that we efficiently and effectively identify and target the critical elements of our infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4922.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're eligible approximately for $400,000 federal entitlement funds, which we then have to match with an additional 40% at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4932.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This funding would then supplement local capital funds and other available grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4937.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The funding is available this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4940.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We cannot guarantee that going forward, given changes in Washington and other places, that the money will be available in subsequent years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4948.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it behooves us to go get it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4952.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's imperative that we act now for multiple reasons, the availability of funding,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4956.421s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the overall demand for technology for both instructional and administrative matters, the increased requirement to implement computer-based estate testing, and planned initiatives for online coursework and remedial credit recovery programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4971.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Further, the purchase of state-of-the-art hardware and software must be supported by a network infrastructure that is sufficiently constructed to enable simultaneous high utilization and to filter out cyber malware<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4984.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: consistent with SIPA standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4985.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: SIPA is the Computer Protection Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=4992.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The study must provide us with detailed information, an independent assessment that is free from internal bias, which we tend to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5000.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody has a different idea of what ought to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5003.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Programs and services are becoming increasingly dependent upon a robust and reliable internet and intranet capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5011.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we selected,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5013.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: TechEdge of Cambridge to conduct the study and provide us with ongoing support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5018.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: TechEdge is our current E-rate consultant and have done this for a period of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5023.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They are also the E-rate consultants in the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Massachusetts Instructional Technology, Informational Technology rather, Massachusetts Department of Youth Services, and over 20 Massachusetts school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5038.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they serve as the technical consultants to the DESE Office of Digital Learning<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5043.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the digital connections partnership grant, which is another grant we'll go after, which is an important grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5048.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're the consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5050.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anyway, you know, what's in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5053.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you agree with me, we need to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5055.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to get this done so we can apply and move it, move it forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5076.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be approving check-edge, approximately that kind of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5078.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't think it'll exceed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5080.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it may be less than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5082.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it'll be paid for by funds that we acquire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5088.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: E-rate funds that we acquire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5092.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Out of the funds we currently acquire from E-rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5096.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get about $60,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5103.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I planned for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5108.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, their contract, they have a state contract to provide this service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5113.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can avoid that and work with people that have knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5117.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right, this is a company that we work with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5153.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5154.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll begin that process as we go forward from this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5158.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we can then acquire the company and then we'll put together a package for presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5178.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have to believe that the Medford City Council will be supportive of enhancing technology in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5186.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe that they would be less than supportive of something<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5189.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that would provide us with close to $400,000 position us to get additional dollars and allow our students to have the latest information capacity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5214.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll leave that to you, but I think the reality is that we need to put together our plan, we need to come in and say what we're going to do, and then we should be asking for more than...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5225.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just a match for this from the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5275.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to continuously do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5309.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the project will work with the consultants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5312.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, they'll report directly to myself and to Christine, the business office, but we'll work closely with Alan Arena, who is our network<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5320.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and Richie Trotter, who is our instructional media supervisor, and all the other people, Molly Gladen, who works on our special projects, and all the support staff in the technology area, as well as the department heads and the like who know what they need for their particular areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5335.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they'll be interviewed, and all their input will come together in a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5340.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this report will reflect not only what, you know, the actual inside network does, but also what people believe they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5431.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to appoint Alicia Palmer, who works in our human resources area with the Director of Finance and Administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5440.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to take on that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5441.832s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Alicia is very computer savvy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5443.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's extremely diligent and capable of doing this kind of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5447.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's where we're going to go with this appointment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5451.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we believe that there's a lot involved here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5456.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've already started to get some requests across our table, and they need to be responded to very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5462.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to have the capacity to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5466.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Naturally, no one person does things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5467.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual coordinates other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5469.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if something's requested from a department, that individual needs to get on that department to get the information, pull it up, coordinate it, pull it together, and ship it out in a timely way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5499.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't affect our budget that much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5500.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we're talking about approximately $5,000 of annual outlay, uh, to do this plus any costs associated with the production of materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5509.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can charge individuals making the request and we will recoup a substantial portion of that cost, um, over time because as individuals request items, we will appropriately charge them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5523.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If individual requests, a simple couple of documents, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5526.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if an individual requests any kind of work, we're going to be charging them at the rate that's allowed by law, and also for the paperwork and production that's required by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5543.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's appointable because the individual is not part of a unit, and they don't have to be bid within a unit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5549.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's why we're keeping it close to our office so that Kirsten and I can monitor it very closely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5556.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously, an individual getting a request would have to know what can be asked, what can't be asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5561.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will also provide training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5563.247s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're also going to run some training programs so that everybody is really on top of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5569.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is one of those things where there are fines if we don't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5572.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to, we need to have everything properly set up and we need to have an inventory and an archive for everything we responded to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5611.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee, we did get some inquiries from people about why we didn't always let students out, you know, on recess and cold days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5620.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, I've tried to provide something that would give us some guidance and I just try to go through it a little bit because I think some people,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5628.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: think that there's one universal thing you can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5632.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't paint this with a broad brush.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5634.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Days are different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5636.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not only temperature, it's wind chill, it's ground conditions, it's disabilities on the part of certain youngsters in certain situations that take place, it's timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5648.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's so many different factors that come into play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5651.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But recently, some elementary parents have raised the concern that students were not allowed to have outdoor recess on certain cold weather days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5659.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we all recognize that recess, and we've talked about this many times, is an important element of the school day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5663.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It provides an opportunity for students to get a break from academics, to burn off excess energy, and get some exercise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5671.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Current time and learning regulations, as well as curriculum demands of the school, limit the amount of time we can currently allow for recess at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5680.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Outdoor recess is certainly desirable in most instances because it changes the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5686.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It provides fresh air opportunities to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5688.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, there are significant reasons to keep students indoors when weather conditions are adverse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5694.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is no national standard for keeping students indoors or allowing them to go outdoors for school recess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5701.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As a result, site principals must make the decision based upon local conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5706.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We trust our principals to make decisions about the safety of our youngsters in many ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5712.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to trust them to make this decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5715.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We give them some guidance, but they need to be able to have that discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5719.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want to be making it from distance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5722.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Temperatures alone is not sufficient to control decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5726.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Wind chill, rain, ice, snow, other factors have to be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5730.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not all students, and that's true of a lot of students who come to our schools, have sufficient layered clothing to withstand extreme cold and other weather factors, even if we try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5741.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Student safety is most important consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5744.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Decisions aren't made with a broad brush.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5746.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can encourage outdoor recess,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5748.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but ultimate decisions must rest with the building principal at the local school site.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5753.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now there are a number of things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5756.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can advise parents to provide layered clothing, including hats and gloves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5761.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can also carry a supply of our own for some youngsters who don't have it, who don't come prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5767.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that sometimes is reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5770.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can reschedule recess to some degree for a warmer part of the day if possible, maybe a little bit later in the morning rather than earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5777.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Difficult because there's a lot of other factors going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5780.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can shorten the time spent outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5784.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mix indoor with outdoor time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5785.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe it's 10 minutes outside, read in the full time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5789.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can differentiate which students participate either by age or by condition when circumstances allow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5796.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously we have to closely monitor certain students who may be more susceptible to cold conditions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5802.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will direct principals to keep a log of the days when outdoor recess is not implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5808.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll collect the data and review it this spring to see what patterns emerge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5813.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, it's my strong recommendation that principal discretion be maintained.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5818.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We trust our principals to make safety decisions regarding students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5822.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is just one of the many safety decisions that they must make on a daily basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5828.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I provided a chart for you to look at, which we'll provide to them, and they've been provided with some of this material in the past, to look at this stuff to see exactly how to make these decisions maybe a little bit more scientifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5850.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will once, you know, we're through tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5852.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5852.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, I wanted to present it to you and get feedback that you have, but we'll send this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5866.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, every building has its own culture, but I will now make it imperative upon the teacher to consult with the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5915.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, sometimes an older child can go out, a younger child may not be able to go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5919.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, there may be some mitigating circumstances, but the emphasis will be on having the school work as a unit as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5928.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the principal consult with those teachers who might have a particular reason for not wanting to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5933.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to maintain principal discretion, but I also want to encourage them to not prevent outdoor recess just on a cavalier basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5942.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I do want them to have some discretion because there are individual situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5946.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a class in which some of the youngsters have severe colds or have some colds or just come back from colds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5951.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some youngsters with other considerations on ground cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5955.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ice on the playground or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5957.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All these things need to be thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5959.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we trust our principals to make decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5962.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to give them discretion, but we'll monitor it, log it, and then review to see what the pattern has been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5975.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, and monitor the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5978.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I wouldn't want teachers just simply to say, I'm not going out because I don't want to go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5982.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really got to be a situation where there's a reason<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5985.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=5985.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not doing it generally based on environmental conditions, but there may be a few other human conditions that require a consideration on a given day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6021.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think, you know, people have different opinions and I understand that some people are hardier than other people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6026.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people ski on a regular base and other people have never been on a mountain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6029.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I mean, but, uh, but the reality is, is that, you know, we need to have some sort of balance in a school and we need to respect the right of the principal, uh, to, uh, make a judgment and then we'll monitor it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6041.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll monitor it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6067.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think we've got to use our common sense, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6081.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, I'll call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Kirstine, who's been working real hard and doing a great job to deliver the financial report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6107.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6225.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6225.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Say that again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6226.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6265.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll, uh, we have a discussion of cafeteria employees contracts coming up in executive session and we can bring, we'll bring a report in, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kKaLG9Onz28&t=6274.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, subsequent time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=907.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, it's our distinct privilege and honor this evening to have with us Medford resident Professor Emeritus at Suffolk University, Edward Clark, who is the husband of the late Director of our English Department, Leah R. Kaleri-Clark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=923.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: did an outstanding job during her time as the leader of that department and as an inspiration to our faculty and to our teachers and to our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=935.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Professor Clark is here this evening with his attorney, Paul Kelly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=941.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they are going to make a presentation and ask the committee to accept a gift in honor and memory of Leah in the amount of $25,000 to serve as a scholarship.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=953.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like at this time to call upon Attorney Kelly and Professor Clark to join us at the rostrum here to make any statements they would like to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=964.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While they're coming up, I'd indicate that under the direction of our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, we have set up some criteria.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=973.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have it in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=974.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't read it at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=975.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But she is also here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=977.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we welcome any questions that you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1396.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to also comment that I had the pleasure of working with Leah for many years and, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1408.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He was a very, very outstanding educator and a good kind person who really cared about our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1413.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I also want to make note that attorney Kelly this evening is with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1418.564s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He is the husband of the superintendent of the Arlington public schools and the former chairperson of the Winchester public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1424.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a pleasure to have you here and give our best to Kathy because she's a terrific educator too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1429.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1449.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, I call upon our assistant superintendent to join us and explain this gift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1567.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, a return performance by our assistant superintendent, because it's Columbus School Night and we're going to discover a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=1574.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so she'll present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2362.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was an outstanding activity, and I'm going to call upon our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, to brief you on the exciting day that our young people had at the Science Museum, along with Dr. Piazza.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2849.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, it's interesting and perhaps ironic that tonight Jean became the first principal of the New Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2857.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And tonight we celebrated<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2858.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: achievements of the Columbus School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2860.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that something comes together mystically in our world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2865.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As Jean opened that school and she was the queen of her castle as she would announce in the morning, every morning over the loudspeaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2873.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2898.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, the CASET program, the Centro Attivo Scholastico program, which presents- Italian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2912.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: funds for us to keep our elementary language program going and to also support the development of the Italian culture within our schools, so central to the fact that there's such a strong Italian heritage in our community as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2928.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I had the opportunity to attend a meeting yesterday, and several of our elementary teachers were recognized, and Anne Marie was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2937.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the ever energetic Jaconda Mata, who heads the organization, presented us with a check for $50,000 to help support that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=2947.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend that we accept it and make it work for us as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=107.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're thrilled to have with us a number of people who have come out to help us promote this program, representing Channel 4, Lisa Hughes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=118.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from Nesson, Courtney Cox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=120.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have with us the headmaster of the high school, Dr. John Perella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=129.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Director of the Vocational Technical High School and Principal of the Vocational Technical High School, Dr. Heidi Riccio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=134.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Director of Finance and Operations, who's done a great job keeping track of all the finances moving on this project, Kirsteen Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=147.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our Deputy Superintendent of Schools, Beverly Nelson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=154.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I should probably introduce everybody in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=156.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The architect is Scott Payette.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=160.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Somebody from Integrated, I haven't seen anyone from Integrated yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=165.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=166.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=171.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ah, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=172.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My favorite disc jockey, Hank Morse from WRR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=174.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hank, this whole program is going to make great music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=183.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, well, look, this is a great opportunity that has been developed by a lot of wonderful people working for the schools and working for the community under the mayor's direction, who's made a terrific commitment to making sure that Medford not only has a fine vocational program, but also has an outstanding community access program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=201.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank the mayor for her efforts in making sure this happens as we work through all the different changes and things that have to happen to ensure that we have the right studio, the studio that's going to last us for a number of years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=213.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in a studio that's going to help our young people grow and develop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=216.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to thank the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=221.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anyway, today I think it's really important for all of us to recognize the importance of communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=228.281s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we live in a world where a lot of things get put out there, some of them not so true, some of them partly true, some of them who knows if they're true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=238.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is, is that, you know, our young people need to be able to understand communication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=242.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They need to understand what is real, what isn't real, how it should be presented, and ways to attract people so they can be informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=250.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The community needs a voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=252.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We live in an age where we need a community conversation under the mayor's leadership and the leadership of many members of her staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=259.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to begin a whole project of community conversations that help the community talk about the issues that sometimes plague other communities and could plague our community in ways that would be destructive and divisive and not constructive in a way that would help us grow and move forward as a 21st century school system and community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=276.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's very important that this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=278.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: project to actually happen and actually happen in a way that is going to promote the best of what is Medford and the best of what is our area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=286.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's our hope that as the construction goes forward during the spring that we will also produce community programming and school and government programming as we work from temporary stations like this room and other places with the help of our key people like Chrissy Frazier, who's Miss Chrissy over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=301.532s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chrissy is okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=302.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our two teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=303.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great for media technology, Richie Trotta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=312.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Alison Goldsberry, all the people that have worked in the department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=315.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the Department of Information Officer, Lisa Evangelista.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=319.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got so many good people working and helping us at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=323.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Procurement Office, Shahb Khan and her people, real helpful with something and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=328.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got Lisa Nunley, our new Director of Finance and Administration for the city, who's going to make sure the school department has all the money they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=343.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all the people from the office who are helpful to us, and all the people on our advisory committees who have stepped up and provided good guidance and information on the best way to do things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=353.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're thrilled to have this opportunity to be part of this groundbreaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=357.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So without further ado, it's my great pleasure to introduce you to the Mayor of the City of Medford, the Honorable Stephanie M. Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=496.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now my great pleasure to introduce you with the driving force behind a lot of things that happen in our vocational school and in our community right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=504.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The energetic, very<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=509.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: productive and very, very successful director and principal of a vocational school, Dr. Heidi Riccio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=521.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have to say... That's your evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=524.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, there you go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=831.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=831.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you ladies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=832.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously we're really excited about our young people and what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=835.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just have to look around the school to see all the terrific things they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=839.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It makes you very proud and makes you feel very good about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=842.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our teachers and about our students and their parents and how they commit themselves to their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=847.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this time, I'd like to invite some of our media guests up to, if they'd like to say a few words, Lisa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=852.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Lisa Hughes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=934.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=936.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you all know, Lisa was the MC at the Crystal Campbell Dedications and did a terrific job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=941.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate the way she<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=943.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: brought that program forward on behalf of the entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=950.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They won't send you a tax bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=954.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let's call Courtney Cox if she'd like to come up from Nessun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1034.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now meant for its favorite radio voice, Hank Morse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1158.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before we move to the site for the ribbon cutting and a tour of the upcoming facility, I also want to have a little shout out to our reporter from the Medford Transcript, Alex, who has just been recruited by Theo Epstein to be the public relations director of the Chicago Cubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1180.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, something like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1182.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's in Chicago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1185.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He'll be leaving us at the end of the week, and I'll have to work over another report and see if we can get some good stories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1198.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we should make our way to the area where we're going to have the ribbon cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1202.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1203.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, we're going to do a picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1206.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Don't move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1207.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just watch your step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1209.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Watch your step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1209.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to go in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bGVXlnyMrYY&t=1211.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Watch your step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=218.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I spoke to the music department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=221.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are currently 76 wind instruments that have been rented at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=226.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of them at the elementary level, there are about 66, another 10 at the middle school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=232.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the instruments beyond the middle school are either owned by the individuals or, well, they are owned by the individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=237.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By that time, they've paid for them if they've worked them up all the way up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=241.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we currently have about 76 instruments that are rented in the school system, mostly at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=288.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, if I can, the third word is issuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=292.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not borrow, loan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=294.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=295.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Issued from the school department, whether it's issued on a lease purchase or issued as a pure rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=320.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're contracted by the school department to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=323.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=324.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, the school department is issuing it through the private company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=328.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on behalf of the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=334.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I think I'm correct, I spoke to Mr. Casey, who unfortunately can't be here because he's not feeling well at this point, but he told me that for Medford students, they are issuing it at about $100 for a wind instrument.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=347.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the year, which is well below market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=350.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they issue to another school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=353.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think he says he rents to about 127 different school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=357.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's $25 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=358.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Medford, it's $100 for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=361.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a very sharp discount for a Medford student, Jack, as a graduate of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=366.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we obviously feel some obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=374.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last cost I saw for a typical wind instrument, trumpet, a clarinet, something of that type, and please correct me if I'm wrong, was approximately $125 for the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=384.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say that that's the neighborhood, but it is not necessarily the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=391.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A larger instrument, for example, a typical kid wouldn't buy a tuba.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=394.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, that's something we would do and then we would have to be responsible for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=570.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, but that's what he told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=571.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him what the cost would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=573.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he said, that's what it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=578.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't say he could sterilize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=579.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him what he thought the cost was since he did, you know, I thought he would know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=584.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=586.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's way off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=595.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't remember that, but if it's, if it's less, it's less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=599.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's much less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1433.884s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, let's clarify a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1436.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The statute says that when the school department issues something for a student to use or borrow, to use or borrow, not own, to use or borrow, then we have to notify parents of this option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1452.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it's incumbent upon us to give them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1457.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pros, maybe some cons if there are, as to why they would or wouldn't do this, the pricing, and to tell them how it works and how to access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1467.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as the school department doing it, if we set up a system where people can bring their instruments to us so we can give them to the appropriate company, that's easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1479.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1480.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't have a problem doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1482.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue is really more of setting up a system, providing appropriate flyer, which I'll provide to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1489.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have one issue, and maybe an attorney can enlighten us on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1493.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is to whether or not there's more than one company, because obviously we have bid laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1497.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is there one more than one company at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1500.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words, saying if we put something out, this might be a sole source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1503.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it's a sole source, we put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1505.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if another source were to show up, we would have to, over time, explain that to people that they have that option as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1512.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, it's not a difficult thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1516.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that we want to provide appropriate notification<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1519.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with providing appropriate notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1522.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people can make up their own mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1524.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they believe that this is in their best interest, then fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1527.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they don't believe it's in their best interest, then that's a choice they can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1532.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's what we're involved with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1534.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The statute is not a difficult one to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1536.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a question of how we have people access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2336.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, and Reverend, I think it's really important, given the climate that sometimes pervades our world, that we reemphasize not only to ourselves as adults, but to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2350.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the students that this is important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2353.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when the adults make a motion of this type, you're sending a message to the young people who perhaps have not thought it through as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2361.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important for us to be able to say this is something that the adults have taken an active stand on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2366.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's another reason for doing it in a public body and especially in a school system where we have the care and responsibility of educating our young people about how to get along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2378.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've talked a lot about social and emotional health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2381.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked a lot about some of the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2383.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have to tell you, the academic issues will take care of themselves over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2387.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ones that won't are the social and emotional and the personal interactions of young people if we don't step up as role models and if we don't step up as voices to help them find voice as they grow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2402.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So to help them with their transition to adulthood, it's critical that we take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2407.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: visible stance on human issues, human rights, and human fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2423.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2793.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, Rocco Sierra is unable to be with us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2798.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's not feeling well, but we have a terrific substitute, our deputy superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3237.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I guess so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3237.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She wants to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3239.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, just one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3241.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just want to remind you that on the 14th, you've all been invited to the science museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3247.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you haven't got the thing on the, uh, the global scholars program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3251.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to intersect with the Bloomberg gift to the Science Museum on science innovation and innovation around the world, how our middle school students are talking to students from around the world on scientific issues like the digital environment, water, and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3268.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're invited to participate and to watch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3272.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's on the 14th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3273.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll reemphasize that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3275.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's another aspect of how science gets integrated into a lot of other activities as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=3330.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, making a second appearance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4391.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, a couple of weeks ago we gave you a draft of a reasonable use policy with regard to technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4400.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, we pulled it off the table because there was some information that came to us from the ACLU and some other people that we wanted to, uh, review to ensure that we didn't miss anything and that we had a properly looked at legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4413.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4414.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can control how devices are used in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4418.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't control what people do on their own privately as long as it doesn't affect or harass other students or result in bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4426.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly the curriculum can talk about these things and the communication and the hostility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4433.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also the community conversations issue really speaks to this, about people saying things, whether it's about sex or it's about hate or other forms of inappropriate conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4444.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will all come to play through the curriculum, but I think at the same token, a reasonable use policy when we reemerge it, possibly as early as next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4454.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to make sure that it's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4456.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've vetted it with enough legal, and maybe the first of the year if we want to take a little bit more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4462.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll speak to the issue of use of devices in schools and suggestions as to what young people should not be doing with their devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4487.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there shouldn't be any use of that device for that purpose during the school day in the school setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4492.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it does happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4493.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that in of itself would be a violation of the reasonable use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4497.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that should be forbidden for use during the day of anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4502.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if it happens outside, you know, it's kind of hard to police that unless it results in some form of bullying or inappropriate harassment that might exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4512.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, but you have to be real about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4514.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we don't control what people do on the street outside of us except if we are told that it affects how one student interacts with another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4523.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the education side, we can bring that up through the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4529.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it were happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4530.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it were happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4531.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4532.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it were happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4657.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can, you know, introduce the term sexting, you know, because that would be a common application of communication issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4663.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's a problem of doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4665.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think the education side is one side and the technical side is the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4669.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, it comes together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4671.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not like we're ignoring one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4827.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Rachel, I think the assumption here is that there was nothing going on at the middle school in health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4831.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think maybe you should talk a little bit what we are doing in the middle school because I think there's somehow that you see an elementary piece and a high school piece, but we haven't talked about the middle school piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4863.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of the things that we've got to understand is a common thread that runs through everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4868.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How do young people make good decisions about anything, whether it's alcohol, sex, behavior towards others, race, things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4880.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The whole constant of all these curricula deals with the issue of good decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4885.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How you are responsible to yourself and others as you move through, regardless of the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4891.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that's really the common thread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4893.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe we just simply have to weave in some additional content is really what you're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4900.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that we can give people at least an introduction to that since it seems to be a concern that may be emergent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5027.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Deputy superintendent will comment on that if you need additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5034.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we announce the date because I think it's important that parents know so they can plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5065.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me tell you why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5067.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I picked a Monday because I want the continuity of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5073.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to have it on the Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5074.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You come to school for two days and then you have day off and then you go another two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5078.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it breaks up the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5080.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incumbent upon the faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5081.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incumbent upon students not to use this as an excuse to extend the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5086.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to make that clear to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5088.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's important that we not lose four days consecutively, and just simply have two days, break it up in the middle of the week, and then it really doesn't help us in terms of keeping momentum going in classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5113.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, there's a lot going on in the evaluation process at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5119.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's going back and forth between the Teachers Association, the MASC, the MASS, the Commissioner's Office and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5126.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we want to keep you informed because it's a hot topic right now and I want you to understand, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5132.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5133.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, there was a proposed change that the commissioner brought to the attention of the destiny board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5139.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, this past week, uh, commissioner Chester introduced a change that because of the feedback he was getting from the field, no one was really happy with the way there was, it was set up previously that would there be a student impact rating that was independent of the, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5157.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with a regular rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5159.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we came up with an approach that would embed it in standard two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5163.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so it would be part of the standard two rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5167.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The teacher's association, as you can see from what's been attached, is adamantly opposed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5173.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MASS and the MASC believe it's workable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5177.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the board has sent it out for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5180.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the next couple of months, there'll be public comment, and we'll see what actually takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5185.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's an important element of public policy, because obviously, there's got to be some form of teacher evaluation going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5192.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the question is, is that is student learning a legitimate element of determining how effective a teacher is in the classroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5199.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it shouldn't be so plastic that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5203.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The teacher who works with the most challenged of students is expected to have the same results as the teachers working with the gifted and talented student who self-motivates and teaches themselves in some ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5215.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Albeit, good teachers inspire anybody at any level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5219.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, the debate is very sharp right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5223.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it reflects a great deal of back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5227.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm not sure exactly how it's going to end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5231.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will tell you that it is tying us up in terms of dealing with the Teachers Association, in terms of coming up with new ideas as to how to properly evaluate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5241.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It does create a back and forth between the associations in the Commonwealth, and it clearly is a topic that we're going to hear more and more about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5253.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to keep you informed, I want you to know what people are saying, what happened at the board, what happened with the memo you have from the Teachers Association, both from the MTA and the AFT, although it's on the MTA stationery, as to what their objections are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5268.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll continue to talk about this because the way we evaluate teachers, the way we set goals for performance is very important to us, and how we measure that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5279.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is also very important and it will affect personnel decisions going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5284.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, happy to take any questions you may have, but I think the rest of it is self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5303.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5308.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Patterson is doing a great job and stepping in so quickly and Good evening madam mayor members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5374.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5454.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, one of the things, I'll just say this as a commentary on what's going on, we don't know what the federal policy is going to be going into next year with regard to USDA reimbursements to the state and to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5470.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The supply of commodities and things of that type, it could change at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5475.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's some uncertainty on that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5478.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to deal also with the fact that, you know, the price of food in local markets, we have, you know, some issues with regard to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5486.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go up farm to school and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5488.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want farm fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5489.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want certain kinds of food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5491.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to be careful about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5492.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But so far the food service program is doing fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5495.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, we'll monitor that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5496.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our goal would be not to raise prices unless we absolutely have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5500.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to give you as much advance notice as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5502.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I appreciate what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5542.459s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5542.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5543.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I will point out to you that more and more of our students are becoming eligible for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5549.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's two schools that received equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5552.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had to have at least 50% of the student body eligible in order to even apply for the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5558.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the others aren't too far behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5559.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's only one school that's really kind of, you know, doesn't have that economic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5564.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But most of the others are starting to head towards that 50% threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5568.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's simply the nature of the demographic in the community, so we are conscious of that very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5576.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To the extent that they want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5577.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some kids will never tell you because they don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5580.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some families won't, but more and more we're paying attention to that because obviously it affects us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5586.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of the reason that prices had to be raised, just so we can remind ourselves of this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5590.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: was the fact that the USDA insisted that we charge at least as much as they were reimbursing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5596.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They weren't going to reimburse us more money than we were charging ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5600.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was an important thing to bring it up, so we had to actually bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5604.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the point's well taken, and we'll follow up, and we'll try to do the best we can in giving a word out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5758.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in our last meeting, you asked me to draft a letter from you to our legislative delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5763.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have done so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5764.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you, you know, had a chance to hopefully to look it over so that we can send it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5768.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to bring you up to date on a couple more things that have since emerged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5772.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, but that law I did attach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5774.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an advisory from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, legal counsel, which went into a great deal of depth about some of the legal challenges in implementing this law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5786.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also had the opportunity today to meet with the state treasurer as part of the Economic Empowerment Task Force, which I serve, about the implementation, because the implementation comes under her jurisdiction, at least at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5800.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you may know, there's no money<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5802.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that's been allocated in the current budget for it and the current collections have gone down this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5806.536s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's hard to know where that new money is coming and there's no consensus to borrow from the rainy day fund from either the governor or the speaker of the house or the state treasurer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5816.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's unlikely that this will be off and running very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5820.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, because they, they need money to set up the apparatus to do the, the kinds of things that are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5827.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Still, we should be on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5828.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition, we should also note that there are some interesting federal laws that are going to intersect with this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5836.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is the Drug-Free Schools Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5839.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the Communities Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5841.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's also, you know, a discussion of states' rights versus federal supremacy clause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5848.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the federal supremacy clause,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5850.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: federal laws take precedent over state laws, unless they're covered by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, which reserves rights to the state that are not enumerated for the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5862.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But depending on the court, it really depends on what the judges want to rule at any one time, because it's gone both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5869.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's entirely possible that the incoming Attorney General, who has been very strong in his advocacy against marijuana, recreational or medical, in his home state,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5880.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and in the Senate may actually take a more aggressive stance than the current Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5888.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot going on as to how this stuff is going to play out in the national and the local scene in the upcoming months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5896.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing, too, that maybe people don't fully realize is that because it's a federal crime, money's collected for this revenue from marijuana<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5907.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can't be deposited in a federal bank because it's a criminal act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5916.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, all kinds of, but you know, there's going to be, it's going to be very interesting to see how they play with that because with a new, if you will, sheriff in town at the White House, it could very well be a very difficult thing that goes forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5929.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the interim, it doesn't hurt for us to be on record with the letter that I've drafted for you or any amendments you want to make to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5937.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, but I think that it's going to be a little while before we start to see this, uh, take place and where it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5976.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The superintendent would like to mention just a couple of quick, quick things, you know, again, tomorrow at 1230 is groundbreaking at the community access channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5986.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be hosted in part by the mayor, by Lisa Hughes from channel four of Courtney Cox from Nesson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5993.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and a number of other people from the media coming to see us in action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5998.351s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it'll be a good opportunity to see how this thing is progressing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6001.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good work is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6003.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christina has been working real hard with city officials to ensure that the construction goes forward and that the necessary modifications are made so that things go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6013.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But tomorrow's an opportunity to see things from the actual site and to get some reports at that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6021.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you two articles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6022.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: from Time Magazine, which was referenced by Paulette a short time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6028.224s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're worth reading because I think what's important is that we stay up on what's being said out there so we can have the dialogues necessary to guide the future directions of our resources and our curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6041.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should be noted that the President-Elect has named an incoming U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6045.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of Education, Elizabeth Betsy DeVos of Michigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6049.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's an active supporter of school choice, charters, and vouchers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6053.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She also has announced that she's against the Common Core.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6057.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see where that happens, what that means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6059.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, back to the Supremacy Clause versus states' rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6063.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All those kinds of things have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6066.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's going to be very interesting to see, especially coming off the most recent initiative petition in the Commonwealth as to what kinds of incentives will be made to the communities, the states, to expand choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6081.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6082.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts Constitution forbids certain types of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6086.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, you know, it's hard to know how it will all intersect, but it bears watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6091.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are just a few items to bring to your attention, and hopefully you can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=6096.58s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, on the 14th, if you intend to go, let us know so we can arrange for parking and the other things for you at the Science Museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=218.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I spoke to the music department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=221.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are currently 76 wind instruments that have been rented at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=226.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of them at the elementary level, there are about 66, another 10 at the middle school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=232.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most of the instruments beyond the middle school are either owned by the individuals, well, they are owned by the individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=237.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By that time, they paid for them if they worked them up all the way up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=241.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we currently have about 76 instruments that are rented in the school system, mostly at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=288.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, if I can, the third word is issuance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=292.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not borrow or loan, it's issued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=295.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Issued from the school department, whether it's issued on a lease purchase or issued as a pure rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=320.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're contracted by the school department to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=323.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=324.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, the school department is issuing it through the private company on behalf of the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=334.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I think I'm correct, I spoke to Mr. Casey, who unfortunately can't be here because he's not feeling well at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=340.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But he told me that for Medford students, they are issuing it at about $100 for a wind instrument for the year, which is well below market.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=350.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they issue to another school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=353.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think he says he rents to about 127 different school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=357.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's $25 a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=358.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In Medford, it's $100 for the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=361.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a very sharp discount for a Medford student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=364.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Jack is a graduate of the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=366.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we obviously feel some obligation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=374.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The last cost I saw for a typical wind instrument, trumpet, a clarinet, something of that type, and please correct me if I'm wrong, was approximately $125 for the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=386.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say that that's the neighborhood, but it is not necessarily the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=390.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=390.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A larger instrument, for example, a typical kid wouldn't buy a tuba.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=394.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, that's something we would do and then we would have to be responsible for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=420.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: until they paid it off, typically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=570.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, but that's what he told me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=571.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him what the cost would be and he said, that's what it would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=578.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't say he could sterilize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=579.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I asked him what he thought the cost was since he didn't, you know, I thought he would know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=584.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I'm wrong, you know, he's way off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=595.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't remember that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=595.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=598.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if it's, if it's less, it's less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=599.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1433.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, let's clarify a few things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1436.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The statute says that when the school department issues something for a student to use or borrow, to use or borrow, not own, to use or borrow, then we have to notify parents of this option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1452.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it's incumbent upon us to give them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1457.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the pros, maybe some cons if there are, as to why they would or wouldn't do this, the pricing, and to tell them how it works and how to access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1466.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, as far as the school department doing it, if we set up a system where people can bring their instruments to us so we can give them to the appropriate company, that's easily done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1478.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not difficult to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1480.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't have a problem doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1482.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue is really more of setting up a system, providing appropriate flyer, which I'll provide to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1489.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have one issue, and maybe an attorney can enlighten us on this one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1493.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is to whether or not there's more than one company because obviously we have bid laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1497.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is there one more than one company at this time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1499.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1500.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in other words, saying if we put something out, this might be a sole source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1503.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it's a sole source, we put that out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1505.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if another source were to show up, we would have to, over time, explain that to people that they have that option as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1512.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, it's not a difficult thing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1515.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just that we want to provide appropriate notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1519.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nothing wrong with providing appropriate notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1521.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And people can make up their own mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1524.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they believe that this is in their best interest, then fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1527.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they don't believe it's in their best interest,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1530.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: then that's a choice they can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1532.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that's what we're involved with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1534.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The statute is not a difficult one to accept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=1536.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really a question of how we have people access it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2336.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, and Reverend, I think it's really important, given the climate that sometimes pervades our world,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2346.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we reemphasize not only to ourselves as adults, but to the students, that this is important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2353.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when the adults make a motion of this type, you're sending a message to the young people who perhaps have not thought it through as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2360.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important for us to be able to say this is something that the adults have taken an active stand on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2366.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's another reason for doing it in a public body, and especially in a school system, where we have the care and responsibility of educating our young people about how to get along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2378.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've talked a lot about social and emotional health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2381.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked a lot about some of the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2382.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have to tell you, the academic issues will take care of themselves over the years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2386.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ones that won't are the social and emotional<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2390.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the personal interactions of young people if we don't step up as role models, if we don't step up as voices to help them find voice as they grow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2402.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So to help them with their transition to adulthood, it's critical that we take visible stands on human issues, human rights, and human fairness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2793.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam members of the committee, Baco Sierra is unable to be with us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=2798.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's not feeling well, but we have a terrific substitute, our deputy superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3238.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, just one comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3241.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just want to remind you that on the 14th, you've all been invited to the science museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3247.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you haven't got the thing on the, uh, the global scholars program, and that's going to intersect with the Bloomberg gift to the science museum on science innovation and innovation around the world, how our middle school students are talking to students from around the world on scientific issues like the digital environment, water,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3267.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3268.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're invited to participate and to watch and that's on the 14th and we'll reemphasize that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3275.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another aspect of how, you know, science gets integrated into a lot of other activities as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=3330.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, making a second appearance on credit recovery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4084.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And now the members of the committee will call upon our assistant superintendent and our supervisor of physical education and health to inform you about this progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4390.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try and answer it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4391.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, a couple of weeks ago we gave you a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4395.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: draft of a reasonable use policy with regard to technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4400.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We pulled it off the table because there was some information that came to us from the ACLU and some other people that we wanted to review to ensure that we didn't miss anything and that we had it properly looked at legally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4414.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can control how devices are used in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4418.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't control what people do on their own, you know, privately as long as it doesn't affect or harass other students or result in bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4426.902s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly the curriculum can talk about these things in the communication and the hostility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4433.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also the community conversations issue, you know, really speaks to this about people saying things, whether it's about sex or it's about hate or other forms of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4441.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: inappropriate conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4443.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it will all come to play through the curriculum, but I think at the same token, you know, our reasonable use policy, when we reemerge it, possibly as early as next meeting, I just want to make sure that it's right, we've vetted it with enough legal, and maybe the first of the year if we want to take a little bit more time, we'll speak to the issue of use of devices in schools and, you know, suggestions as to what young people should not be doing with their devices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4487.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there shouldn't be any use of that device for that purpose during the school day in the school setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4492.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it does happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4493.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that in of itself would be a violation of the reasonable use policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4497.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that should be forbidden for use during the day of anything like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4502.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if it happens outside, you know, it's kind of hard to police that unless it results in some form of bullying or inappropriate harassment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4512.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, but you have to be real about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4514.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we don't control what people do on the street outside of us, except if we are told that it affects how one student interacts with another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4523.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as the education side, we can bring that up through the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4530.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4655.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can introduce the term sexting because that would be a common application of communication issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4662.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it's a problem doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4665.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think the education side is one side, and the technical side is the other side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4669.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it comes together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4671.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not like we're ignoring one or the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4827.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can set that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4828.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Rachel, I think the assumption here is that there is nothing going on at the middle school in health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4831.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think maybe you should talk a little bit about what we are doing in the middle school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4834.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4834.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I think to somehow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4836.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that you see an elementary piece and a high school piece, but we haven't talked about the middle school piece.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4863.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of the things that we've got to understand is a common thread that runs through everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4868.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How do young people make good decisions about anything, whether it's alcohol, sex?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4876.74s">[Roy Belson]</a>: behavior towards others, race, things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4880.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The whole concept of all these curricula deals with the issue of good decision making.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4885.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How you are responsible to yourself and others as you move through, regardless of the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4891.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that's really the common thread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4893.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe we just simply have to weave in some additional content is really what you're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4900.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that we can give people at least an introduction to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=4904.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: since it seems to be a concern that may be emergent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5028.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Deputy Superintendent will comment on that if you need additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5034.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why don't we announce the date because I think it's important that parents know so they can plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5064.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I picked the Monday because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5070.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want the continuity of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5073.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to have it on the Wednesday, you come to school for two days and then you have day off and then you go another two days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5078.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it breaks up the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5080.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incumbent upon the faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5081.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's incumbent upon students not to use this as an excuse to extend the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5086.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to make that clear to them, but I think it's important that we not lose four days consecutively and just simply have two days, break it up in the middle of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5093.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then it really doesn't help us in terms of keeping momentum going in classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5113.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, there's a lot going on in the evaluation process at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5119.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's going back and forth between the Teachers Association, the MASC, the MASS, the commissioner's office, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5126.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we want to keep you informed because it's a hot topic right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5130.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want you to understand where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5133.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was a proposed change that the commissioner brought to the attention of the DESE board this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5140.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Commissioner Chester introduced a change that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5145.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: because of the feedback he was getting from the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5148.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one was really happy with the way it was set up previously, that there would be a student impact rating that was independent of the regular rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5159.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he came up with an approach that would embed it in standard two, so it would be part of the standard two rating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5167.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Teachers Association, as you can see from what's been attached, is adamantly opposed to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5173.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MASS and the MASC believe it's workable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5177.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The board has sent it out for public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5180.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Over the next couple of months, there'll be public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5183.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll see what actually takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5185.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's an important element of public policy, because obviously, there's got to be some form of teacher evaluation going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5192.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the question is, is that, is student learning a legitimate element of determining how effective a teacher is in the classroom?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5199.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it shouldn't be so plastic that the teacher who works with the most challenged of students is expected to have the same results as the teachers working with the gifted and talented student who self-motivates and teaches themselves in some ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5215.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Albeit, good teachers inspire anybody at any level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5219.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, the debate is very sharp right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5223.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it reflects a great deal of back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5227.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm not sure exactly how it's going to end up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5231.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will tell you that it is tying us up in terms of dealing with the Teachers Association, in terms of coming up with new ideas as to how to properly evaluate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5241.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It does create a back and forth between the associations in the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5249.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it clearly is a topic that we are going to hear more and more about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5253.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to keep you informed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5254.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want you to know what people are saying, what happened at the board, what happened with the memo you have from the Teacher's Association, both from the MTA and the AFT, although it's on MTA stationary, as to what their objections are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5267.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll continue to talk about this, because the way we evaluate teachers, the way we set goals for performance is very important to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5277.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And how we measure that is also very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5281.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it will affect personnel decisions going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5284.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think the rest of it is self-explanatory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5303.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Christine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5308.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, Patterson is doing a great job and, uh, stepping in, uh, so quickly and, uh, we're going to report on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5454.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, one of the things, I'll just say this as a commentary on what's going on, we don't know what the federal policy is going to be going into next year with regard to USDA reimbursements to the state and to us, the supply of commodities and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5472.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could change at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5475.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's some uncertainty on that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5478.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to deal also with the fact that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5482.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The price of food in local markets, we have some issues with regard to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5486.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll go up farm to school and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5488.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want farm fresh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5489.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want certain kinds of food.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5491.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to be careful about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5492.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But so far, the food service program is doing fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5495.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll monitor that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5496.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our goal would be not to raise prices unless we absolutely have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5500.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to give you as much advance notice as we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5502.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I appreciate what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5542.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5542.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5543.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I will point out to you that more and more of our students are becoming eligible for free and reduced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5550.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have, there's two schools that received equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5552.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They had to have at least 50% of the student body eligible in order to even apply for the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5558.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the others aren't too far behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5559.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's only one school that's really kind of, you know, doesn't have that economic, but most of the others are starting to head towards that 50% threshold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5568.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's simply the nature of the demographic in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5570.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we are conscious of that very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5577.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some kids will never tell you because they don't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5580.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, some families won't, but more and more we're paying attention to that because obviously it affects us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5586.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of the reason that prices had to be raised, just so we can remind ourselves of this, was the fact that the USDA insisted that we charge at least as much as they were reimbursing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5596.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They weren't going to reimburse us more money than we were charging ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5600.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was an important thing to bring it up, so we had to actually bring it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5604.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the point is well taken, and we'll follow up, and we'll try to do the best we can in giving a word out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5758.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in our last meeting you asked me to draft a letter from you to our legislative delegation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5763.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have done so and you, you know, got a chance hopefully to look it over so that we can send it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5768.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to bring you up to date on a couple more things that have since emerged with that law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5773.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did attach<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5774.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: an advisory from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, legal counsel, which went into a great deal of depth about some of the legal challenges in implementing this law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5786.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also had the opportunity today to meet with the State Treasurer as part of the Economic Empowerment Task Force, which I serve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5795.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: about the implementation because the implementation comes under her jurisdiction, at least at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5800.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you may know, there's no money that's been allocated in the current budget for it and the current collections have gone down this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5806.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's hard to know where that new money is coming and there's no consensus to borrow from the rainy day fund from either the governor or the speaker of the house or the state treasurer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5816.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's unlikely that this will be off and running very soon because they, they need money to set up the apparatus to do the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5824.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the kinds of things that are necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5826.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Still, we should be on record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5828.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition, we should also note that there are some interesting federal laws that are going to intersect with this right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5836.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is the Drug-Free Schools Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5839.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the Communities Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5841.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's also, you know, a discussion of states' rights versus federal supremacy clause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5848.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Under the federal supremacy clause, federal laws take precedent over state laws, unless they're covered by the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which reserves rights to the state that are not enumerated for the federal government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5862.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But depending on the court,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5864.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It really depends on what the judges want to rule at any one time because it's gone both ways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5869.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's entirely possible that the incoming Attorney General, who has been very strong in his advocacy against marijuana, recreational or medical, in his home state,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5880.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and in the Senate, may actually take a more aggressive stance than the current Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5888.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot going on as to how this stuff is going to play out in the national and the local scene in the upcoming months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5896.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing, too, that maybe people don't fully realize is that because it's a federal crime, money's collected for this revenue from the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5906.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: from marijuana can't be deposited in a federal bank, because it's a criminal act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5915.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Multiple levels of different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5916.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, all kinds of, but you know, there's going to be, it's going to be very interesting to see how they play with that, because with a new, if you will, sheriff in town, and they get to stay in the White House, it could very well be a very difficult thing that goes forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5929.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the interim,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5931.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't hurt for us to be on record with the letter that I've drafted for you or any amendments you want to make to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5937.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that it's going to be a little while before we start to see this take place and where it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5978.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of quick things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5979.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, again, tomorrow at 1230 is groundbreaking at the Community Access Channel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5986.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be hosted in part<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5988.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by the mayor, by Lisa Hughes from Channel 4, Courtney Cox from Nessun, and a number of other people from the media coming to see us in action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=5998.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will be a good opportunity to see how this thing is progressing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6001.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of good work is going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6002.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christina has been working real hard with city officials to ensure that the construction goes forward and that the necessary modifications are made so that things go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6012.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but tomorrow's an opportunity to see things from the actual site and to get some reports at that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6021.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you two articles from Time Magazine, which was referenced by Paulette a short time ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6028.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're worth reading because I think what's important is that we stay up on what's being said out there so we can have the dialogues necessary to guide the future directions of our resources and our curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6040.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should be noted that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6043.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The President-elect has named an incoming U.S.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6045.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secretary of Education, Elizabeth Betsy DeVos of Michigan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6049.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's an active supporter of school choice, charters, and vouchers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6053.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She also has announced that she's against the Common Core.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6057.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll see where that happens, what that means, but, you know, getting back to the Supremacy Clause versus states' rights, all those kinds of things have to be worked out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6066.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's going to be very interesting to see, especially coming off the most recent<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6072.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: initiative petition in the Commonwealth as to what kinds of incentives will be made to the communities, states, you know, to expand choice and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6082.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Massachusetts Constitution forbids certain types of activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6085.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6087.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's hard to know how it will all intersect, but it bears watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6091.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are just a few items to bring to your attention, and hopefully you can participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/St6-eFlV02k&t=6096.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, on the 14th, if you intend to go, let us know so we can arrange for parking and the other things for you at the Science Museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=346.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this project has been going on for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=350.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, once again, the Governor's Office, through its Project 351, is sponsoring student ambassadors from our middle schools to attend a project activity on Martin Luther King Day and then do a year of community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=366.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call on our two principals, Paul DeLaver and Jake Edwards, if he's here, to introduce these students and talk a little bit about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=408.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have representatives from the company that runs the trip, and our deputy superintendent is prepared to answer any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=418.569s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember last year we had a trip to Ecuador, and we then had a trip to Washington, and we had some, you know, things we had to do, but we've worked on making sure that these things are in place, so let them present, and then you can ask any questions you might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1700.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Director of Humanities, Dr. Kieser, and our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccadeli, to tell us about Veterans Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1898.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2033.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2035.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The advance of technology requires that we improve our policy with regard to use of technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2043.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current policy is attached to the cover page, it's called the acceptable use policy, but it's much thinner than the one that we have developed since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2055.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, tonight we have Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena with us who work on our technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2063.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Alan is the network administrator, Richard is the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2065.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Director of Media and Technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2068.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'd like to table it tonight because some additional information has come to our attention from the ACLU and some other groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2075.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to match up the information to make sure that we've covered all the bases and make sure that there's nothing that we've missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2085.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to be careful that different groups have different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2088.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some other things that are moving forward, but we do want to address this as an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2092.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, what you have in front of you, look it over and give us any feedback you have, and we will continue to research some of the latest stuff that's come out only this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2102.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and determine whether or not we've missed anything that we think should be included or something that should be worded differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2109.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena are here if you have any preliminary questions, otherwise we recommend we lay it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2136.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, the conference was great, but our deputy superintendent is going to issue this report to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2142.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of attachments, and you'll find at the back there's also a financial accounting that was asked for at a previous meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2979.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, one of the things that, you know, was in here that you should notice is the fact that we've identified through tier 2 of the E-rate about 700,000, it could be as much as 800,000 that we can access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2991.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll start applying for that after the first year when the window opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2995.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2996.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's 60 percent of the cost of what we pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2998.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do our capital plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3000.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can hope to get as much as $800,000 against the capital plan for technology enhancements, which will be well worth the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3009.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there's a couple of other technology items in here that also are fundable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3014.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was probably the biggest financial takeaway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3017.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing was to look at roofing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3019.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think I mentioned it here a little bit, because obviously we're looking at roofing going down the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3025.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of the roofing applications now are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3028.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: very, very good and they're less expensive than some of the previous roofing and they can be done much more quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3034.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So becoming familiar with that is a real important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3038.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some legal things that are coming up that are really questionable that we need to get in front of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3044.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know that we just had an election and that with that election, ESSA is going to be looked at by a new administration, how it's going to be implemented, how it's going to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3055.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of those things were talked about in great length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3058.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were things that are still unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3061.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we just can't know, but people are speculating on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3065.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think there's a lot of takeaways from this that you just can't do when you're not talking to people face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3070.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you're talking to somebody over the telephone, the conversations, they're good, but they're not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3074.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you're talking to somebody face to face over a cup of coffee, you can get an awful lot of information, especially if they're working on this on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3517.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're making good progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3518.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, a couple of tweaks here and there, but I think we've broken through the initial gridlock of trying to get some of that stuff to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3527.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you start to see things take fuller shape in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3589.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Elementary was going to be a little bit later because they're in a different position right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3593.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't get report cards the same way the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3596.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The others do, but will roll that out fairly soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3599.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think Diane can answer that specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3724.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My pleasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3877.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as you know, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3882.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marijuana question passed the ballot in this past November by about 54% of the voters who actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3895.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the big questions, obviously, is there isn't enough regulatory guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3900.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you look at some of these ballot questions, they're very blunt instruments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3904.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can only ask for one thing up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3907.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they don't really spell out all the things that are inside that need to happen in order to make it work well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3914.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Speaker of the House,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3916.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Senate President and the Governor have all expressed their concerns, the Attorney General, about the lack of regulatory assistance that they have going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3927.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they can't do much between now and January because they're in an informal session, and all you need is one legislator to object, and the matter can't be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3937.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and obviously there are people that don't want to talk about it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3940.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I expect that in January, the legislature will take this up in earnest, and the governor will follow quickly, and there'll be a lot of support for regulatory help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3952.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Currently, it's under the state treasurer, Deborah Goldberg, for implementation, but it's unfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3960.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She has no funds for it, nor does she have any appointees to her commission, and this is scheduled to go into effect December 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3967.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's obviously some concerns about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3970.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of different concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3973.485s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously the medical marijuana piece is better regulated and that's already in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3978.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the recreational marijuana issues are not regulated at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3983.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what basically I'm saying, it's imperative that school committees, school officials urge the legislature and the governor to take the necessary action<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3994.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to prevent the misuse of this substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3999.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we talk about opiates, we talk about all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4001.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I look at marijuana as a gateway drug.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4005.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Especially when young people can get access to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4007.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the minimum age is 21, but if a 21-year-old has it, I'm not sure that he or she is going to keep it from their friend who is 16 or 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4018.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that, you know, there were issues associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4021.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, here are some of the things that I would want to write to our legislators on behalf of the committee, and there may be others that we can add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4030.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first is to provide a local opt-in provision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4034.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now it's opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4036.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in order to do it, you have to schedule a referendum vote that could be a year later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4041.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to make them put it opt-in, which means you have to, as a community, decide to actually accept the rule for your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4050.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4052.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would mirror the Colorado law, which is currently in place, and we think that's a good piece to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4057.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seventy percent of the communities in Marijuana ban their local areas for distributing it, so that's just an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4068.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is substantially increase the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4071.285s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now it's 3.75.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4073.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that rate, while it might generate some money, it won't generate enough money for enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4078.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't generate enough money for control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4080.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't generate enough money for data collection, for the kinds of things that have to go forward in order for us to modify and improve the law as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4089.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we think that the legislature should increase that tax, maybe even double it, in order to ensure that there's sufficient funds to regulate recreational marijuana.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4102.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think they should eliminate the home-grown provision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4106.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The provision as it currently stands will not adequately be enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4112.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who's to know who's going to go in whose home to get warrants to go in people's homes to see if they've only got six plants, or how they're using it, or whether they're putting it in brownies, or whether they're putting in these kinds of things and distributing it in ways that cannot be easily detected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4126.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other piece on this is that the way the marijuana is grown today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4132.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The intensity of it is much stronger than it was years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4136.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we don't know if it's going to be spiced or spliced, if you will, with other substances in certain venues that may be at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4142.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4144.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we think the homegrown piece needs to be looked at in order for us to protect underage students and underage people, or anyone in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4155.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think they need to strengthen the control commission to better understand the impact and to effectively regulate the industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4162.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The commission should have a staff that collects data to inform future modifications that may be necessary to protect public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4170.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't have data out there as to what's happening, whether there's connection between recreational marijuana use and other drug use, you don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4178.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't know if you're helping or hurting what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4182.078s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, the initiative petition process, like I say, can be a valuable part of the democratic system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4188.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, it's a very blunt instrument and it needs to be refined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4192.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously will respect the will of the people as we do with all initiative petitions, and the legislature very rarely overturns the will of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4201.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no reason why they can't modify it and refine it, and I think the interest is there on the part of the leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4207.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, what I'd like to do is draft a letter to our legislators on behalf of the committee and the school department administration with these suggestions, and hope that they will take action as swiftly as possible at the turn of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4220.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of the year when the legislature goes back into formal session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4240.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can bring that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4256.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, the state just released the disciplinary statistics from 2015-2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4263.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is well below the numbers for the state on average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4267.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some of the reports that I was able to download offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4271.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do a little bit more analysis, but we're well below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4274.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you some categories that would give you some ideas about different areas, whether it be substance abuse, marijuana, physical theft or assault or anything of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4286.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for you to look over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4288.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do a bigger report going forward but I wanted you to have something to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4293.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think some of our initiatives in terms of providing additional programs for youngsters rather than sending them home have worked and will continue to work and we need to strengthen them going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4303.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think those things are positive steps for us and I think it shows in the results and we'll continue to show in the results going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4327.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, High Needs is a conglomerate group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4330.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be economically disadvantaged, it could be special needs, it could be ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4334.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a grouping that sort of is an omnibus for all the different groups that have been identified as disaggregated groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4341.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4344.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand that, but sometimes it's hard to know who's in the group because you don't know who they've included in the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4351.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's pretty much the youngsters who fall into groups like special needs, EOL, economically disadvantaged, and some other groups that might be lesser known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4382.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure, we will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4384.244s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you know, we've talked about this as adding programs, these opportunities for change and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4390.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are alternative insides which keep kids from being, let's say, sent home and given some additional help or counseling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4396.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we're pushing towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4397.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we're going to try to keep doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4400.187s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Budget's permitting, obviously, and I think that that's reflected in our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4436.512s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why the emphasis on social emotional learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4438.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4461.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was the opportunities for change program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4484.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Probably halfway through the year, let's give it a half a year to really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4490.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: – Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4522.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will break it down further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4523.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came out just at the end of the week, and we just sort of wanted to get it out because it was being announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4528.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at the same token, we have more time to break it down now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4565.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I received a number of phone calls from a number of you and others with regard to the election results that took place on November 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4573.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And school systems around the Commonwealth and around the country received multiple inquiries from parents and citizens regarding classroom discussions about the recent national election results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4584.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and concerns were raised about some teachers or staff who might introduce their personal opinions and feelings into what might be considered a very charged current topic leading to possible conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4599.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we know, elections are a fundamental element of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4602.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The process of elections and the substantive issues are a legitimate part of citizenship education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4608.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't eliminate either process or substance from our schools and our classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4614.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Naturally, discussions must be age-appropriate and devoid of any hostility for expressions of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4620.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There can be no discussions that are racist and discriminatory towards any group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4625.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and adult personnel must ensure that inappropriate comments are not introduced or perpetuated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4631.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday morning, November 9th, I sent out an email to principals, which is listed here, and I wanted to read it so the public did not see it, they understand this, because you've asked me sometimes, do people know this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4644.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to put it out, but obviously not everybody reads everything that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4651.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I wrote, colleagues, last evening citizens elected a new president of our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4655.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I recognize this election was extremely contentious and polarizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4659.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Undoubtedly, there were many strong feelings among faculty, staff, and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4663.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's extremely important that we do not engage in divisive discussions that can inflame feelings and behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4669.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As educators, we must strive to help our students understand that we have a democratic process and that we need to go forward in a constructive way to support our country and our own people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4679.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no room for hate messaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4681.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our students must learn that in this country we accept the constitutional process that transfers power after a legitimate election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4688.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This does not mean there can be no discussion of the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4692.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any discussion must be respectful and constructive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4695.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for your attention to this guidance, and I signed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4698.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our principals were expected to instruct their faculty and staff of the above expectation, and I have not received any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4705.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: information from principles that inappropriate discussions have taken place in our classrooms at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4710.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll continue to emphasize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4711.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll continue to allow people to discuss the electoral process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4715.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to discuss the electoral college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4716.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to discuss<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4717.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Popular votes, they want to discuss states, they want to look at reasons why people vote, that's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4722.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no room in the schools, in the classroom for adult personnel to encourage students to be hostile about any result or in the light we have, we have to get on with business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4734.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the message that's out there and we'll continue to monitor what takes place over the next while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4803.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's going to be June 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4814.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, we do this in part this early, and I'll tell you why we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4817.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not only to help people plan, but once we lock into a date, if it snows, we still can get the days in, you know, even if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4826.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're on 12 days between graduation and the last day for seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4831.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we walk in with the state in case we have extra snow days and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4835.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why we do it so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4855.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do we have old business, but it wasn't listed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4858.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's two items there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4859.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is the crossing guards, and the other is how it's been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4863.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not listed for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4863.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It didn't get printed for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4998.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Representative Donato emailed me back today saying his meeting is scheduled for next for the first week in December with DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5007.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he's going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5008.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, on this particular thing, my handwriting undoubtedly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5013.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5015.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5016.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5016.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5016.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5016.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5017.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5034.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5087.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for your consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5108.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do have a copy of it, you know, that you requested this and it takes a while for us to get answers from Ethics, but here it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5387.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So by our rules, people who have extended use of our facilities can negotiate some of the rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5393.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's by our rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5395.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we take about $60,000 a year from them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5398.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for about five sessions of, you know, maybe 20 courses that are run during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5402.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's pretty consistent with what, you know, our revenue would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5407.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we obviously update it over time as they use facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5411.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they use more facilities, we'll charge them more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5412.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they use less, we'll obviously modify it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5415.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we consider that, you know, consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5429.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, at this point in time, I don't think there's anyone in our faculty or administration that's actually teaching a course right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5436.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I mean, it happens sporadically, but if it happens, it could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5445.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5446.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only contact that we do with them is through our offices to set up the contract for use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5451.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then after that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5453.186s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they want someone, and the person has to be selected by them, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5456.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have any, let's say, ability to influence who they select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5462.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't tell them who can teach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5465.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who can't teach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5490.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of quick things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5492.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to pass this out to each of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5496.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a, something that I, let me pass it down, something that I acquired yesterday when I was in Newport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5506.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a good timing kind of thing because what it is is a letter from George Washington to the first Jewish synagogue in America in Newport, Rhode Island, but there's also references to Washington speaking to other congregations of other denominations in 1890, 1790 rather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5538.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Washington at the time was asked whether or not there would be any discrimination in America against religion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5546.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read the letter from Washington, which is perhaps one of the most famous letters of all time, and I wanted to share it with you because I've got copies, he basically said that in this country, you're going to get the actual wording,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5574.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that there would be no, you know, toleration of bigotry, and there would be no allowance for discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5586.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a very useful kind of thing because it predates the signing of the Bill of Rights by one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5593.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 18, not 18, I keep saying 18, 1791, New Jersey, on the same date as yesterday, the 19th of November,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5605.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: was the first state to sign the Bill of Rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5608.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we go through a period where we sometimes hear people saying things, you know, about hatred and other issues that we talked about tonight, it goes right back to George Washington, who says basically, for happily the government of the United States will give no bigotry, will give bigotry no sanction, and to persecution no assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5632.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: requires that only they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving all the occasions of their effectual support."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5643.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he's basically saying, no bigotry, no discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5647.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's absolutely totally appropriate at this time as we see some of the hateful activity that sometimes has found its way into our country in recent times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5656.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just thought you might enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5658.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also some listings of other congregations that he spoke to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5662.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's quite impressive that this place survived as long as it is in its original form, pretty much original form, going through several periods where it was not allowed to exist by different groups, by the British and by others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5677.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just something that you might have and could use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5682.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5684.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I just want to mention is in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5688.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Susan Altman, who did the mural at the Roberts, also did a mural for the Family Network recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5695.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gorgeous, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5696.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you get a chance, go take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5699.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The kids did the mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5703.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She guided the mural, and it was really terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5706.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I saw it the other day, and really, it shows a transformation of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5712.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How things work, how families work and transform themselves, how communities transform themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5718.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's quite something to be seen and it will be displayed in the family network in this hole in the wall that they had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5725.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a hole in the wall project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5729.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plus, you just received... And if I could, on Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5755.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you also know that tomorrow the Curtis Tufts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5758.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5760.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Starting at 11.30 for hors d'oeuvres and 12 o'clock for their annual dinner or luncheon, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5767.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, you're all invited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5771.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pep rally is on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5773.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it starts at 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5776.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5777.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, of course, on Thursday, we'll, of course, beat Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5780.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, why wouldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5782.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5785.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, we have some other papers, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=221.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this project has been going on for a number of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=226.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year, once again, the governor's office and through its project 351<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=232.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is sponsoring student ambassadors from our middle schools to attend a project activity on Martin Luther King Day and then do a year of community service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=242.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call on our two principals, Paul DeLaver and Jake Edwards, if he's here, to introduce these students and talk a little bit about the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=284.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have representatives from the company that runs the trip and our deputy superintendent is prepared to answer any questions you may have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=294.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember last year we had a trip to Ecuador and we then had a trip to Washington and we had some things we have to do, but we've worked on making sure that these things are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=303.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let them present and then you can ask any questions you might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1576.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Director of Humanities, Dr. Piazza, and the Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccardoli, to tell us about Veterans Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1773.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1908.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't remember members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1910.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, the advance of technology requires that we improve our policy with regard to use of technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1918.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the current policy is attached to the cover page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1921.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's called the acceptable use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1923.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: policy, but it's much thinner than the one that we have developed since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1931.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, tonight we have Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena with us who work on our technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1938.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Alan is the network administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1940.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Richard is the director of media and technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1943.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'd like to table it tonight because some additional information has come to our attention from the ACLU and some other groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1951.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to match up the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1952.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: information to make sure that we've covered all the bases and make sure that there's nothing that we've missed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1959.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to be careful that different groups have different issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1964.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some other things that are moving forward, but we do want to address this as an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1968.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you have in front of you, look it over and give us any feedback you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1973.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will continue to research some of the latest stuff that's come out only this past week and determine whether or not we've missed anything that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1982.141s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we think should be included or something that should be worded differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1985.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena are here if you have any preliminary questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=1989.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, I recommend we lay it on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2011.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, um, conference was great, but our deputy superintendent is going to issue this report to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2018.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of attachments and you'll find at the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2021.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's also a financial accounting that was asked for the previous meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2855.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, one of the things that, you know, was in here that you should notice is the fact that we've identified through tier two of the E-rate about 700,000, it could be as much as 800,000 that we can access.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2867.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll start applying for that after the first year when the window opens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2871.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a match.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2872.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's 60% of the cost of what we pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2874.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we do our capital plan,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2876.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we can hope to get as much as $800,000 against the capital plan for technology enhancements, which will be well worth the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2885.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then there's a couple of other technology items in here that also are fundable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2890.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that was a, probably the biggest financial takeaway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2893.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing was to look at roofing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2895.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think I mentioned it in here a little bit, uh, because obviously we were looking at roofing going down, down the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2901.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of the roofing applications now are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2904.498s">[Roy Belson]</a>: very, very good and they're less expensive than some of the previous roofing and they can be done much more quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2910.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So becoming familiar with that is a real important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2914.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, there are some legal things that are coming up that are really questionable that we need to get in front of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2919.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, you know that we just had an election and that with that election, ESSA is, you know, is going to be looked at by a new administration, how it's going to be implemented, how it's going to be changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2931.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, some of those things were talked about in great length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2934.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, there are things that are still unknown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2935.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, you know, we, we just can't know, but people are speculating on them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2940.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think there's a lot of takeaways from this that you just can't do when you're not talking to people face to face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2946.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you're talking to somebody over the telephone, the conversations, they're good, but they're not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=2950.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you're talking to somebody face to face over a cup of coffee, you can get an awful lot of information, especially if they're working on this, uh, on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3393.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're making good progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3394.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, a couple of tweaks here and there, but I think we've broken through the initial gridlock of trying to get some of that stuff to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3402.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think you start to see things take fuller shape in the next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3464.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: elementary elementary, you know, it was going to be a little bit later because they're in a different position right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3469.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't get report cards the same way the, uh, the others do, but, uh, we'll roll that out, uh, fairly soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3475.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think Diane can answer that specifically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3753.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3754.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, as you know, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3758.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Marijuana question passed the ballot in this past November by about 54% of the voters who actually voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3771.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the big questions, obviously, is there isn't enough regulatory guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3776.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you look at some of these ballot questions, they're very blunt instruments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3780.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They can only ask for one thing up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3782.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they don't really spell out all the things that are inside that need to happen in order to make it work well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3790.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Speaker of the House, the Senate President, and the Governor have all expressed their concerns, the Attorney General.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3797.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: about the lack of regulatory assistance that they have going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3803.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they can't do much between now and January because they're in an informal session and all you need is one legislator to object and the matter can't be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3813.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously there are people that don't want to talk about it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3816.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I expect that in January, uh, the legislature will take this up in earnest and the governor will fall quickly and there'll be a lot of support for regulatory, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3827.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3828.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, currently it's under the state treasurer, Deborah Goldberg for implementation, but it's unfunded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3836.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She has no funds for it in order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3837.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She have any appointees to her commission and this is scheduled to go in effect December 15th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3841.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3844.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's obviously some concerns about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3846.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of different concerns that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3849.295s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, obviously, the medical marijuana piece is better regulated, and that's already in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3854.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the recreational marijuana issues are not regulated at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3859.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what basically I'm saying, it's imperative that school committees, school officials urge the legislature and the governor to take the necessary action to prevent the misuse of this substance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3875.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we talk about opiates, we talk about all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3877.339s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I look at marijuana as a gateway drug, especially when young people can get access to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3883.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the minimum age is 21, but if a 21-year-old has it, I'm not sure that he or she is going to keep it from their friend who is 16 or 17.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3893.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I have a feeling that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3895.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there were issues associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3897.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So here are some of the things that I would want to write to our legislators on behalf of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3904.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be others that we can add to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3906.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the first is to provide a local opt-in provision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3910.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now, it's opt-out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3911.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in order to do it, you have to schedule a referendum vote that could be a year later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3917.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I want to make them put it opt-in, which means you have to, as a community, decide to actually accept the rule for your community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3926.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3927.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would mirror the Colorado law, which is currently in place, and we think that's a good piece to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3934.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 70% of the communities in Marijuana ban their local areas for distributing it, so that's just an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3943.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The second thing is substantially increase the tax rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3947.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right now it's 3.75.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3949.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At that rate, while it might generate some money, it won't generate enough money for enforcement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3954.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't generate enough money for control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3956.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't generate enough money for data collection, for the kinds of things that have to go forward in order for us to modify and improve the law as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3965.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we think that the legislature should increase that tax, maybe even double it, in order to ensure that there's sufficient funds to regulate recreational marijuana.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3978.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think they should eliminate the homegrown provision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3982.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The provision as it currently stands will not adequately be enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=3987.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Who's to know who's going to go in whose home, and to get warrants to go in people's homes to see if they've only got six plants, or how they're using it, or whether they're putting it in brownies, or whether they're putting in these kinds of things and distributing it in ways that cannot be easily detected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4002.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other piece on this is that the way the marijuana is grown today,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4008.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The intensity of it is much stronger than it was years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4011.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we don't know if it's going to be spiced or spliced, if you will, with other substances in certain venues that may be at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4018.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4020.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we think the homegrown piece needs to be looked at in order for us to protect underage students and underage people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4029.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or anyone in particular.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4031.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think they need to strengthen the Control Commission to better understand the impact and to effectively regulate the industry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4039.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Commission should have a staff that collects data to inform future modifications that may be necessary to protect public safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4045.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't have data out there as to what's happening, whether there's connection between recreational marijuana use and other drug use, you don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4053.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't know if you're helping or hurting what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4057.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the initiative petition process, like I say, can be a valuable part of the democratic system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4063.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, it's a very blunt instrument, and it needs to be refined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4068.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We obviously<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4069.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: will respect the will of the people, as we do with all initiative petitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4073.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the legislature very rarely overturns the will of the people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4077.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no reason why they can't modify it and refine it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4080.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think the interest is there on the part of the leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4083.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what I'd like to do is draft a letter to our legislators on behalf of the committee and the school department administration with these suggestions and hope that they will take action as swiftly as possible at the turn of the year when the legislature goes back into formal session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4116.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can bring that to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4132.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the state just released the disciplinary statistics from 2015-2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4139.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is well below the numbers for the state on average.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4143.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you some of the reports that I was able to download offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4147.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to do a little bit more analysis, but we're well below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4150.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you some categories that would give you some ideas about different areas, whether it be substance abuse, marijuana, physical theft or assault or anything of that type for you to look over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4164.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do a bigger report going forward, but I wanted you to have something to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4169.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think some of our initiatives in terms of providing additional programs for youngsters, rather than sending them home, have worked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4176.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll continue to work, and we need to strengthen them going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4179.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think those things are positive steps for us, and I think it shows in the results, and we'll continue to show in the results going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4203.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, high needs as a, as a conglomerate group, it could be economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4207.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It could be special needs could be ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4210.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, it's, it's a grouping that sort of as an omnibus for all the different groups that are identified as disaggregated groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4217.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh, we try to, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4220.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4222.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But sometimes it's hard to know who's in the group because you don't know who they've included in the group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4227.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's pretty much the youngsters who fall into groups like special needs, EOL, economically disadvantaged and some other groups that might be lesser known.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4259.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4260.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you know, we've talked about this as adding programs, these, you know, opportunities for opportunities for change and things like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4265.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are alternative insights which keep kids from being, let's say sent home and given some additional help or counseling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4271.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's what we're pushing towards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4273.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what we're going to try to keep doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4275.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, budgets permitting obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4277.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh, I think that that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4279.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: reflected in our numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4359.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know probably halfway through the year Let's give it a half a year to really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4366.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4398.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will break it down further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4399.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This came out just at the end of the week, and we just sort of wanted to get it out because it was being announced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4404.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at the same token, we have more time to break it down now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4441.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I received a number of phone calls from a number of you and others with regard to the election results that took place on November 8th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4449.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And school systems around the Commonwealth and around the country received multiple inquiries from parents and citizens regarding classroom discussions about the recent national election results.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4460.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And concerns were raised about some teachers or staff who might introduce their personal opinions and feelings into what might be considered a very charged current<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4470.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: topic leading to possible conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4475.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we know, elections are a fundamental element of democracy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4478.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The process of elections and the substantive issues are a legitimate part of citizenship education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4484.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't eliminate either process or substance from our schools and our classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4489.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And naturally, discussions must be age appropriate and devoid of any hostility for expressions of opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4496.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There can be no discussions that are racist and discriminatory towards any group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4501.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And adult personnel must ensure that inappropriate comments are not introduced or perpetuated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4507.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday morning, November 9th, I sent out an email to principals, which is listed here, and I wanted to read it so if the public did not see it, they understand, because you've asked me sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4519.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do people know this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4520.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, we try to put it out, but obviously not everybody reads everything that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4526.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I wrote, colleagues, last evening, citizens elected a new president of our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4531.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I recognize this election was extremely contentious and polarizing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4535.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Undoubtedly, there are many strong feelings among faculty, staff, and students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4539.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's extremely important that we do not engage in divisive discussions that can inflame feelings and behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4545.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As educators, we must strive to help our students understand<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4548.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we have a democratic process and that we need to go forward in a constructive way to support our country and our people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4555.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no room for hate messaging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4557.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our students must learn that in this country, we accept the constitutional process that transfers power after a legitimate election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4564.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This does not mean there can be no discussion of the election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4567.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any discussion must be respectful and constructive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4571.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for your attention to this guidance, and I signed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4574.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our principals were expected to instruct their faculty and staff of the above expectation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4579.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I've not received any information from principals that inappropriate discussions have taken place in our classrooms at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4585.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll continue to emphasize this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4587.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll continue to allow people to discuss the electoral process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4590.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to discuss the electoral college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4592.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to discuss popular votes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4594.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to discuss states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4595.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They want to look at reasons why people vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4597.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4598.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no room in the schools, in the classroom for adult personnel to encourage students to be hostile about any result or in the light we have, we have to get on with business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4610.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the message that's out there and we'll continue to monitor what takes place over the next while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4679.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: June 7th at the Gancher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4690.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, we do this in part this early, and I'll tell you why we do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4693.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not only to help people plan, but once we walk into a day, if it snows, we still can get the days in, you know, even if the even if the there aren't 12 days between graduation and the last day for seniors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4706.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we walk in with the state in case we have extra snow days and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4710.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why we do it so quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4730.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do we have old business, but it wasn't listed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4734.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's two items there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4735.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One is the crossing guards, and the other is how it's paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4738.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not listed for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4873.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Representative Donato emailed me back today saying his meeting is scheduled for next for the first week in December with DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4883.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he's going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4884.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the way, on this particular thing, my handwriting undoubtedly, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4889.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get Donahue to speak up for us as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=4984.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you have a copy of it, you know, that you requested this and it takes a while for us to get answers from ethics, but there was a question about a potential conflict of interest in regards to American International College, AIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5263.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So by our rules, people who have extended use of our facilities can negotiate some of the rates, that's by our rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5270.905s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we take about $60,000 a year from them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5274.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for about five sessions of maybe 20 courses that are run during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5278.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's pretty consistent with what our revenue would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5283.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we obviously update it over time as they use facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5286.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they use more facilities, we'll charge them more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5288.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they use less, we'll obviously modify it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5290.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we consider that consistent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5304.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, at this point in time, I don't think there's anyone in our faculty or administration that's actually teaching a course right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5311.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I mean, it happens sporadically, but if it happens, it could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5320.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5322.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only contact that we do with them is through our offices to set up the contract for use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5327.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then after that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5329.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they want someone or the person has to be selected by them, by the way, we don't have any, any, let's say ability to influence who they select.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5338.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, so I don't tell them who to tell you who can teach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5366.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of quick things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5367.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, I want to pass this out to each of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5370.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, this is a, um, something that I want to pass it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5376.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something that I acquired yesterday when I was in Newport.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5380.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5381.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a good timing kind of thing, because what it is is a letter from George Washington to the first Jewish synagogue in America in Newport, Rhode Island.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5396.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's also references to Washington speaking to other congregations of other denominations in 1890, 1790, rather.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5410.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's particularly appropriate because Washington at the time was asked whether or not there would be any discrimination in America against religion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5422.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you read the letter from Washington, which is perhaps one of the most famous letters of all time, and I wanted to share it with you because I've got copies, he basically said that in this country, he's going to get the actual<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5440.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: wording that there would be no toleration of bigotry and there would be no allowance for discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5462.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a very useful kind of thing because it predates the signing of the Bill of Rights by one year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5473.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In 1791, New Jersey, on the same date as yesterday, the 19th of November, was the first state to sign the Bill of Rights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5484.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as we go through a period where we sometimes hear people saying things about hatred and other issues that we talked about tonight, it goes right back to George Washington, who says basically,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5499.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For happily, the government of the United States will give bigotry no sanction, and to persecution no assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5508.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It requires that only they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving all the occasions of their effectual support."<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5519.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So he's basically saying, no bigotry, no discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5523.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's absolutely totally appropriate at this time as we see some of the hateful activity that sometimes has found its way<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5531.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: into our country in recent times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5532.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I just thought you might enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5534.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also some listings of other congregations that he spoke to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5538.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's quite impressive that this place survived as long as it is in its original form, pretty much original form, going through several periods where it was not allowed to exist by different groups, by the British and by others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5553.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just something that you might have and could use<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5557.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5559.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another thing that I just want to mention is in your folder.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5564.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Susan Altman, who did the mural at the Roberts, also did a mural for the Family Network recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5570.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gorgeous, beautiful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5572.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you get a chance, go take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5575.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The kids did the mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5579.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She guided the mural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5580.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was really terrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5581.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I saw it the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5583.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And really, it shows a transformation of, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5588.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of how things work, how families work and transform themselves, how communities transform themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5593.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's quite, quite something to be seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5595.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it'll be displayed in the family network, uh, in this hole in the wall that they had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5601.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's the hole in the wall project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5603.291s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think you, um, should see a plus you've just received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5631.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you also know that tomorrow, the Curtis Tufts is lunching, starting at 11.30 for hors d'oeuvres and 12 o'clock for their annual dinner or luncheon, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5642.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5644.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're all invited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5647.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pep rally is on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5649.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it starts at 11 o'clock, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5652.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, on Thursday, we'll, of course, beat Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5656.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, why wouldn't we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5658.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At Malden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5661.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, we have some other papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sDIP3q77Fyw&t=5662.335s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=876.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I find it more effective sometimes to talk directly to the people because you can cover the subject, the letter is a paragraph or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=884.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the things that did take place in the last week or so, which I think is encouraging,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=889.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: yw'r ffaith bod y cyfrifiad o'r wlad wedi mynd i fyny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=892.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ac oherwydd mae'r cyfrifiad wedi mynd i fyny, rwy'n siŵr bod llawer o'r awdurdodau yma yn dweud, na allwn i'n baratoi unrhyw arian oherwydd rwy'n mynd i'n cael ychydig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=899.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nid ydw i'n cael cyfrifiad o unrhyw un.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=901.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, os bydd cyfrifiad yn dal i fod yn solid ar y wlad, os gallwn ei weld arall, rwy'n sylweddoli y byddai rhywbeth fel DCR yn dweud, na, ok, rwy'n gallu cyfrifiad yma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=908.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ond mae llawer o'r awdurdodau yma sy'n bwysig<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=917.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ac yr hyn sy'n digwydd yw eu bod yn sefyllfa lle byddan nhw'n ysgrifennu am arian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=921.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, wrth i'r sefyllfa ffisgol sefydlu, mae'r Llywodraeth wedi'i ddod yn ôl yn ei gofyn i ddechrau'r cutau 9C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=928.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r Llywodraeth wedi'i gofyn iddyn nhw ddod yn ôl ar y gofyn hwnnw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=933.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r cyllidebion ar gyfer y mlynedd hwnnw'n llawer mwy gryf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=935.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mewn gwirionedd, maen nhw'n cyrraedd eu targedau ar hyn o bryd, maen nhw'n ychydig o ddollaraethau, ond maen nhw'n gobeithio anhygoel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=948.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Roedden nhw'n ymwneud â'r ffordd ymhreisio, felly dyna'r rhan o'r cyfrifiad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=951.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, gobeithio, rydyn ni'n ei gael ar y cyfnod da.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=953.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni'n dweud, edrychwch, rydych chi'n bwysig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=955.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dyma rhywbeth sy'n anodd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=1611.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fel rydych chi'n gwybod, rydyn ni wedi cael ychydig o dransiadau, felly mae Christine wedi bod ym mhob amser.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2373.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rwy'n gwybod bod yna bobl arall na'n myfyrwyr ein hunain sy'n dod.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2404.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we gave a previous report on this and I just want to get you the follow-up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2409.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony Vento was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2411.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She did a great job getting this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2413.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have the report in front of you so you don't have to go in great detail, but it was successful in getting most of the students and most of the people who were identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2421.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there were only three people that did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2424.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony, come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2427.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny, ychydig o hynny<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=2657.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, we're going to call upon our Director or Principal of the Vocational School to update us on this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=3175.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dydyn ni ddim yn gofyn i unrhyw un ysgrifennu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=3181.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ar ddechrau ysgol dydd, os eisiau iddyn nhw dynnu'r gofyn a gwneud rhywbeth, mae'n iawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FmrA4M646Vo&t=3184.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ond dydyn ni ddim yn meddwl... Nid yw unrhyw beth yn fformal ar gyfer ni.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=753.184s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I find it more effective sometimes to talk directly to the people because you can cover the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=759.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The letter is a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=760.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: paragraph or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=761.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the things that did take place in the last week or so, which I think is encouraging, is the fact that the revenue from the state has gone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=770.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because the revenue has gone up, I'm sure a lot of the agencies were sitting there saying, I can't spend any money because I'm going to get cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=776.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't hire anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=778.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if revenue continues to be solid at the state, if we can see another bump, I suspect that maybe something like DCR might say, well, OK, I can take this chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=788.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But a lot of these agencies are concerned<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=790.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that, you know, they hire, and then all of a sudden, or they've been told not to hire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=794.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what happens is that they are in a situation where they're going to then scramble for money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=799.506s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as the fiscal situation stabilizes, the governor has pulled back in his request to start 9C cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=806.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The legislature asked him to hold back on that request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=810.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The revenue projections for this month were a lot stronger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=812.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, they're meeting their targets right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=814.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're a few dollars under, but they should expect another rush in this next little while.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=818.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's all encouraging, because that's in the background of why an agency will hire or not hire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=825.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They were in a freeze pattern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=826.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's probably part of the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=828.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So hopefully, we hit it at the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=830.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We say, look, you're stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=832.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is something that's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1250.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Chairperson, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, maiden appearance tonight of our new Director of Finance Administration, Christine Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1490.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a monthly report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1493.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, we've had a lot of transitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1495.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, uh, Christine is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1497.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: been on board for a short period of time, and there's new people at City Hall, and there's new people in other roles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1503.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the key thing for us is to get all that stuff together, but you'll have one certainly very soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1508.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're just putting it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1513.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1519.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're working on that now, but she's trying to get her feet on the ground with some of the other pieces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1537.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1539.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everything sort of rolls over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1543.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say sometime in December we'll start to see this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1545.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll do it regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=1572.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll call upon our deputy superintendent to provide this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2121.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, the college fair was held on October 26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2124.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 88 different colleges and institutions represented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2130.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The place was packed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2132.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of people participated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2134.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of work goes into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2136.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This has been going on for many, many years, and it's really critical that our young people get a good start to find out what their options are, to talk to the different representatives about financial aid, what they can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2149.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2150.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was also a presentation by Jan Hollenbeck and Charlotte Hyam with regard to special needs students who would like to go to higher education and accommodation plans and how to access those as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2165.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Alice Beth Fitzpatrick from the Voc Guidance Department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2168.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did a piece on transition to college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2171.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a lot of other pieces that go into it besides just simply the booths.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2176.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's one of the most successful nights we run because people really participate, they really learn a lot, and they come away with a better sense of what they have to do to prepare for college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2186.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: College is not cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2188.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you've got to make the right decisions, things that are going to work for you, and you've got to plan well ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2192.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think this is a great night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2194.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was another good example of people at work, and Amelia and her staff did a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2250.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know there are people other than our own students who come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2253.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2281.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we gave a previous report on this, and I just want to get you the follow up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2286.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony Vento was here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2287.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She did a great job getting this in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2290.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have the report in front of you, so you don't have to go in great detail.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2293.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it was successful in getting most of the students and most of the people who were identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2298.207s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there were only three people that did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2301.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony, come on up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2304.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something of that small number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2306.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there may be some follow ups on that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2309.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we had a good forum with parents in the auditorium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2312.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wasn't hugely attended, probably 25 people, but people asked a lot of good questions and a lot of good answers came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=2534.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, we're going to call upon our Director or Principal of the Vocational School to update us on this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3045.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3047.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, if people want to take a little quiet time and meditate, they can, you know, but we don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3052.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't ask anyone to pray.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3053.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't make this specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3058.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beginning of the school day, if a youngster wants to put his head down and do something, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ify1FyW07aQ&t=3062.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, you know, but I don't think, there's nothing formal from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1029.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, without taking any positions in the upcoming election, Medford is certainly right out front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1042.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've just elected two females to the top jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1048.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1238.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents each year<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1246.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: recognizes outstanding students in each community for which there is a superintendent who is a member of mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1253.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1255.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These awards are not given lightly, they're given to individuals who have not only accomplished academic excellence, but have done other terrific things in their school environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1265.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this evening we have two presentations, one to a member of Medford High School, and one to a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School, both seniors and both outstanding individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1276.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this time, it's my great pleasure to read you about the first one, and then we'll bring that person up, and then we'll do the second, and do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1284.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first individual is a member of the class of 2017 at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1496.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll make sure that it's presented and that individual is duly recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1831.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This report was basically a follow-up on things that we didn't cover in the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1838.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did give you a report<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1856.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You report here, you've got this last piece here which does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1871.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you can see this in this in these charts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1873.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1879.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1901.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1902.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1973.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2288.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What the state has done is they've created a high-needs category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2293.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in that category, an individual might fit in more than one activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2296.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A youngster might be a person who doesn't speak English as a first language, might be special needs, and might also be economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2304.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one person might be in three categories, multiple categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2309.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you could find that, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2313.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Different scores, different activities are skewed by the fact that an individual repeats themselves in multiple categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2319.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to break those out periodically as we go just to see exactly what's the dominant category that's driving a particular result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2327.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So high needs is sort of an accumulation or cumulative amount of all the students who fall into any one of those categories as opposed to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2336.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So 50% would be too high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2341.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to look at the latest because basically the other thing that took place is Title I, which normally defined economically disadvantaged, the rule was changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2355.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And because it was changed, the numbers came way down and it affected communities across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2360.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to speculate at this point in time, but we certainly are going to break it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2395.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, disproportionality or what they call prima facie denial in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2401.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a tendency in school districts across and almost any institution if a youngster is not doing well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2408.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: som kan spekulerar om om det är en ungdom som har en lärnings- eller språkbaserad ungdom, om det är en temporär distraktion som ungdom har, eller om det är en familjedysfunktion, eller om det är andra saker som händer i deras liv.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2419.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Så det är väldigt svårt att veta om identifikationen är 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2423.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Men vi må klart betala mycket att sikta på att ungdom som inte pratar engelsk som den första språken,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2434.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: som som som som som som som som som som som<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2504.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the gap is between the youngsters who don't necessarily fall into these subgroup categories and those youngsters who do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2512.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det är viktigt att nåta, och det kom ut i vårt sista samarbete, att Medfords uppnivån i dessa subgrupper var eller ökade statens mängder i varje av dessa kategorier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2525.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Så vad det verkligen betyder, det är om staten använder ett instrument som propertiskt analyserar den tillräcklige utvecklingen av dessa ungdomar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2533.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Är det rejält att ge ungdomar en test i engelsk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2537.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in their first year in this country not speaking English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2540.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then trying to determine whether this youngster knows enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2544.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that the assessment system really deserves a work over because it's inappropriate to ask youngsters to do things for which they are not particularly good at it at this point in their life because of their genesis, where they are at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2562.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a youngster who might be progressing at a nice level for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2566.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: his or her situation might take an extra year or two to get to that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2573.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's wrong with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2574.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The goal is to get to the achievement level as much as possible, and if it takes a little longer, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2580.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people learn faster, some people learn slower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2583.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people are more skilled in a mathematical area, some people are more skilled in a language area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2588.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we need to have a better assessment system than the vanilla that we're getting right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2595.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that's going to be a topic of discussion among superintendents, school committee members, and others as we approach our meetings coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=2603.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA, and we'll have that discussion tonight as part of it, makes some changes in NCLB, but not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3089.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me make a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3090.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of material here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3093.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be discussed in the robust way it needs to be discussed in a forum like this because, you know, there's too much involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3100.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schedule a committee of the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3102.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3102.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get in the background and then we can decide which items<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3105.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can be done in what sequence and where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3108.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we do try to do it here, we'll be back and forth for a long period of time and it's not really going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3112.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, let's schedule a committee of the whole meeting, let's look at some dates and I'll get back to you with some possible dates and we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3122.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's happening in one school, but remember, we're asking our faculty and people to do an awful lot right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3128.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're taking school brains, they're doing a million different workshops,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3132.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've also got to teach their classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3133.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to make sure that we sit down and we actually roll things out in a very very digestible way and we get everybody on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3141.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise we're just running a program and it won't work, it won't stick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3145.601s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's have a meeting, let's go over it, let's decide how we can roll things out intelligently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3151.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see which things can be integrated with other initiatives that are already going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3156.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're in a better place if we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3165.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Principals have a certain amount of autonomy to do things that respond to what they see in their buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3171.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when someone does something and it works, we're naturally interested in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3176.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But what works in one building may not work in another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3179.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just need to talk about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3180.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3191.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, principals have a certain amount of autonomy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3194.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't micromanage everything that happens every day in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3198.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We let people do some of the things that they think are appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3201.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, and when it becomes something that the whole district is interested in, then maybe we bring it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3206.154s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could be talking about every program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3208.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not every school had a mock election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3211.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not every school had another thing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3213.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schools have their own identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3215.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want them to have their own identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3217.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take a look at this as a gestalt and a committee of the whole, and I think you might have a better way to decide which things should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3308.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you've got a lot going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3311.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got another meeting, you're going to be touring Capitol Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3313.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it in a reasonable time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3315.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll get back to you with dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3316.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's make sure that we can prepare for it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3319.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We meet with CPAC, we meet with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3321.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get an agenda that's sequenced, that's coherent, and then we can move forward in a positive kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3328.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To just simply get it in just to get it in is not, I don't think, productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3336.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3373.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to talk about this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3715.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3716.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tony Vento is with us this evening, and we'll just go through some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3720.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have any specific questions, Tony is here to answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3725.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provide you with documents that have been produced and gone out to parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3730.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From the outset, we've worked closely with MassDPH, with the Medford Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3734.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate all their help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3735.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've done a great job right on the spot, helping us right away, making sure we did things the way we needed to, as well as our own medical team under Tony's direction here at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3748.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On Wednesday, October 26th, there will be a TB testing of individuals who have been identified as being in close contact with the individual who was diagnosed with TB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3760.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 194 MHS students who were identified, 5 middle school students, and 14 adult personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3768.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the 20th, in the Cowan Theater, we will have a public information night available to everyone from 7 o'clock on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3776.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to answer any questions that anyone might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3779.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Individuals may choose to have the test conducted by their own physician, and then we would ask them to provide us with the information that would indicate that it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3789.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is a finding, then there would be some follow-up antibiotic activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3796.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is no finding, it would be a second round of testing during the winter period to see if something emerged subsequent to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3806.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the original case was diagnosed, there have been no further identifications, and the DPH procedure has been followed precisely to ensure due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3816.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have letters here, but I'm happy to take any questions or have the questions referred to Tony, so that if you have any<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3824.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: gaps in your understanding of what's taken place, we can answer them this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3828.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then again, on the 20th, we encourage anyone who really has some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3832.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have not received a lot of phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3834.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did originally receive the handful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3836.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know Tony received a handful, but once they were done, it was pretty quiet, and most people were satisfied with the information they received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3846.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Tony is here and you might want to direct questions to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3905.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, there's no payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3906.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they go to health insurance, which they should have, that would cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3910.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one of those things that's covered by health insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3913.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they come through us, there's no charge whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4136.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you know, No Child Left Behind has been replaced by Every Student Succeeds Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4144.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that legislation begins in 2016-2017 as a transition year, with full implementation in 2017-2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4156.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, there are several key elements of the Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4159.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to give you enough of it so you understand it, but not so much that you, you know, get overwhelmed by it because there's an awful lot of pieces and we'll have to break it down piece at a time in order for it to really be understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4170.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA comprises nine title grants which provide funding to districts and states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4178.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Currently, there are about five or six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4181.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how we count them these days because they keep putting them together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4184.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Title IV grant represents a new funding source, which is an allocation grant for districts in the area of student support services, something that would speak to some of the discussion we had a little bit earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4195.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Districts and states are required to conform to the requirements of ESSA, so that No Child Left Behind is now giving way to ESSA and districts and states now must adopt ESSA rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4209.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA encourages state agencies to think differently about how best to support low-performing schools as the school improvement grants are no longer available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4218.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they're asking the department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4220.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to talk to us about how we could best benefit from their help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4227.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That should be a very robust discussion, especially in our conference and so on and so forth going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4233.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA minimizes Title I prescriptive school and district accountability requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4239.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No Child Left Behind had very, very specific things under Title I. ESSA wiped some of it away, but it adds some things that are interesting too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4249.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Equitable access is perhaps one of the biggest areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4252.514s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is equitable access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4254.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does it mean every school gets the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4256.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does it mean it's based on proportion of low income?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4259.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it based on proportion of high needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4262.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4263.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Equitable doesn't automatically mean things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4265.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if you have a teacher in a school who makes $80,000 a year and a teacher makes $60,000 a year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4271.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it different or is it the same thing as long as there's a teacher there who's experienced and can do the job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4276.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those things are yet to be fleshed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4278.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's problematic because naturally we hire teachers at different stages of their career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4283.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a lot of it's based on, you know, how many years they've been with us and what their degrees are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4288.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That doesn't necessarily mean they're better or worse at what they will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4292.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a shift in focus on the Title II program from highly qualified to reporting on student learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4300.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of determining just the teachers are highly qualified, the question will be, what have the students learned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4305.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have to give us some rubrics to determine that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4310.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It focuses mostly on quality access to education, access to quality education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4318.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: DESE is going to continue to collect certain data, but it doesn't mean it's going to have a particular impact on what we do or don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4328.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Inexperienced teachers will be expected to do different things, but we haven't got guidelines yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4336.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Total funding for this year has been about the same, a little bit different, with a larger shift in Title IV student support money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4344.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government has readjusted funding levels and our state will receive less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4348.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state receives less money, our district receives less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4352.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In most cases, not always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4354.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Desi does not have the FY18 budget, and they're likely not to know for quite a while as to how much money will or won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4363.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, you know, with an election year, Congress, who knows what Congress will appropriate and what they won't appropriate until the election actually takes place and we determine who chairs which committees and who's in the White House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4379.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It maintains a lot of the requirements under the 1965 Act, Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the original one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4389.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some innovative assessment encouragement that will be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4394.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The definition of supplement versus supplant has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4398.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another little thing we've got to get a good handle on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4401.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does it mean to add to something versus to shift the burden from the locality to the feds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4410.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Something that comes up all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4414.134s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful that we'll get clarity on this sooner rather than later so we can plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4418.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The problem with some of these things is we don't find out until well after we've gone through a budget and say, well, guess what, this is the new rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4426.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we'll find out more as this early part of the year progresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4430.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some new accountability requirements under ESSA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4433.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've talked about that when we had the discussion on the test scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4438.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the key points in the new system might include maintaining the annual testing requirement, retaining 95% assessment participation requirement, making sure people participate, differentiation between schools depending on what they're supposed to be doing, long-term goals from the state to measure interim progress of all students in subgroups,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4468.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: New Accountability Indicators, and they're dumping the CPI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4473.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you know what the CPI is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4474.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Cumulative Performance Index?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4477.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That has been the staple of NCLB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4479.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then it got changed to the Growth Interest, SGP, then it got changed to a couple of other things that were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4486.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the more they keep changing the rules, the tougher it is for us to follow as to what's going to be the way they're going to make determinations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4495.554s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided a PowerPoint for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4497.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should go over it at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4500.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll be studying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4501.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll be looking for more information in the upcoming weeks at the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4505.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be sharing with our colleagues as to what they think and what's going on, so that we can come back and give you real specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4512.526s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be talking to our people who are involved in the federal education agencies to find out where they see the trends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4520.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is the first rush of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4522.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4523.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't totally different, but it's different, and we need to pay attention to it so we can take maximum advantage of it, optimum advantage of it, while at the same time not losing out on any possibilities that would be helpful to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4536.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4586.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have that, and our graduation rate, by the way, went up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4590.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data you had in front of you from the last presentation was previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4595.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of that is a function of how people view what is success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4599.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if a youngster is missing one course in June and makes it up over the summer, they're not part of the four-year graduation rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4605.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's exactly what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4606.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the whole point of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4607.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can provide that information to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4610.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The trick will be getting the state and the feds to recognize that as legitimate, especially for youngsters who are challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4625.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we do is we get colleagues on school committees, colleagues in my office, principals around the state, to make that point on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4634.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's something that should come up in November when we're down with colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4639.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because that's the kind of thing that really needs to be understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4641.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There shouldn't be a rush to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4643.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There should be a steady, intelligent path to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4646.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Especially for youngsters who don't speak English as a first language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4649.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Especially for youngsters who are working with cognitive and procedural difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4655.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4656.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just truly unfair and it makes them look like they're not doing what they need to do or school systems aren't doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4661.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, it would be a shame not to give a youngster more time if they needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4666.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the kind of stuff that needs to get out there and I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4670.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is something that should be front and center in our discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4673.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the old thinking was always, well, you know, you put off these kids a little bit longer and keep managing the data to avoid youngsters being reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4684.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a question of managing data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4685.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a question of providing effective education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4688.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a question of recognizing the differences between different types of learners and supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4694.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, the average college completion rate, I said that the other night, is six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4698.953s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4700.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most kids take time to complete college.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4703.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4704.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that a percentage of youngsters should take more time in high school to complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4709.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not because they can't do it, but because they need to pace themselves differently so they can learn and take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4717.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I agree with you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4731.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's something that the whole state would benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4762.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, the reason this is on your agenda is every year I get asked around this time, how do we decide when school closes and what can we do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4772.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the main message is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4775.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should start planning now as a parent about a situation that might occur and who will help to cover your youngsters if you have to go to work, who's going to stay at home, what neighbors can work with you,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4790.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What situations can occur?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4791.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you talk to your employers, maybe coming in a little bit later on certain days to get things under control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4797.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't wait till the day it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4800.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to start thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4801.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, we don't get a final call until later because we don't know if the storm is going to hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4809.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, meteorologists do their job, but they can't be sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4813.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the storm veers off at the last second, and sometimes it veers in at the last second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4819.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4820.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes the storm doesn't seem like it's coming to us at the beginning of school, but it's going to hit at 10 o'clock in the morning and getting young people home is its own problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4829.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that we have to deal with is the fact that some youngsters have no one at home on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4835.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And getting them to school means they might need a hot meal, they have some supervision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4840.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some other things going on that we want to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4844.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, if you really feel uptight, you really feel like maybe your child shouldn't be out, it's your option to keep them home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4851.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Missing a day is not going to change the world as long as you're diligent about following up on the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4857.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to understand these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4858.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now it takes a lot to figure this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4859.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to the DPW, we talk to the police department, we talk to the fire department, we talk to our own custodial crews, we talk to the contractors who plow our schools, we talk to neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4871.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What are they doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4872.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4874.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some places are more challenging than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4876.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you live in the narrow streets of Everett and Malden, it's a lot tougher to plow those streets than it is maybe in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4883.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot tougher to do certain things and they have to make decisions a little bit earlier because they can't get their crews out as fast as our crews get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4894.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4896.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: intelligent days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4897.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to think about the days if teachers can't get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4900.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So school is open and the faculty can't make it in because they no longer all live in Medford or one community over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4908.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People live in wider areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4910.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So to have a day where the faculty is missing doesn't give us a quality education day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4916.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We started earlier this year, so that should help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4919.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In terms of days, but you never know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4922.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had years where there's been no school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4925.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had years when a couple of years ago there were seven or eight school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4928.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And last year there were three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4930.166s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's hard to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4931.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one year we shut down schools when the buildings were too cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4935.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it wasn't a question of snow, it just was too cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4938.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4940.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to be up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4941.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's always somebody who tells me we shouldn't have done it, and there's somebody who always tells me we should have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4946.063s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I guarantee you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4946.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, the funniest things are the calls from the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4949.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hello, this is a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4950.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think kids should be going to school today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4954.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hello, I had to shovel all day yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4956.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I need at least one day to play in this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4959.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's really funny what the kids will call up and say and do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4964.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4965.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4966.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4967.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4968.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a little bit of planning right now would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5074.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one thing we should also mention is our young people, we've tried to encourage them, especially the older children, to help out with neighbors who may be elderly or infirmed, because obviously sidewalks and things of that type need to be shoveled so that youngsters don't have to walk in streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5090.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have situations where it's unsafe when a little kid is behind a huge snowbank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5097.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are things we need to talk a little bit about to the community about how they can help us make sure that if there's an accumulation of snow, it doesn't block the visibility for youngsters near buses or in their cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5258.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, the one thing I want to stress with this particular motion, while the motion itself is good, the adequacy word is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5267.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they only put a certain amount of money, and even if it's more money, and it gets distributed in ways that Medford doesn't get any money, it doesn't help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5278.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's important that they increase the foundation budget, but it's also important that they understand that adequacy means that every community has to receive more than it's currently receiving now, not just those communities that fall below foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5294.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's critical, you know, that we stress when we talk at the conference about adequacy being funding everyone because everyone can use the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5303.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there's that John Greenleaf Whittier quote that I love so much, but I modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5309.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John Greenleaf Whittier said, of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are what might have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5314.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I changed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5315.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5320.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because when they don't appropriate enough money, the language doesn't mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5324.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got to understand that communities like Medford may be wealthier than certain other communities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5331.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not as wealthy as others, but we need money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5334.611s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't have a Foundation Budget Review Committee that wipes out additional funding to 150 communities, which is what the Foundation Budget Review Committee distribution would have done, including Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5348.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should vote yes, but we should vote for adequacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5350.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should push adequacy in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5366.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, basically, we should be saying that all communities should receive an increase<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5373.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that is consistent with the demands and the mandates that the state has put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5378.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state has increased the number of mandates to communities, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5381.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unfunded mandates is almost a way of life at the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5386.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We cannot continue to allow that to happen because we continue to use our own money for things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5393.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then as a result,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5394.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Eventually, we have to cut other things that we don't want to cut, or you can't go where you want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5399.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So remember this year when we talked budget, I told you that we got $55 per pupil minimum aid, new money in the Chapter 70, which is more than a 25 of the year before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5409.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the net net was we lost $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5410.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not a win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5415.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What that is is a partial win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5418.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a balancing act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5422.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to make sure that if they're going to increase the foundation budget, that it adequately reflects the needs of all communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5429.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the message to the MASC Resolutions Committee and to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5453.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we received all the scheduled receipts and first quarter payments from Commonwealth?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5456.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh-huh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5457.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5457.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd be curious to see what October's receipts look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5460.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: September look better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5463.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5510.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think we should put that into our language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5515.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That adequacy, that we should stress adequacy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5517.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and a full distribution to all communities under Chapter 70, not just some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5526.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, amending it, adding another, adding an emphasis point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5540.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's important to note that if you expect the legislature to enact something,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5544.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have 150 cities and towns that aren't going to benefit, it's unlikely they're going to enact it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5549.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the likelihood of it being enacted has a greater chance if every community is a winner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6025.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 330 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6025.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 330 spread amongst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6039.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A few years ago, we did a study along with MASS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6043.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We found that we could fund those youngsters by putting them in classrooms at this point in time, back then, at about a third of the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6052.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, when people say that there is no loss of revenue<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6057.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't do the numbers like we do the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6061.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some communities that don't have space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6063.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some situations that don't exist, that don't work 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6067.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this community, it will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6290.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so on the School Brains activity, as you know, we've switched from iPass to School Brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6295.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a much more comprehensive and much more, let's say, modernized version of school software that would keep track of students, staff, and other records and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6306.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there was a rollout period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6308.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the primary activity initially was, one, to transfer information from iPass to School Brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6315.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's still some data that has to be cleaned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6318.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very arduous process because some of the material is in different formats from one to the other and has to be individually looked at to be sure of accuracy as people come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6329.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's not static.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6330.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's true today may not be true tomorrow as people come and leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6334.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, there needs to be training on this and there is training going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6340.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a train-the-trainer activity at the schools, where we're empowering certain teachers and administrators to become lead people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6349.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on the school professional development day, we're having an all-school activity that will deal with that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6356.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our primary activity initially is to roll out the attendance and grade reporting activities, because that's what's essential for us to do what has to be done, and also the materials that are associated with state reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6369.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will then work on the parent portal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6371.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school and the vocational school will be ready at the end of the first quarter, around November 17th, to open up the parent portal for students at those schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6381.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think the middle schools probably have a good shot to be opened by the first of the year, and the elementary schools are working on their standards report cards, and we'll get a better handle on that once that's been cleaned up, and we know exactly when they can be able to comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6395.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's making progress, we want to do it right,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6400.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is something called a System Interoperational Framework, SIF, that is important to coordinate with the state, because if you will, garbage in, garbage out, and once you get that kind of thing happening, it becomes impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6413.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just simply by inverting the first name and the last name in some reports can create all kinds of errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6420.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Very careful as we convert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6422.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the long run, it will be distinctly to our advantage that it may take a little bit longer, but our goal remains the same, to increase our interactivity with parents and to provide people with full information and to be able to create reports that will help us all better understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6437.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6439.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some places, it'll be a little bit slower than others, but we're working on it, and we're certainly not stopping what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6446.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the school bus, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6475.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, I don't want to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6477.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm foolish enough to say something that I can't deliver on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6480.245s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that we want to be careful about is we make a promise and we can't keep it, we're worse off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6485.71s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I told you that the high school will be ready at the end of the first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6488.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think the middle school will be ready by the first of the year, if not sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6492.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We elementary schools will roll out a little bit differently because they have different informational reporting things than the standards report cards and the other two frameworks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6501.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to be a little bit careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6503.136s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's just put it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6504.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are diligently proceeding of a better idea after the training is done in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6510.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, to see what teachers' minds are, what they feel comfortable with, and we can work our way through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6516.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I understand that people are anxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6518.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, I certainly don't want to make promises I can't keep because that only creates more problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6573.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MBTA bus passes, the MBTA changed the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6577.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MBTA gave what they called an M-pass and an S-pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6580.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The M-pass is a pass that allows you to bypass for 30 days, for a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6585.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's $30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6586.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that gives you unlimited riding privileges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6589.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The S-Pass was a pass that you could put $10 on and you could use up to $10 for a time and then get another pass, get it renewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6598.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty is that the S-Pass was being abused widely and the MBTA pulled it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6604.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they said school systems and communities are now responsible if the wrong people use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6610.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what we had people losing it, people letting their cousins and their relatives use it, and there was all kinds of problems associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6618.004s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, we recognize that it's something that we want to be available to people, but we want to do it in a measured way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6625.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I've given you a report tonight to show that we've checked it out, we're following it, we're going to do it a limited amount of the time, especially for those people who clearly have a need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6635.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to have it, but at the same token, we want to be very careful that we don't have abuse and we don't have lost passes and things like that because then we'll get charged for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6645.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6646.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just a Medford issue, it's across the state, across the, let's say, the MBTA area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6651.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is an MBTA-driven activity and we want to control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6656.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plus the fact, too, it's a lot of man hours, person hours, if you will, to control these passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6662.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People come in, I've lost my pass, can I have another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6666.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot of work associated with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6668.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to create a certain sense that this is something you need to protect and you need to use it wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6674.574s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if someone doesn't use it appropriately, they won't get it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6773.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, well, what I told you before, basically, we did a lot of training last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6777.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had to negotiate a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6779.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did negotiate the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6781.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then we had to work in training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6783.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Teachers were uncomfortable using some of these things and took time to get them going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6786.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did run training last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6788.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't consider it to be sufficient enough and they wanted to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6791.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the summer, people were away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6793.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can only do so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6795.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can only do what the people that want to come in and want to work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6799.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other things that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6801.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6804.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The goal was to do it right and to have it be a long-term value to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6809.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to rush it and create a situation where we promise you things and then we can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6814.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as a little inconvenience in the front end, I understand that, but better to have that little inconvenience in the front end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6820.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can certainly communicate with your teachers by email, you can certainly call up the school, you certainly can visit to get any information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6826.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're certainly still sending out progress reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6829.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not something we've stopped doing, but the electronic system is going to take a little bit longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6835.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school will happen very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6837.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Middle school I think will follow pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6839.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the elementary schools will have to figure out what's the best way to do that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6845.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone is trying to slow it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6849.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it takes time to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6851.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we rush it and we do something, we're gonna probably find we'll have more headaches down the road than we really bargained for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6858.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Garbage in, garbage out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6859.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6861.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6862.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully people understand that we're doing everything we can to get it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6866.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In a short period of time, it'll happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6933.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Joanne Mortel is the person on the point of this particular bus pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6938.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's in the accounts payable office of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6941.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can look it up from the business offices to the phone number I have in front of me right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6946.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's the person issuing them and paying attention to their monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6950.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot of work and I appreciate all the work that Joanne has done to keep things in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7323.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's been moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7324.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's been moved up to the Science Lab and with appropriate arrangements so that the youngsters can come and go freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7332.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just might also announce, if I can, Madam Mayor, that tomorrow at noontime, the Medford High School Band will be playing at the Science Museum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7342.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for a special announcement from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7347.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Medford resident, who I believe will be making a major presentation to the Science Museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=716.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Without taking any positions in the upcoming election, Medford is certainly right out front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=722.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've just elected two females to the top jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=728.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're ahead of the curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=919.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents each year recognizes outstanding students in each community for which there is a superintendent who is a member of Mass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=936.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These awards are not given lightly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=938.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're given to individuals who have not only accomplished academic excellence, but have done other terrific things in their school environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=945.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this evening, we have two presentations, one to a member of Medford High School and one to a member of the Medford Vocational Technical High School, both seniors and both outstanding individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=956.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this time, it's my great pleasure to read you about the first one, and then we'll bring that person up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=961.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll do the second and do the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=964.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first individual is a member of the class of 2017 at Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=969.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He is a consistent honor roll student with a GPA of 4.07.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1017.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In addition to his sports and clubs, Zachary works at the Medford High School pool as a lifeguard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1023.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ladies and gentlemen, it's my distinct pleasure to call up for your recognition, Zachary Mafio.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1029.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Zachary, where are you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1040.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Congratulations, Zach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1041.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1047.478s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1107.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our next award winner is from the Medford Vocational Technical High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1111.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This individual is a senior in the construction craft laborers and is ranked number two in the senior class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1118.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A hard worker and always eager to learn, she has spent the last three years learning many skills in the construction and carpentry field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1126.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year she was a medal winner in masonry at the Regional Skills USA competition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1132.681s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She spent the summer working with a general contractor and recently was hired at Cleveland Fence Company in Stonehenge, Massachusetts, where she will work in a cooperative education job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1144.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Her teachers report that during his time at MHS, he had been a consistent and committed student and a great asset to the Construction Craft Laborers Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1154.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Long-term goal is to become a general contractor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1157.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Immediate goals are to join and work for construction or carpentry union while pursuing a degree in construction management.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1163.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's our pleasure to introduce Valerie Seju.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1176.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1177.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll make sure that it's presented and that, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1181.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: individuals duly recognized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1512.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This, uh, report, uh,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1514.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: was basically a follow-up on things that we didn't cover in the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1518.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did give you a report earlier on state assessment results and accountability ratings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1524.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that included a lot of the high school 10th grade MCAS scores and comparisons with the state, because that's the only place where the state had any comparative data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1533.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't do anything in the other areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1535.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's in the back of your report here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1537.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got this last piece here, which does that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1552.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you can see this in this, in these charts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1554.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's where that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1560.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1582.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1583.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on that now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1586.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1967.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1968.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What the state has done,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1971.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is they've created a high needs category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1973.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And in that category, an individual might fit in more than one activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1977.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A youngster might be a person who doesn't speak English as a first language, might be special needs, and might also be economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1985.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one person might be in three categories, multiple categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1990.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you could find that different scores, different activities are skewed by the fact that an individual repeats themselves in multiple categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=1999.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to break those out periodically as we go, just to see exactly what's the dominant category that's driving a particular result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2007.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So high needs is sort of an accumulation or cumulative amount of all the students who fall into any one of those categories, as opposed to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2016.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So 50% would be too high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2022.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I want to look at the latest, because basically, the other thing that took place is Title I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2028.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, which normally defined, um, economically disadvantaged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2034.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rule was changed and because it was changed, the numbers came way down and it affected communities across the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2041.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't want to speculate at this point in time, but I, we certainly are going to break it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2076.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, disproportionality or what they call prima facie denial in some instances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2084.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: tendency in school districts or across almost any institution if a youngster is not doing well to speculate as to whether that youngster has a learning disability, whether it's language-based, whether it's a temporary distraction that the youngster is going through, maybe some family dysfunction, some other things going on in their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2101.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's really hard to know whether the identification is really 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2108.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, we have to pay a lot of attention to making sure that a youngster, let's say, who doesn't speak English as a first language<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2114.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: isn't automatically included as a special needs student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2116.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2117.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or a youngster as a special needs student isn't automatically assumed to be of a particular category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2123.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may very well be that it's a standalone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2126.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's going to be done very, very carefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2128.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's going to be done case by case, school by school, so that we really know who's where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2185.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the gap is between the youngsters who don't necessarily fall into these subgroup categories and those youngsters who do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2192.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's important to note, and this was brought out at our last meeting,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2197.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that Medford's achievement levels in these subgroups either met or exceeded the state average in each of these categories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2205.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what it really means is, is the state using an instrument that properly assesses the appropriate development of these youngsters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2214.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it fair to give a youngster a test in English<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2218.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in their first year in this country not speaking English and then trying to determine whether this youngster knows enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2225.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that the assessment system really deserves a work over because it's inappropriate to ask youngsters to do things for which they are not particularly good at it at this point in their life because of their genesis, where they are at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2243.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a youngster who might be progressing at a nice level for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2247.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: his or her situation might take an extra year or two to get to that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2253.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's wrong with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2254.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The goal is to get to the achievement level as much as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2259.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it takes a little longer, fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2261.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people learn faster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2262.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people learn slower.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2264.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people are more skilled in a mathematical area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2266.804s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people are more skilled in a language area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2268.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we need to have a better assessment system than the vanilla that we're getting right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2276.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's going to be a topic of discussion among superintendents, school committee members, and others as we approach our meetings coming forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2283.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA, and we'll have that discussion tonight as part of it, makes some changes in NCLB, but not enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2769.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me make a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2771.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of material here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2773.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It can't be discussed in the robust way it needs to be discussed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2777.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: forum like this because, you know, there's too much involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2780.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schedule a committee, the whole meeting, let's get to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2783.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get in the background and then we can decide which items can be done in what sequence and where.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2788.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we do try to do it here, we'll be back and forth for a long period of time and it's not really going to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2793.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's schedule a committee, the whole meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2795.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's look at some dates and I'll get back to you with some possible dates and we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2803.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, it's happening in one school, but remember,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2805.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're asking our faculty and people to do an awful lot right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2808.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're taking school brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2810.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're doing a million different workshops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2812.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've also got to teach their classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2814.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to make sure that we sit down and we actually roll things out in a very, very digestible way, and we get everybody on board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2822.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Otherwise, we're just running a program, and it won't work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2825.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It won't stick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2826.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's have a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2827.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's go over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2828.806s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's decide how we can roll things out intelligently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2831.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let's see which things can be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2833.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: let's say integrated with other initiatives that are already going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2836.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think we're in a better place if we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2846.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Principals have a certain amount of autonomy to do things that respond to what they see in their buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2852.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But when someone does something and it works, we're naturally interested in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2856.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But what works in one building may not work in another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2859.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and we just need to talk about it, that's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2872.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, principals have a certain amount of autonomy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2874.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't micromanage everything that happens every day in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2878.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We let people do some of the things that they think are appropriate, you know, and when it becomes something that the whole district is interested in, then maybe we bring it here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2886.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could be talking about every program,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2888.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not every school had a mock election.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2891.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not every school had another thing going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2894.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Schools have their own identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2895.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want them to have their own identities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2897.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's take a look at this as a gestalt and a committee of the whole, and I think you might have a better way to decide which things should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2989.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you've got a lot going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2991.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got another meeting, you're going to be touring capital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2994.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it in a reasonable time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2995.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll get back to you with dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=2997.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's make sure that we can prepare for it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3000.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We meet with CPAC, we meet with others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3001.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get an agenda that's sequenced, that's coherent, and then we can move forward in a positive kind of way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3009.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To just simply get it in just to get it in is not, I don't think, productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3054.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on our assistant superintendent superintendent Diane Caldwell to talk about this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3395.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3396.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Members of the committee, Tony Vento is with us this evening, and we'll just go through some of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3401.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have any specific questions, Tony is here to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3405.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provide you with documents that have been produced and gone out to parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3410.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From the outset, we've worked closely with MassDBH, with the Medford Board of Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3415.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We appreciate all their help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3416.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've done a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3418.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: right on the spot, helping us right away, making sure we did things the way we needed to, as well as our own medical team under Tony's direction here at the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3428.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On Wednesday, October 26th, there will be a TB testing of individuals who have been identified as being in close contact with the individual who was diagnosed with TB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3441.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 194 MHS students who were identified, five middle school students, and 14 adult personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3448.977s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the 20th, in the Cowan Theater, we will have a public information night available to everyone from 7 o'clock on to answer any questions that anyone might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3459.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Individuals may choose to have the test conducted by their own physician, and then we would ask them to provide us with the information that would indicate that it was done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3469.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is a finding, then there would be some follow-up antibiotic activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3476.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there is no finding, it would be a second round of testing during the winter period to see if something emerged subsequent to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3487.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since the original case was diagnosed, there have been no further identifications, and the DPH procedure has been followed precisely to ensure due diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3495.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have letters here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3498.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I'm happy to take any questions or have the questions referred to Tony so that if you have any gaps in your understanding of what's taken place, we can answer them this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3509.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then again, on the 20th, we encourage anyone who really has some questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3512.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I have not received a lot of phone calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3515.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I did originally receive the handful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3517.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know Tony received a handful, but once they were done, it pretty much was pretty quiet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3523.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And most people were satisfied with the information they received.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3526.851s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Tony is here, and you might want to direct questions to him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3585.691s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, there's no payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3586.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they go to health insurance, which they should have, that would cover it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3591.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's one of those things that's covered by health insurance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3593.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they come through us, there's no charge whatsoever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3816.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you know, No Child Left Behind has been replaced by Every Student Succeeds Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3825.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that legislation begins in 2016-2017 as a transition year with full implementation in 2017-2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3837.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now there are several key elements of the act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3839.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to give you enough of it so you understand it, but not so much that you get overwhelmed by it because there's an awful lot of pieces and we'll have to break it down a piece at a time in order for it to really be understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3851.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA comprises nine title grants which provide funding to districts and states.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3859.381s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Currently there are about five or six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3861.762s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure how we count them these days because they keep putting them together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3865.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Title IV grant represents a new funding source, which is an allocation grant for districts in the area of student support services, something that would speak to some of the discussion we had a little bit earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3876.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Districts and states are required to conform to the requirements of ESSA, so that No Child Left Behind is now giving way to ESSA, and districts and states now must adopt ESSA rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3890.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA encourages state agencies to think differently about how best to support low-performing schools as the school improvement grants are no longer available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3899.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they're asking the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to talk to us about how we could best benefit from their help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3908.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That should be a very robust discussion, especially in our conference and so on and so forth going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3914.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ESSA minimizes Title I prescriptive school and district accountability requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3919.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No Child Left Behind had very, very specific things under Title I. The SSA wiped some of it away, but it adds some things that are interesting, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3930.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Equitable access is perhaps one of the biggest areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3933.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is equitable access?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3934.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does it mean every school gets the same thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3937.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Does it mean it's based on proportion of low income?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3940.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it based on proportion of high needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3942.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3944.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Equitable doesn't automatically mean things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3945.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What if you have a teacher in a school who<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3948.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: $80,000 a year and a teacher makes $60,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3952.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it different or is it the same thing as long as there's a teacher there who's experienced and can do the job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3956.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those things are yet to be fleshed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3959.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's problematic because, naturally, we hire teachers at different stages of their career.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3963.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a lot of it's based on how many years they've been with us and what their degrees are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3968.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That doesn't necessarily mean they're better or worse at what they will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3972.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a shift in focus on the Title II program from highly qualified to reporting on student<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3978.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: learning experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3980.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So instead of determining just the teachers are highly qualified, the question will be, what have the students learned?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3986.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they have to give us some rubrics to determine that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3991.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It focuses mostly on quality access to education, access to quality education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=3999.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: DESE is going to continue to collect certain data, but it doesn't mean it's going to have a particular impact on what we do or don't do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4008.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Inexperienced teachers will be expected to do different things, but we haven't got guidelines yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4016.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Total funding for this year has been about the same, a little bit different, with a larger shift in Title IV student support money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4024.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The federal government has readjusted funding levels and our state will receive less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4029.355s">[Roy Belson]</a>: State receives less money, our district receives less money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4033.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In most cases, not always.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4035.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: DESE does not have the FY18 budget, and they're likely not to know for quite a while as to how much money will or won't be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4044.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, you know, with an election year, Congress, who knows what Congress will appropriate and what they won't appropriate until the election actually takes place and we determine who chairs which committees and who's in the White House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4060.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It maintains a lot of the requirements under the 1965 Act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4065.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, the original one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4068.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some innovative assessment encouragement that will be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4075.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The definition of supplement versus supplant has changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4079.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's another little thing we've got to get a good handle on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4082.48s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does it mean to add to something versus to shift the burden from the locality to the feds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4090.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's something that comes up all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4094.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hopeful that, you know, we'll get clarity on this sooner rather than later so we can plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4100.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Problem with some of these things is we don't find out until well after we've gone through budget and says, well, guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4105.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the new rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4107.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we'll find out more as this early part of the year progresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4111.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some new accountability requirements on the ESSA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4114.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've talked about that when we had the discussion on the test scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4119.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the key points in the new system might include<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4122.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: maintaining the annual testing requirement, retaining 95% assessment participation requirement, making sure people participate, differentiation between schools, depending on what they're supposed to be doing, long-term goals from the state to measure interim progress of all students in subgroups, new accountability indicators, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4152.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're dumping the CPI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4154.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know what the CPI is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4155.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Cumulative Performance Index?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4157.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That has been the staple of NCLB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4160.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then it got changed to the Growth Interest, SGP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4163.321s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then it got changed to a couple of other things that were going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4166.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the more they keep changing the rules, the tougher it is for us to follow as to what's going to be the way they're going to make determinations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4176.17s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided a PowerPoint for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4178.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should go over it at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4180.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll be studying it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4181.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll be looking for more information in the upcoming weeks at the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4185.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll be sharing with our colleagues as to what they think and what's going on so that we can come back and give you real specifics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4193.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll be talking to our people who are involved in the federal education agencies to find out where they see the trends are going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4200.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is the first rush of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4203.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4204.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't totally different, but it's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4206.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to pay attention to it so we can take maximum advantage of it, optimum advantage of it, while at the same time not losing out on any possibilities that would be helpful to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4216.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4267.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have that, and our graduation rate, by the way, went up this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4271.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The data you had in front of you from the last presentation was previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4275.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Part of that, you know, is a function of how people view what is success.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4280.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if a youngster is missing one course in June and makes it up over the summer, they're not part of the four-year graduation rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4286.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4287.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the whole point of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4288.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can provide that information to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4290.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The trick will be getting the state and the feds to recognize that as legitimate, especially for youngsters who are challenged.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4306.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we do is we get colleagues on school committees, colleagues in my office, principals around the state, to make that point on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4315.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's something that should come up in November when we're down with colleagues, because that's the kind of thing that really needs to be understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4322.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There shouldn't be a rush to succeed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4324.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There should be a steady, intelligent path to succeed, especially for youngsters who don't speak English as a first language, especially for youngsters who are working with cognitive<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4333.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and procedural difficulties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4335.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4337.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just truly unfair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4338.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it makes them look like they're not doing what they need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4340.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our school systems aren't doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4342.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, it would be a shame not to give a youngster more time if they needed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4347.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the kind of stuff that needs to get out there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4349.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I agree with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4350.909s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is something that should be front and center in our discussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4354.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the old thinking was always, well, you know, you put off these kids a little bit longer and keep managing the data to avoid youngsters being reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4364.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not a question of managing data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4366.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a question of providing effective education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4368.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a question of recognizing the differences between different types of learners and supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4374.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, the average college completion rate, I said that the other night, is six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4379.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Six years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4381.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Most kids take time to complete college, and it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4384.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: unlikely that a percentage of youngsters should take more time in high school to complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4390.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not because they can't do it, but because they need to pace themselves differently so they can learn and take advantage of the opportunities that are in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4398.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I agree with you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4411.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's something that the whole state would benefit from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4443.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the reason this is on your agenda is every year I get asked around this time, how do we decide when school closes and what can we do about it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4452.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the main message is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4456.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should start planning now as a parent about a situation that might occur and who will help to cover your youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4464.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you have to go to work, who's going to stay at home, what neighbors can work with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4470.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What situations can occur?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4472.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you talk to your employers who may be coming in a little bit later on certain days to get things under control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4478.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't wait until the day it happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4480.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to start thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4482.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And oftentimes, we don't get<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4485.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a final call until later, because we don't know if the storm is going to hit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4490.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, meteorologists do their job, but they can't be sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4494.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes the storm veers off at the last second, and sometimes it veers in at the last second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4499.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to be careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4500.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes the storm doesn't seem like it's coming to us at the beginning of school, but it's going to hit at 10 o'clock in the morning, and getting young people home is its own problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4509.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing that we have to deal with is the fact that some youngsters have no one at home on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4515.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And getting them to school means they might get to eat a hot meal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4519.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have some supervision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4521.529s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's some other things going on that we want to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4525.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, if you really feel uptight and you really feel like maybe your child shouldn't be out, it's your option to keep them home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4532.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Missing a day is not going to change the world as long as you're diligent about following up on the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4537.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to understand these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4539.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, it takes a lot to figure this out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4540.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to the DPW.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4542.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to the police department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4544.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to the fire department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4545.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to our own custodial crews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4548.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to the contractors who plow our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4550.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talk to neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4552.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What are they doing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4553.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How are they doing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4555.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some places are more challenging than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4557.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you live in the narrow streets of Everett and Malden, it's a lot tougher to plow those streets than it is maybe in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4564.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot tougher to do certain things<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4566.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and they have to make decisions a little bit earlier because they can't get their crews out as fast as our crews get out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4575.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to provide intelligent days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4578.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also have to think about the days if teachers can't get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4581.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So school is open and the faculty can't make it in because they no longer all live in Medford or one community over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4589.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People live in wider areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4591.406s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So to have a day where the faculty is missing doesn't give us a quality education day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4596.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We started earlier this year, so that should help in terms of days, but you never know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4603.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had years where there's been no school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4605.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had years when a couple years ago there was seven or eight school days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4609.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And last year there were three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4610.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's hard to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4611.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one year we shut down schools when the buildings were too cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4615.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it wasn't a question of snow, it just was too cold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4618.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4620.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we try to be upfront.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4622.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's always somebody who tells me we shouldn't have done it, and there's somebody who always tells me we should have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4626.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I guarantee you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4627.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, the funniest things are the calls from the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4630.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hello, this is a parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4631.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think kids should be going to school today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4633.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hello, I had to shovel all day yesterday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4637.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I need at least one day to play in this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4639.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, it's really funny what the kids will call up and say and do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4645.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you understand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4647.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's what it is, OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4648.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a little bit of planning right now would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4748.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4754.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a one thing we should also mention is our young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4757.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've tried to encourage them, especially the older children to help out with neighbors who may be elderly or infirmed because obviously sidewalks and things of that type need to be shoveled so that youngsters don't have to walk in streets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4770.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, and we don't have situations where it's unsafe when a little kid is behind a huge snowbank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4778.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are things we need to talk a little bit about to the community about how they can help us make sure that if there's an accumulation of snow, it doesn't block the visibility for youngsters near buses or near cars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4939.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, the one thing I want to stress with this particular motion, while the motion itself is good, the adequacy word is very important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4948.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because if they only put a certain amount of money, and even if it's more money,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4952.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and it gets distributed in ways that Medford doesn't get any money, it doesn't help us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4958.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that they increase the foundation budget, but it's also important that they understand that adequacy means that every community has to receive more than it's currently receiving now, not just those communities that fall below foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4975.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's critical, you know, that we stress when we talk at the conference about adequacy being<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4980.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: funding everyone, because everyone can use the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4984.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there's that John Greenleaf Whittier quote that I love so much, but I modify it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4990.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John Greenleaf Whittier said, of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are what might have been.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4995.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I changed that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=4995.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of all the sad words of tongue and pen, the saddest of these are subject to appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5000.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because when they don't appropriate enough money, the language doesn't mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5005.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've got to understand that communities like Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5009.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: may be wealthier than certain other communities, not as wealthy as others, but we need money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5015.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't have a Foundation Budget Review Committee that wipes out additional funding to 150 communities, which is what the Foundation Budget Review Committee distribution would have done, including Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5029.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should vote yes, but we should vote for adequacy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5031.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should push adequacy in our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5049.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, basically we should be saying that all communities should receive an increase that is consistent with the demands and the mandates that the state has put in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5059.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state has increased the number of mandates to communities, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5062.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unfunded mandates is almost a way of life at the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5066.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We cannot continue to allow that to happen because we continue to use our own money for things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5073.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then as a result, eventually we have to cut other things that we don't want to cut or you can't go where you want to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5079.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So remember this year when we talked budget, I told you that we got $55 per pupil minimum aid, new money on the chapter 70, which was more than a 25 of the year before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5089.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the net net was we lost $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5094.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not a win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5095.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What that is is a partial win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5100.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a balancing act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5103.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to make sure that if they're going to increase the foundation budget, that it adequately reflects the needs of all communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5110.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the message to the MASC Resolutions Committee and to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5138.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5138.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd be curious to see what October's receipts look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5141.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: September look better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5143.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but not great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5190.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I think, I think we should put that into our, into our language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5194.641s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that adequacy that we should stress adequacy and you know, and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5199.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a full distribution to all communities, you know, under chapter 70, not just some.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5204.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So amending, amending this, amending it, amending it, adding another, adding an emphasis point, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5220.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's important to note that if you expect the legislature to enact something, if you have 150 cities and towns that aren't going to benefit,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5228.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: it's unlikely they're going to enact it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5230.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the likelihood of it being enacted has a greater chance if every community is a winner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5705.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 330 right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5706.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 330 spread amongst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5719.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a few years ago we did a study along with MASS and we found that we could fund those youngsters by putting them in classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5728.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, at this point in time back then at about a third of the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5733.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when people say that there is no loss of revenue,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5738.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't do the numbers like we do the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5742.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some communities that don't have space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5744.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be some situations that don't exist, that don't work 100%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5747.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this community, it will work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5971.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so on the School Brains activity, as you know, we've switched from iPass to School Brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5976.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a much more comprehensive and much more, let's say, modernized version of school software that would keep track of students, staff, and other records and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5987.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there was a rollout period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5989.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the primary activity initially was, one, to transfer information from iPass to School Brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5996.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's still some data that has to be cleaned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=5998.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a very arduous process because some of the material is in different formats from one to the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6004.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It has to be individually looked at to be sure of accuracy as people come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6009.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's not static.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6010.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What's true today may not be true tomorrow as people come and leave.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6015.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, there needs to be training on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6018.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there is training going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6019.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, tomorrow, there is a train-the-trainer activity at the schools where we're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6025.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: empowering certain teachers and administrators to become lead people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6029.814s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And on the school, uh, professional development day, we're having an all school activity that will, we'll deal with that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6036.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our primary activity initially is to roll out the attendance and grade reporting activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6042.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Cause that's, what's essential for us to, to do what has to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6045.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also the materials that are associated with, with state reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6049.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, we will then work on the parent portal, the high school and the vocational school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6054.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, as we'll be ready at the end of the first quarter around November 17th to open up the parent portal for students at those schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6062.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, we think the middle schools probably have a good shot to be opened by the first of the year and the elementary schools are working on their standards report cards and we get a better handle on that once that's been cleaned up and we know exactly when they can be able to comment on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6076.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's making progress.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6078.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6079.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6080.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is something called a System Interoperational Framework, SIF, that is important to coordinate with the state, because if you will, garbage in, garbage out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6091.103s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And once you get that kind of thing happening, it becomes impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6094.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just simply by inverting the first name and the last name in some reports can create all kinds of errors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6100.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to be very careful as we convert.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6103.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the long run, it'll be distinctly to our advantage that it may take a little bit longer, but our goal remains the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6109.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to increase our interactivity with parents, and to provide people with full information, and to be able to create reports that will help us all better understand what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6117.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's that particular activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6120.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some places it'll be a little bit slower than others, but we're working on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6124.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're certainly not stopping what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6127.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the school bus, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6156.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, I don't want to be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6157.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: foolish enough to say something that I can't deliver on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6160.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And one of the things that we want to be careful about is we make a promise and we can't keep it, we're worse off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6166.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I told you that the high school will be ready at the end of the first quarter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6169.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think the middle school will be ready by the first of the year, if not sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6172.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the elementary schools will roll out a little bit differently because they have different informational reporting things than the standards report cards than the other two frameworks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6181.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to be a little bit careful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6183.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's just put it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6184.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are diligently proceeding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6186.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll have a better idea after the training is done in November.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6191.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, to see what teachers' minds are, what they feel comfortable with, and we can work our way through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6197.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I understand that people are anxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6199.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, I certainly don't want to make promises I can't keep, because that only creates more problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6250.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, the MBTA bus passes, uh, the MBTA changed the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6257.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The MBTA gave what they called an M pass and an S pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6261.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The M pass is a pass that allows you to buy a pass for 30 days for a month and it's $30 and that gives you unlimited writing privileges.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6270.227s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The S-pass was a pass that you could put $10 on and you could use up to $10 for a time and then get another pass, get it renewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6278.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The difficulty is that the S-pass was being abused widely and the MBTA pulled it in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6285.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they said, school systems and communities are now responsible if the wrong people use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6290.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And what we had people losing it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6293.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: letting their cousins and their relatives use it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6296.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was all kinds of problems associated with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6298.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we recognize that it's a, it's something that we want to be available to people, but we want to do it in a measured way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6306.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've given you a report tonight to show that we've checked it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6309.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're following it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6310.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to do it a limited amount of the time, especially for those people who clearly have a need to have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6316.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at the same token,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6318.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to be very careful that we don't have abuse and we don't have lost passes and things like that because then we'll get charged for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6325.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6326.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not just a Medford issue, it's across the state, across the, let's say the MBTA area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6332.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is an MBTA driven activity and we want to control it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6337.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Plus the fact too, it's a lot of man hours, person hours if you will, to control these passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6343.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People come in, I've lost my pass, can I have another one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6347.231s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a lot of work associated with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6348.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to create a certain sense that this is something you need to protect and you need to use it wisely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6355.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if someone doesn't use it appropriately, they won't get it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6454.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6454.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, what I told you before, basically we did a lot of training last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6458.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had to negotiate a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6460.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did negotiate the contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6461.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then we had to work in training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6463.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Teachers were uncomfortable using some of these things, and it took time to get them going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6467.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did run training last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6469.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't consider it to be sufficient enough, and they wanted to do more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6472.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the summer, people are away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6474.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can only do so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6476.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can only do what the people that want to come in and want to work on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6480.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are other things that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6482.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6485.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the goal was to do it right and to have it be a long-term value to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6490.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to rush it and create a situation where we promise you things and then we can't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6494.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as far as a little inconvenience in the front end, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6498.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But better to have that little inconvenience in the front end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6501.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can certainly communicate with your teachers by email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6503.239s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can certainly call up the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6504.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You certainly can visit to get any information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6507.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're certainly still sending out progress reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6510.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not something we've stopped doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6513.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The electronic system is going to take a little bit longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6516.0s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The high school will happen very shortly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6518.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Middle school, I think, will follow pretty quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6520.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the elementary schools will have to figure out what's the best way to do that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6526.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think anyone is trying to slow it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6529.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just think it takes time to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6532.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we rush it and we do something, we're going to probably find we'll have more headaches down the road than we really bargained for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6538.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Garbage in, garbage out, we don't want that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6541.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6543.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully people understand that we're doing everything we can to get it going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6547.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In a short period of time, it'll happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6613.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Joanne Mortel is the person on the point of this particular bus pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6618.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's in the accounts payable office of the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6621.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can look it up from the business offices to the phone number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6624.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have it in front of me right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6626.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He's a person issuing them and paying attention to their monitoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=6630.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a lot of work and I appreciate all the work that Joanne has done to keep things in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7003.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's been moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7005.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's been moved up to the science lab and with appropriate arrangements so that the youngsters can come and go freely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7014.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just might also announce, if I can, Madam Mayor, that tomorrow at noontime, the Medford High School band will be playing at the Science Museum<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7023.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, for a special announcement from former New York mayor, Michael Bloomberg and Medford resident, uh, who I believe will be making a major presentation to the science museum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v1uxY5eDG_Y&t=7050.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No need to come back up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=892.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=896.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=897.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've prepared some materials for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=899.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Special Needs Director and our Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education to speak to the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=906.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=908.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot going on of response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=911.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Occasionally, in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=916.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r blynyddoedd yn dechrau, mae rhai o'r blant yn ymdrech ar eu hunain, ac yna rydyn ni'n ymateb i hynny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=921.257s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pan ddod o'r wybodaeth i ni, mae'r ysgol hwnnw wedi cael ei ymweld â'r ysgolion hwnnw mewn nifer o weithiau, gan both Diane ac Cathy, ac mae rhai planau ar gael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=929.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, dydw i ddim yn credu ei fod yn anodd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=931.22s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dydw i'n credu y bydd y Roberts yn cael rhai broblemau o'r poblogaeth, ond nid y bydd yr ysgolion eraill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=935.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Os ydych chi ar y Columbus, mae gennych y rhaglen dysgu therapeutig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=938.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yn ysgolion eraill,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=945.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: y Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=945.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yn rhai blynyddoedd, mae'r Maglynyddoedd wedi cael mwy o bobl na'r Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=948.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r bywydau'n mynd ymlaen drwy'r geografiaeth, i ryw ffyrdd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=950.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ond, wrth ddweud hynny, rhaid i mi gofyn i Diane a Cathy i ddod ymlaen a siarad ychydig ychydig am y syniadau y mae Mrs. Rodrigues wedi'u hyrwyddo, ac rwy'n eisiau gwneud hynny'n dda iawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=961.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dydyn ni ddim yn bwysig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=962.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dyna ddim ymwneud ag yr hyn sy'n digwydd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2263.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, os ydw i'n gallu ymdrechu ar hynny i ddau munud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2272.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r sefyllfa sy'n digwydd, mae pobl yn ymdrechu ar hynny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2275.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Deallwch ni ddim ysgolio hynny i gael mwy o bobl sy'n teimlo y bydd yna rhywbeth tragic sy'n digwydd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2281.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nid yw.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2281.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ychydig o flynyddoedd,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2285.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yn y lle oedd Columbus yn cael y rhaglen dysgu therapeutig.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2286.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae rhai o'r bobl wedi'i ysgrifennu i'r rhaglen gweithredu gweithredol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2288.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ac roedd rhai o'r ysgrifennwyr yn cael problemau serios, ac roeddent yn gwneud ffwrdd, ac roedd rhai o'r bobl yn dweud, ydych chi'n gwybod, beth fyddwn ni'n mynd i'r bobl hynny?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2295.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni'n ymddiried arno, rydyn ni'n gweithio arno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2297.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni'n ymweld â pharentau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2297.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni'n ymweld â phobl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2299.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni'n gwneud yr hyn rydyn ni'n rhaid ei wneud<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2775.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dydw i eisiau gwneud hynny'n dda iawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2955.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r system ysgol yn ddiddorol iawn, ond rydyn ni hefyd, dim ond ychydig... Iodd eich bod chi ddim yn gobeithio'r hyn sy'n bwysig iawn mewn bywyd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3397.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae nifer o gofynnau wedi'u gwneud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3411.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Rydyn ni wedi'u gwneud y gofyn hwn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3412.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pan ddechreuodd St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3413.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Francis, dywedodd DCR nad oedd angen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3424.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ac rydyn ni'n meddwl ei fod yn anodd, ac mae'n rhaid i ni ddweud ymlaen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3426.473s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ond dyna oedd rhan o'r cyfarfodydd yn y diwrnod diwethaf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3429.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diolch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=115.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things you need to remember is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=118.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In this report, the way it's set up, the distribution of undistributed due to contract negotiations was moved after the fact so that when that gets moved, they're not over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=130.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just simply reflect that contract negotiations took place and that those contributions went over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=138.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=140.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we report it so you see it in totality in the raw score rather than move the money around and then you just balance it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=148.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll just show it to you the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=150.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in a non-negotiated year, in a year where we're not negotiating a contract, those numbers have already been worked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=156.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you won't see that this year, but you might see it in another negotiated year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=162.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=164.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Set the report in place on file, Madam Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=226.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that would be more appropriate for the current fiscal year, as opposed to the one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=232.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just passed because that year is over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=234.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=234.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we're looking at, now we'll look at this year's report to date and make a recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=310.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't we take that under advisement and see how we can do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=313.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll get right back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=814.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's my only- You actually taught her how to read this stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=817.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=829.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, don't make that mistake again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=858.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call on our deputy superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1523.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might want to know that Boston Latin is level two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1527.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It gives you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1529.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't an academic issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1531.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a participation issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1533.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we see it in Andover High School and a lot of other places that you would consider to be immune to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1540.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1541.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a whole discussion that has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1544.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may remember when AYP, annual adequate yearly progress, was the benchmark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1550.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And everyone was going to be proficient by 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1552.774s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At some point around 2012, 80% of the schools couldn't make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1559.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they had to scratch it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1561.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because it was an unrealistic target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1564.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As long as you're going to set up some of these, these parameters that don't work for certain youngsters, you're going to have difficulty making it on the participation level or on the, you know, achievement level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1576.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is what we're facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1578.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be some discussions at the state level about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1581.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new federal act ESSA gives the states more flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1585.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what they do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1587.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see how, what kind of discussion they have on that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1591.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously, if they don't have a discussion, you're going to see the same phenomenon as you saw with AYP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1598.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be more and more districts that drop down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1601.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not going to fly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1811.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a discussion between the House and the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1816.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1817.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have different viewpoints on the bilingual or ELL laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1822.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate would like to change what the UNS amendment did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1825.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House is still moving around on it a little bit, and they haven't been able to reach any kind of consensus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1834.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of ferment around this stuff right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1837.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other thing I think that becomes obvious to us is that these tests,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1845.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, last year they try to use something called the equity percentile to try to find some sort of crossover between MCAS and park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1855.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it was a very full attempt to try and compare two very different tests and notice the state isn't going to do it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1862.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1863.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously somebody came to the same conclusion, even though, you know, last year we said to them, we don't think this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1872.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1874.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they came to the conclusion that since they couldn't really compare all the districts and we think to some degree that impacted our scores last year and impacted our rating last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1884.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's just our thinking about it, but I can't prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=1886.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2205.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yep, because we'll have to find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2257.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just up to you to decide who you want to be the delegate on the, on the alternate to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2261.558s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, we put it off from last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2264.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2327.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we gave you a report on the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2330.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're actually spelled out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2331.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, if someone wanted to only go for one or two days, MASC indicated that we could talk to them about it, depending on what their numbers look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2341.135s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and their costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2344.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, hotels would be different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2345.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a registration cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2346.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hotels or whatever they are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/5T-XCQueORE&t=2349.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Generally about $100 a night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=369.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Van der Kloot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=892.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=896.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=897.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've prepared some materials for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=899.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Special Needs Director and our Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education to speak to the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=906.685s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=908.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot going on of response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=911.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Occasionally, in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=916.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mae'r blynyddoedd yn dechrau, mae rhai o'r blant yn ymdrechu ar eu hunain, ac yna rydym yn ymdrechu ar hynny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=921.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pan fydd y wybodaeth i ni, mae'r ysgol wedi'i ymweld â nhw mewn nifer o weithiau, gan boeth Diane ac Cathy, ac mae rhai planau ar gael.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=929.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Felly, dydw i ddim yn credu ei fod yn anodd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=931.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dydw i'n credu y bydd y Roberts yn cael rhai broblemau o bobl, ond nid y bydd yr ysgolau eraill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=950.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ond, wrth ddweud hynny, rhaid i mi gofyn i Diane a Cathy i ddod ymlaen a siarad ychydig ychydig am y syniadau y mae Mrs. Rodrigues wedi'u hyrwyddo, ac rwy'n eisiau gwneud hynny'n dda iawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=572.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we met with Mrs. Rodriguez this morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=575.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went over all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=576.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've prepared some materials for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=578.763s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our special needs director and our assistant for elementary education to speak to the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=586.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=588.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot going on of response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=590.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Occasionally, in a given classroom, there's going to be some disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=594.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The year starts, some youngsters express themselves, and then we respond to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=599.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When information comes to us, that classroom's been visited multiple times by both Diane and by Kathy, and there's some plans in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=609.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't believe it's undoable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=611.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe the Roberts does have some population issues, but so don't the other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=614.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're at the Columbus, you have the therapeutic learning program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=618.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At other schools, you have other programs that are there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=621.974s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some years, the Brooks has had more people than the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=625.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In some years, the McGlynn has had more people than the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=627.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Population shifts are by geography to some degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=631.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, let me ask Diane and Kathy to come up and talk a little bit about the specifics that Mrs. Rodriguez has raised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=640.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make it very clear, we're very concerned when things happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=644.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not unconcerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=646.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not a fair assessment of what goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=648.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but let them speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1945.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just if I can comment on that for a minute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1951.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A situation happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1953.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People are responding to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1955.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's not escalate it up and get more people feeling like there's something tragic going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1960.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1962.971s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some years, a place like the Columbus had the therapeutic learning program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1967.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people used to call it the behavior management program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1970.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of those youngsters had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1972.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some serious issues, and they were making noise, and some people said, well, gee, you know, we're gonna move those people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1978.35s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We deal with it, we work with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1980.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will contact parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1982.353s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll meet with people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1983.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do what we have to do to allay the fears of students, but let's not escalate it at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1989.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's deal with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1990.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a situation that occurred in a single classroom at a point in time at the beginning of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=1997.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The two students who weren't on the radar, who aren't IEP students,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2003.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2003.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll do the diligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2005.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll look at the makeup of the classes and make some recommendations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2009.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's keep it calm, and let's be surgical about it, rather than try to raise and elevate concerns where they may not exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2021.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people may be more anxious than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2023.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll talk to people about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2025.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll talk to people about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2026.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we did meet with Mrs. Rodriguez, as she's coming to the microphone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2030.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did meet with her today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2031.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We talked with her today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2032.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will talk to other people, but let's do it surgically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2035.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's do it, you know, directly that way rather than try to expand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2454.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No question in my mind they don't know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2639.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that she doesn't forget what's really important in life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2646.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While you're watching those pitiful lions play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2659.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been trying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=2659.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We bought a bracelet so that she will find whoever she is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3076.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are, there've been several requests made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3079.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a new request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3080.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And representative Donato has a bunch of stone wall with a DCR.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3086.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if we get multiple, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3091.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: reps requesting it, perhaps that will get a little bit more steam on it, but it's been difficult because this is not a new request that we've been making this request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3098.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When St.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3099.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Francis closed, DCR determined it wasn't necessary, but we think it's necessary and we just have to keep banging your way at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3106.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that was part of the meeting the other day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3562.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam chairperson, we're going to call upon our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3728.076s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chairperson, Tony Vento, our supervisor of health services is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3732.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We brought this to your attention last year when we got involved with the opiate intervention activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=3740.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Tony's going to bring you up to date on SBIRT, which is the acronym for this long title, and let you know what we're doing and how it's going at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=4421.034s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this time, we'll call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5667.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me jump in on that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5669.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Every school has got a different reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5672.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You would expect more suspensions at the high school and the middle schools than you would typically at the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5677.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it can't really be system wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5680.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really got to be looked at in terms of the specific school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5684.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the specific teachers are different than the specific school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5689.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So teachers don't suspend youngsters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5692.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And these are teacher goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5694.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are evaluation of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5696.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think you're by putting percentages, we're giving them an unrealistic role to play because they don't really do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5703.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really done through the, through the office in conjunction with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5707.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have total control of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5709.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think what you're going to see from us coming up next after this is system wide goals would have nothing to do with specifically the teacher goals, but rather what the school system is trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5720.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you might find that as a more realistic percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=5734.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: More of a refinement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6448.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chairperson, members of the committee, just an update on what's going on in Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6453.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was a district wide vote among the Minuteman communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6457.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 16 communities voted on September 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6463.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 10% of the population in those 16 communities came out to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6466.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some communities only had 2%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6468.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of the communities are withdrawing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6470.872s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 16 communities in Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6473.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's down to 10 now and by the end of this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6476.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then Belmont looks like it will withdraw, so it'll bring it down to nine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6482.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This gives you an idea of what's going on, but they will get to build their building, but they'll build it for a number that I don't believe they're going to fulfill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6492.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The one thing I want to bring to your attention is that our population is decreasing at Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6498.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think within two years, we'll have no one there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6501.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But should we have someone there, one of the provisions of the new regulations called for a capital fee, which we feel is an unfunded mandate, and we will contest with many of the communities that are on this back sheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6514.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the commissioners put it out, and it gives you an idea of how many communities are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6519.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's like 34 outside of the district communities, most of whom will object to that fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6526.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think that they've underestimated the actual cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6529.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think that Minuteman could cost a place like Arlington, New England, $30,000 to $40,000 per student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6535.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward, I think it's absurd, but it is what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6539.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think we'll be out of it, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6542.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: informed, and I want you to know that we will, with other communities that are out of district, be initiating appropriate legal action through the Division of Local Mandates, and then, if necessary, through the courts, to avoid any kind of possibility that a capital fee could actually come home to roost at some point should an individual come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6564.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't believe that's appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6566.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have equity in the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6568.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't believe the number is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6570.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We believe that it's an overbuilt school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6573.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But nevertheless, it's in place and keep you posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6576.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think our vocational school is doing extremely well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6579.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we think that in a couple of years, we won't have anyone going anywhere outside of our own school, except for possibly an agricultural school, which is beyond us unless you're prepared to buy a cow and a horse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6591.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you are, let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6593.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can look at that, but I don't think that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6596.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6597.824s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6614.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chairperson, making her final appearance before the Method School Committee, Pat Villiers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6748.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one of the things you need to remember is that in this report, the way it's set up, the distribution of undistributed due to contract negotiations was moved after the fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6761.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that when that gets moved, they're not over the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6763.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They just simply reflect that contract negotiations took place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6768.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that those contributions went over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6771.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's just the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6773.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the way we report it, so you see it in totality in the raw score rather than move the money around and then you just balance it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6781.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just show it to you the way it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6783.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in a non-negotiated year, in a year where we're not negotiating a contract, those numbers have already been worked in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6789.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you won't see that this year, but you might see it in another negotiated year, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6797.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Set the report place on file, Madam Chairman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6859.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that would be more appropriate for the current fiscal year, as opposed to the one that we just passed, because that year's over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6867.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6867.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now we're looking at this year's report to date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6870.644s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6943.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't we take that under advisement and see how we can do it, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=6946.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get right back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7447.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, that's my own- Do I click Charter how to read this stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7462.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine, don't make that mistake.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7491.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're gonna call on our deputy superintendent to deliver this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=7496.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good or bad?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8156.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you might want to know that Boston Latin is level two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8160.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Gives you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8162.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't an academic issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8163.995s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8164.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a participation issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8166.686s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we see it in Andover High School and a lot of other places that you would consider to be immune to this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8173.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8174.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a whole discussion that has to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8177.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may remember when AYP, annual adequate yearly progress, was the benchmark and everyone was going to be proficient by 2014.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8185.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At some point around 2012, 80% of the schools couldn't make it, so they had to scratch it because it was an unrealistic target.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8197.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As long as you're going to set up some of these, these parameters that don't work for certain youngsters, you're going to have difficulty making it on the participation level or on the achievement level as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8209.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is what we're facing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8211.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there'll be some discussions at the state level about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8214.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The new federal act ESSA gives the states more flexibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8218.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what they do with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8220.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see how, what kind of discussion they have on that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8224.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because obviously, if they don't have a discussion, you're going to see the same phenomenon as you saw with AYP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8231.129s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be more and more districts that drop down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8234.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's not going to fly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8445.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a, um, discussion between the house and the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8449.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're both,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8450.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have different viewpoints on the bilingual or ELL laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8454.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, the Senate would like to change what the uns amendment did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8458.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The house is still moving around on it a little bit and they haven't been able to reach a, uh, any kind of consensus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8467.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot of ferment around this stuff right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8470.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other, the other thing I think that that becomes obvious to us is, is that, uh, these tests, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8479.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Last year they tried to use something called the equity percentile to try to find some sort of crossover between MCAS and park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8488.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think it was a very full attempt to try and compare two very different tests and notice the state isn't going to do it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8496.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously somebody came to the same conclusion, even though, you know, last year we said to them, we don't think this works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8505.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8507.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they came to the conclusion that since they couldn't really compare all the districts, and we think to some degree that impacted our scores last year and impacted our rating last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8517.579s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's just our thinking about it, but I can't prove it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8519.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, so be it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8836.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm trying to assess how many students are involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8890.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just up to you to decide who you want to be the delegate on the, on the alternate to the conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8894.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, we put it off from last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8897.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8960.596s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we gave you a report on the costs that are actually spelled out for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bJh5u_BBkes&t=8964.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if someone wanted to only go for one or two days, MASC indicated that we could talk to them about it, depending on what their numbers look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=105.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the School Committee, you have the paper in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=109.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to make the introductions of Team Medford, who have been incredibly generous to us, not only this year, but throughout the years, providing school supplies to our teachers and our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=452.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm here members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=454.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did give you a preliminary report on August 29th and update that this evening and go over a few things that maybe you didn't get at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=463.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've had eight days of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=466.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for the last two weeks, and the kindergartners had four days of school, and we've had a pretty good overall opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=472.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Student enrollment is still emerging, as our parent center continues to receive daily activity, enrollees coming from many places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=482.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as of Friday, September 9th, our overall enrollment is, at this point in time, 37 students less than last year at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=490.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current numbers are as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=493.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Elementary, 1,882.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=496.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Less, about two than last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=498.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The middle school, 943, an increase of 51.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=501.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the high school vocational school, 1365, a reduction of 86.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=506.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, last year's eighth grade class was much lower than the previous class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=511.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That explains some of it, but, you know, at this particular point in time, I think it's probably on percentage about the same going to the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=519.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det är förväntat att de här utbildningsnivåerna förändras i september.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=523.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det kommer studenter att registrera sig, och några studenter kommer att flytta.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=527.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det här är typiskt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=528.394s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dessutom måste distributionen mellan högskolan och vocational school fortfarande refineras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=534.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det är för att vi samarbetar och gör saker samtidigt, så det är mer än 101 studenter i 9. klasse<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=546.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to the vocational school and exploratory, even though the vocational ninth grade is only about 52 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=552.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you get the idea that there's another 50 plus students, or there are around 50 students coming from the high school in the ninth grade exploring programs, and there's other youngsters in the other grades exploring programs as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=564.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are students coming from the vocational school taking courses at the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=568.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as we merge, some of these lines will blur a little bit, but we need to break it out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=574.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for reporting purposes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=577.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Class sizes across the district are good and well within contractual limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=582.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've provided a chart to you that Diane's office has produced with Michelle Bissell working at it, talking to all the principals every day to make sure that we get actual headcounts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=594.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane actually went down and did some headcounts today to be sure that the number registered and the numbers actually in attendance are reconciled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=604.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the secondary school looks pretty good also, but we'll wait a few more days until we see how classes are redistributed as people change courses and make some adjustments as to what they're taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=617.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year, we made four administrative appointments that filled vacancies covered by two resignations, one retirement, and one promotion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=626.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we reduced one administrative position in the special education budget during budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=634.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were 32 new teachers hired to fill gaps caused by resignations, retirements, leaves of absence, and non-rehires.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=642.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there were multiple shifts of teachers to different positions to better address enrollment and program needs based on individual building preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=650.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, we hired a few new positions based on our budget deliberations, including one middle school librarian, one math coach, one middle school adjustment Councilor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=664.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: behavior specialist and three full-time kindergarten aides from previously part-time aides at the Robins.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=670.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were also able to cover both clerical reductions with internal transfers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=675.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were multiple changes among paraprofessionals and we're working on a full listing that's still evolving a little bit and we'll provide that to you as soon as we feel comfortable that it's solid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=687.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School security plans are in place at all schools and principals have been conducting practice drills<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=693.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the first couple of days of school, I visited the schools and walked over to some of them, and everyone was evacuating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=699.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I thought maybe school wasn't going to happen, but they were actually practicing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=704.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there was no disruption to school operations caused by the September 8, 2016 primary election at five of our school sites.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=713.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will be closed for the November election, since that's a much heavier election, being a presidential election, and the turnout should be close to 80% versus the 15% or so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=723.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: som kommer till primär.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=725.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation routes are going through the typical initial adjustments to reflect actual ridership and route timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=731.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat is working very hard with the company.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=734.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're doing a good job, again, in making adjustments, trying to make sure that the buses are properly, let's say, filled but not overfilled, and making some adjustments based on changes in individual student situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=753.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Initial reports indicate that there's increased ridership around the district, and that we've used the Transfinder system, which we used this year to help smooth out some of these routes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=766.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also want to thank the Eastern Bus in Tatiana Hall, who coordinates with Pat on the bus routes for their close work with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=775.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School supplies, as you just heard, and other budget education materials have been ordered and much is in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=782.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a few more distributions to take place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=784.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're grateful to Team Medford and other groups for their generous support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=788.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At our next meeting, we'll recognize other groups who have provided for our students as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=793.284s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some nice substantial donations to augment what we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=798.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are implementing our revised supply list plan that reduces individual supply list requests of parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=804.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In fact, this evening when we were down in the McGlynn, I talked to representatives of the PTO down there and they asked how they could<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=811.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Provide supplies without hitting parents up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=814.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we talked about a methodology for doing that in a more generalized way so that parents, individual parents, don't feel obligated or coerced to providing supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=823.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are many parents out there that can't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=826.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They have multiple children and we want to be fair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=831.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a new substitute software system, which we call ASOP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=835.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's working well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=836.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=837.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: more substitutes available to us than ever before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=840.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think there were like 60 on the list, Pat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=843.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Previously this time we might have 20, 30 at the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=847.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so this is going to be an important year for providing full coverage to our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=854.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are transmitting, transitioning rather, from our previous student information system, which is I-PASS, to our new system, which is called School Brains.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=865.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will take some time to work out all the particulars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=869.49s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Technology glitches are part of what we have to deal with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=873.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we have a meeting on Wednesday to work out some of the information transfer that we don't think went quite as smoothly as we would have liked it to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=882.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we don't think it's going to, let's say, create any kind of problems down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=888.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as teachers learn to use it, we feel it will reach its optimum utilization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=893.927s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We completed FY 2016 with a balanced budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=897.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Final transactions are being implemented now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=900.489s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A report will be forthcoming when all records are reconciled with City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=904.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're entering fiscal 17 in good shape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=907.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to keep an eye on possible state aid reductions in our cost overruns for programs, services, and facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=913.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state is seeing lower revenues, and who knows, it might trigger 9C cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=919.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's always out there looming sometime in the late fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=923.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Vi har fortfunding som kan tillåts från olika grupper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=927.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det är inte klart om legislaturen kommer att förbereda nytta förfunding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=932.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Vi måste också se på alla typer av aktioner i Washington som fortgår i den här tiden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=936.007s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I de kommande veckor kommer vi att samarbeta om våra mål och vi fortsätter som vi har progresserat i året.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=940.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ni har några plattformar.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=941.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ni kan se dem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=942.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Det är plattformen för utbildning i distrikten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=953.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a chart broken out by actual grades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=955.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a chart broken out just by school and grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=959.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's the elementary class chart that breaks out by teachers and the actual grade levels at each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=969.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, it looks pretty good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=970.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions you might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=982.228s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As of Friday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=983.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of today's, we just, we made some adjustments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1264.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me answer it, because I know what you're asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1267.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those classrooms are for integration of special needs youngsters, and that might happen in a gymnasium, that might happen in an art class,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1274.64s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may happen in some other, let's say, elective type class, but not in the regular classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1294.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see that at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1296.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Generally, the classes down there, if they've got inclusion, they're part of the original count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1302.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1306.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: När de samlas, kommer andra lärarna med?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1307.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ja, de kommer med.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1307.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Även med full-time-aids, i kindergården, tror jag att det är fortfarande högt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1348.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I feel obligated to say this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1351.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're spoiled in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1353.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are spoiled in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1354.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You should see the class sizes around the Commonwealth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1357.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are spoiled in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1358.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are so used to having low class sizes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1361.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that any time it peaks a little bit higher, it becomes a major issue in some people's minds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1367.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are very good class sizes for public school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1372.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you look around the Commonwealth, you won't find better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1376.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know we'd like to have less, but an additional teacher with benefits and everything is gonna cost you in a classroom, cost you another $100,000 for one or two students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1387.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that we can adjust the actual instruction<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1391.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can ask the principal to carefully review from time to time whether the 24-21 makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1399.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it really becomes an issue, maybe we can talk about an aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1403.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think we should be in the business of just simply adding teachers and adding classrooms when we're at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1410.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's easy to make the argument, but I can tell you that our class sizes are among the best in the Commonwealth, much better than our neighbors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1449.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, remember, some of these are a function of youngsters who do have a need to be in certain schools because of certain, let's say, programs that are at that school, as opposed to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1461.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, clearly they're close enough, you know, for us to do it, and it's certainly well within the class size limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1468.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In each grade level, 25 students in a class would be 200 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1476.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you had 25 students in a class, you'd have 200 students in that grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1480.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Så du har åtta klasser i varje skola, som är delade i det numret, och det visar dig hur stor klassen är.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1489.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dessutom har du några specifikeringsproblem, som kan ta den numren ännu mindre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1494.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: De klasserna är väldigt bra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1507.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that, you know, every time someone says, well, it's a little too high, that we start saying, okay, add a teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1512.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That takes away from other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2273.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, Members of the Committee, our Deputy Superintendent will bring you up to date on the Administrative Meetings and also our Teacher Induction Program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2568.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, our Director of Science, Rocco Sierra, is here to brief you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2576.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just going to show you the booklet that contains the standards that everyone's supposed to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2583.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll make sure you get a copy so you can study them on your own in your own leisure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=2588.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Meanwhile, Rocco will tell you all about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3049.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Så om du minns från våra budgetdeliberationer, vi kommer att bli klar med att betala för InVision i det här året, och sen det pengar kommer att flytta över till Science at the elementary level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3063.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Vi vill se på nästa året om vi kan lägga pengar in i curriculum science elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3069.956s">[Roy Belson]</a>: envision which will be over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3211.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, our assistant superintendent will tell us about before school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3486.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3488.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, we need to keep it for situations where there may be a shortfall, someone doesn't, or can't pay at some point in time, there may be some scholarships that are generated because of low income.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3501.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whatever's left over is figured into our overall revenue plan, because obviously we have to offset our budget with revenue, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5113.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, after our deliberations and interviews on August 29th, you gave me your input and this evening it's my pleasure<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5126.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to recommend to you that the Director of Finance and Administrative position be awarded to Kirsteen Patterson, who is currently in Southern Middlesex Vocational Tech, and she's here this evening, and you have the documents in front of you, and that I'd ask for a formal vote nominating and electing Kirsteen to the position for two-year contract at the rate that's stipulated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5205.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I remember the committee every year we select a delegate and alternative alternate to the M.A.S.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5211.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: conference in Hyannis and it's important that we do that so we can submit it to M.A.S.C.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5218.471s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and let them know and also to let you know that if you expect to attend I would like to register you as soon as possible so we can get the optimum rates for the conference and we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5231.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an important activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5232.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's so much going on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5234.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's so many changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5235.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a new federal law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5238.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You need to be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5239.778s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can tell you a lot of things, but you need to have an opportunity to interact with your colleagues in those settings and see what other people are talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5248.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and get an idea of what's really happening in the Commonwealth and the federal government as we move forward with public education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5253.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year is particularly significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5256.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A couple of things in front of us that could alter the nature of what we do, especially ESSA, charter schools, other things that could happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5265.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's important that you interact with your colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5267.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would ask that you nominate a delegate and an alternate, and at the same token,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5273.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give me information as to whether you intend to attend, so I can make appropriate arrangements on your behalf.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5394.096s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe it's on this particular, but I'll certainly provide it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5397.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5707.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5708.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This evening you've received a packet from our public information office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5712.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are many terrific activities going on in our city over the next couple of weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5716.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I urge you to pay attention to them because I know you want to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5720.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate that Lisa has put all this together for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5724.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And to let you know that there's many events and that, you know, our people will be participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5730.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Community Day, it's Tufts Community Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5732.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The 25th is... Crystal Campbell unveiling is September 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5737.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Crystal Campbell unveiling, former Medford High School student who was lost in the Marathon bombing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5743.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5745.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I also want to point out to you that varsity teams are undefeated right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5753.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And anybody who thinks that the Patriots win or the Red Sox win yesterday was important on the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5760.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Mustangs winning on Friday night was the most important win of the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5765.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We came back and beat Revere 30 to 28.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5768.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Great win for our guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5770.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're off to a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5771.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're looking for number two next Friday at Belmont.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5774.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll look forward to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5775.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And also, the boys' soccer team traveled to Ludlow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5780.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ludlow is a perennial state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5782.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've won 17 state soccer championships for boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5786.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Medford has been in the state championship game three times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5789.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And each time we lost a lot of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5794.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I played in the first one and we got beat the worst.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5798.299s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll take I'll take the heat for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5800.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is is this time for the last two times we played them, we've tied them one to one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5805.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The next time we play them, we're going to win.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5808.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just so you know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5810.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5967.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may come out to vote a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=140.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, you have a report in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=143.669s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a preliminary report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=145.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you know, school opens tomorrow for grades<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=149.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 1 through 12.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=150.563s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kindergarten will come in next week on September 7th, on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=156.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In preparation for the opening of school, administrators have been meeting all last week and all throughout the summer, hiring and reviewing necessary policies, protocols, and programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=167.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've also participated in meetings with our new teachers, staff, contractors to ensure they're off to a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=174.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Enrollment in the school is increasing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=177.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll reserve judgment on the need for maybe additional faculty or staff until we see who actually shows up in the first week or so of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=187.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll calculate actual attendance at that time, which is typical practice for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=192.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Transportation routes are posted online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=195.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We used Transfinder this year, our first time using that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=199.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As usual, adjustments are made during the first month to reflect actual ridership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=203.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're working to consolidate at least one bus<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=206.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and possibly downsize one bus to a smaller vehicle heading to Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=212.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Security plans are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=213.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All schools have updated their plans and scheduled drills to practice the various response measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=218.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached a copy of a recent article which I sent you previously, but in case you didn't see it, on the bomb scares in Medford Public Schools and was in the American School Board's journal featuring Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=232.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A preliminary report on our summer maintenance and repair work has been included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=236.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. McLaughlin is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=237.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot was done, a lot more will be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=240.979s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight we'll discuss capital planning, which is another dimension of our building repairs and long-term improvement of our facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=250.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additional work was completed in our buildings with the help of the vocational school faculty and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=255.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're awarding a new contract to cleaning service sometime this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=261.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've interviewed multiple vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=263.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've narrowed it down to four individuals, four individual groups, and we should have a decision probably by tomorrow or no later than Thursday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=274.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on a new initiative that would have students, especially in the high school and the middle schools, adopt specific sections of their buildings for upkeep and improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=285.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Almost like what you see in the islands around the city where you adopt an island and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=290.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll have you some details on this initiative at a subsequent meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=295.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: After school and before school programs are ready to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=298.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Demand for these programs and services continues to grow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=301.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working hard to ensure that we have enough staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=304.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a little challenging as people come and go in this after school staff at the outset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=309.663s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And sometimes people become available if they feel they don't have another type of job for themselves at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=317.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Supplies materials are on hand for the opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=321.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: New techs have been ordered and will be in place this month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=324.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Team Medford, Hallmark Health, and they'll be with us on the meeting at the 12th, along with Armstrong Ambulance and Staples, presented over $27,000 worth of additional school supplies to us this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=337.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our athletic teams have been practicing and will be ready for their openings in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=341.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A fall schedule is included in your materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=344.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The marching band practices virtually every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=347.223s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and they'll be very active in our games and other community events this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=351.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've enclosed some additional articles that have been in the transcript and on our blog that highlight Medford school programs and in particular I put my first article into the transcript this week entitled standing up together for our Medford public schools and cover a lot of the things that went on and will go on in the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=369.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had several meetings with the transcript in an attempt to try and develop a new relationship<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=375.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that will be positive for the transcript and for the public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=379.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll follow up with a report on the actual opening of our schools at a regularly scheduled meeting on September 12, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=387.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, if we go to the next page, you'll see the typed copy of what was actually in the transcript on August 25th, listing many of the programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=399.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the interesting parts of this first part was that, you know, obviously I'm calling for parents to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=404.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: stay engaged with us and for us to work with them and to encourage their involvement and giving them ways that they can participate in your meetings and in conjunction with the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=414.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We spoke to the faculty about a similar thing this week and we think that we're making that a serious priority going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=422.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to read through this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=424.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know you've had opportunities to go through these things yourself and if you have any questions I'll be happy to comment on any of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=458.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's hard to know whether the buses are going to get there on time in the first week because in the first week a lot of people are still figuring it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=465.395s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people arrive at the stops a little bit late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=468.637s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think we schedule them to get there on time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=472.039s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, Pat may have another view.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=543.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the next part of the report has some materials on what was done in maintenance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=549.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John McLaughlin is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=550.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I won't try to read through it all because you have it in front of you, but if you have a specific question, John is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=556.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can answer some and John can answer anything else that you might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=562.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you have any questions about what was done in buildings and grounds, more is going to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=572.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're still working at things, but for the most part, we're very functional going into the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1576.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the rest of the packet on the opening is just some articles that we thought appeared recently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1583.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We thought you might like to just have another copy of them or look at them if you haven't seen them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1588.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And again, new teacher orientation was held.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1593.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put out some information about school brains, the new parent communication system that goes with our data management operations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1600.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had training today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1602.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on that with the teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1603.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The athletic schedule is here, the meeting schedule is here, and the school calendar is here again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1610.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, happy to take any questions you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1627.857s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure it is and we'll correct it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1629.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1630.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unless you want to come on the 16th and we'll be happy to hold a meeting for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1647.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because what you have is you have people coming and you have people going who don't tell us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1651.34s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1653.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, you'll get a class size chart in our first meeting in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1659.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That'll give us enough time to really see whether people are going to be with us or go or what it really looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1664.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it looks like we've got it under control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1667.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People can come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1669.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1690.362s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, when they actually show, we've got pretty good enrollments right now, but let's see what actually shows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1695.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are a little stressed on after school staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1699.633s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It seems like as people get jobs, they leave that program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1704.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's some turnover there, but everyone's working hard to make sure that that's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1730.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1792.883s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what we did was we certainly talked to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1797.113s">[Roy Belson]</a>: our principals and also to Ed Finn, the city clerk, about the location of each polling station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1803.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now at each polling station, there is a Medford police officer who will be assigned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1807.858s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they will be there, and the entrance to and from will be reserved strictly for the people polling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1814.88s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students will not go through those entrances or exits, and the people will not be allowed into the buildings in any other way, unless they're coming there for a student as well as election, and then they have to sign in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1829.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each polling area will have its own entrance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1833.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The police officer will be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1836.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1838.344s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, they rotate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1838.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not there all the time, but they rotate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1844.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I did speak to a few parents who called, and you know, someone might keep their youngster home for that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1850.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand some people are more concerned than others about that, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1854.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we start breaking up the beginning of school, we lose all momentum this first couple weeks of school because of Labor Day and other things that come up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1879.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm wondering whether or not if we wouldn't do something like a backpack express.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1883.332s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes robo calls kind of get people uptight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1886.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1887.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if we send them a letter from the school saying how it's going to be set up, that might be an easier way for them to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1895.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1901.535s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1904.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1906.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1907.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1962.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure we can set that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2003.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are some additional pieces of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2014.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as you know, the mayor has been working hard with her staff to create a capital plan for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2023.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the school system was asked to create our own capital plan based on our best estimates and judgment as to what we needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2031.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Naturally, the mayor wants each of you to have the opportunity to review what's in this document so that you can either add, subtract, or modify<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2041.13s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what's here as she continues with her plan to present something that's a system-wide plan to the city and the city council would obviously have to approve any kind of bonding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2054.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we do capital plans, there are four basic functions and we prioritize based on that basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2061.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Health and safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2061.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was a health and safety issue, we'd want to address that as early as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2066.137s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A functional need for the operation of the schools, something that would keep us from operating the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2071.575s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The third would be something of educational value, and the last would be a cosmetic improvement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2076.92s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Albeit, sometimes things are all of the above, or two or more of the above, but we try to at least deal with health and safety and functional needs first to the extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2089.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each project should be reviewed with an eye towards an alternative source of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2093.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've just passed out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2094.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: some information about something coming through MSBA on technology and DESE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2099.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've spoke to MSBA again today and DESE to get some latest information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2104.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We expect that an RFP will come out of DESE and MSBA in the next few weeks, and then we'll be able to respond more formally to any kind of technology investment that's involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2124.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have to be scheduled in ways that reduce or eliminate disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2127.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we did the science labs, you can see obviously we had to move a lot of people around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2131.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When we do anything that affects classroom space, we try to do it in a way that eliminates disruption or at least reduces it and doesn't impact operations to the greatest extent possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2147.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: have to be scheduled to reflect emergent or anticipated legal and as well as educational requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2154.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some things we have to do legally, for example, this year at the beginning we put in another ramp into the Caron Theater to meet the handicap requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2163.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other things like that would be necessary to consider.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2169.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Proposed project solicitance report based upon our best current cost estimates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2173.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been rounded out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2174.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I didn't try to get to $210.26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2177.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it's $200,000, it's $200,000, and it could be $5,000, $10,000, $15,000, more or less, one way or another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2186.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a preference for combining certain projects in any given year that could produce a preferred economy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2193.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the first step is obviously for you to review it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2195.934s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we broke it out by school, and we broke it out in five years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2201.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you look at<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2203.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The schools, you'll see that there's year one projections, year two projections, year three projections, year four and year five projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2210.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is also a piece for technology as the last item, and it's broken up into instructional technology and network technology, as well as district-wide and equipment needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2224.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we try to break it out in categories that were easy to understand and to give us a sense of how we would distribute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2230.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, as the mayor points out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2233.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a preliminary list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2235.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's intended to get the conversation going to keep you involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2239.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, at the same token, it's still aspirational at this point, and a lot depends on what other needs exist in the city and what other things can be done through alternative source of funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2249.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to begin by thanking Pat for putting the technical side of this all together and working very hard with other school officials with John and others to identify<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2261.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: what we thought we needed, sat down and went over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2264.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to thank the city's Procurement Officer Schaub for her work in trading ideas with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2269.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have an individual sheet for each project or each area, so you can look at that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2275.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think having said all of that, Madam Mayor, I think we're ready to take any feedback, and I would suggest we go school by school, go down the list, and if you see something that you think isn't there,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2289.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let us know, and if you see something that you don't think deserves attention, let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2293.507s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you think we're not spending enough of the mayor's money, then let us know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2298.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're happy to spend money, we like to spend money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2392.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, if I can, you know, the playgrounds are functional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2396.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They may not be beautiful because of the, you know, the rips in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2399.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can patch them and make them functional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2402.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some things that we need to do because the building air quality or safety factors would be far more significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2410.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, but that's why this is a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2412.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is where you would feed in and say, you know, I think that's more of an issue than you thought it was an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2417.894s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, we try to spread it out so that as the mayor points out,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2422.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As she goes over what her needs are citywide, that there's some distribution across a time frame that's believable financially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2431.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, it's all interchangeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2434.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's why we're here talking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2460.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, we get site council reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2463.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We look at those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2464.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John McLaughlin is obviously involved in every school with buildings and repairs and things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2469.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat and I have seen any number of requests over a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2473.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've also been conscious of things we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2476.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So for example, the vocational school, we know when we did a compliance audit that we know we have to change the door handles on doors to stay compliant because of their handicapped accessibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2487.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we tried to take all the pieces of information that came from multiple sources<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2492.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We met with principals at the end of the school year, we've talked to them since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2497.348s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we get input from virtually everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2499.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, I'm sure different people would have different priorities because obviously, if it's theirs, it's a higher priority than if it's someone else's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2611.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2631.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, signage is probably more of an operating budget item, you know, unless it were major pieces of signage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2637.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, in general science, we do that through operating budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2641.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, we'll sit down with Dr. Perella and find out what he has in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2726.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we were semi-finalists and we didn't become finalists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2731.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can't believe the poor judgment on the part of the Jobs Foundation, but nevertheless, you know, the idea is still there and the enthusiasm in the school is still there, but the funding that we had hoped for that particular source is not there for us right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2745.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there may be some other source of funding that we can look at and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2750.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that funding is not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2757.091s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can certainly add the library as an item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2759.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The question is, you know, what do we want to, what do we project for that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2763.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's something we'd have to do a little bit of homework on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2766.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a big place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2768.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Depends what we want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2770.056s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Furniture would be involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2772.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Certainly rugs, ceilings, lighting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2774.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a major expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2776.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would estimate just off the top, we're talking at least a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2812.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So again you know this is the beginning of a capital plan and there's a lot of things on here we probably haven't fully discussed but internally we're aware of things that should be done from our standpoint so the idea with modular units is that space at the high school is becoming premium<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2829.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and more and more programs are being developed at the vocational school and other activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2834.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, the thought was if we can recapture the skateboard park, we may want to build on what is the skateboard park now for a certain number of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2843.944s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that would be a very interesting way for us to expand our programming while at the same time using space that right now is badly used in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2886.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try and say it this way, because I think this is probably the best way to, because we're going to go through this question over and over again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2892.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are probably a lot of things that you haven't, as a committee, envisioned because you don't live it every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2897.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are other things you would know about, or think about, or hear about that we haven't thought too hard about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2902.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like, you know, you just mentioned the library, we thought maybe, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2904.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's going to be some back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2906.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not a final document, but this is a preliminary planning document to get your input, to see what kinds of concerns either you have for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2914.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: inclusion or deletion so that we can move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2917.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then as we move forward, then we would clearly detail each of our items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2923.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward also, remember,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2926.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: once year one goes or year two goes, it may be that year three, four, and five change dramatically after year one and two because of other considerations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2933.672s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is a plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2936.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A plan is subject to change, is subject to modification all the way through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2940.897s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just an attempt to try and lay out what we see and what might be possible and challenge us to think about what could be to our advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3032.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When this high school was built, there were over 25 schools in the school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3035.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And while they were smaller, they housed any number of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3039.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, there was the Forest Street complex<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3041.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which has the office of the superintendent and a number of other programs as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3046.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As we consolidated down those programs, you know, I mean those spaces get pushed into other areas, that's one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3053.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, special education has grown exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3058.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: ELL has grown exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3060.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Other mandated programs that we have put in place that didn't previously exist have grown exponentially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3065.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our vocational school has expanded<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3068.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: exponentially in terms of programs so we're doing more with the space we have and we have less total space than we had years ago so clearly you know it's not the same ballgame that it was when<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3081.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: this building housed, I don't think we ever got to 4,000, but about 3,600, 3,700.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3085.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we exaggerated a little because it sounded really good, you know, back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3090.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think the reality was is that, and also back then, there was open campus, if you remember, and not everybody had a room every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3097.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you were, you know, didn't have a class, you might have been in the cafeteria, you weren't in the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3103.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are a lot of factors that would mitigate against these things, and plus the fact, too, that there's specialized areas now, occupational therapy, vision testing, things of that type that we didn't have back then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3147.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think one of the things you need to do is assume the early iterations of some, let's say, modular classrooms<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3153.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: maybe look like trailers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3156.267s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've had some that looked a little bit like a trailer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3158.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were more wooden structures at the Davenport, at the Fulton, and places like that at different times in history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3165.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But today's modular classrooms, you wouldn't know the difference just from the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3170.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What they can do today is prefab housing, prefab buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3176.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3177.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They slap them up, and they put them together very nicely, and they're durable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3180.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and they've got steel and they've got other things in them that are more expensive, to be sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3184.989s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they can easily be put up and they do create legitimate space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3189.453s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the day of the trailer-like modular classroom has gone away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3226.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, if we could maybe take a few second breaks so we could prepare for the next activity and we get the first candidate in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3246.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In your packets you have a job description, you have some sample questions, you have some questions you can ask, and you have the resumes of each of the finalists in this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3258.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As I indicated to you in a cover letter,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3261.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were well over 20 individuals who applied for this position, some of whom did not have appropriate credentials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3269.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They liked the job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3271.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there were some other people who had credentials, but reference checks and other things had us eliminated from Chrome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3277.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there were some people who actually declined after they thought about it for various reasons or took a position elsewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3284.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think this evening we have three very fine individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3287.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the process for those of you who have not done it before, the veterans who have done it before as we've had interviews of this type, is that we ask our candidate to give us a little bit of information about themselves, to tell us a little bit of why they think they should be our Director of Finance and Administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3308.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We then go around the room and give each of you a chance to ask one or two questions, and then maybe a second round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3315.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll allow our candidate to give us a little summation, perhaps answer something that wasn't asked or perhaps clarify something that was asked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3322.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this evening, then afterwards, we'll have an opportunity to discuss other particulars after all the candidates have been interviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3383.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So anyway, our first candidate this evening is Christine Patterson.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3391.081s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Christine is currently at vocational school, the South Middlesex Vocational School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3397.363s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's been there for approximately seven years, previously at Blackstone Vocational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3403.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to ask Christine to come up and say hello to everybody and we'll introduce yourself and we can then begin the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3428.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Kirsten, you're here and obviously I'm glad you're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3433.361s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tell us a little bit about yourself, what you've done and why you believe you'd be a great candidate to be Medford's new Director of Administration and Finance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3497.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so we're going to go around the room and we'll take questions and we'll start off with our senior members, Paula Van de Kooten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3646.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, let's keep it moving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3648.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Robin Evans Carey Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3782.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Vice Chairperson of the School Committee, Erin DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4115.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ann Marie Cuno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4450.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have much time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4521.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4660.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ann Marie Cugno, second round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4879.662s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll go back to me and myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4884.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know you're good, but you have a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4888.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4889.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4889.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy, how about you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4978.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Erin DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5606.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've reached that point in the evening where you get a chance to sum it all up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5612.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tell us something that maybe you want us to know that we didn't ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5617.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe just give that final pitch as to why you need to be the Director of Finance and Administration for the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5706.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I'm pleased to present to you Michelle Shepard, CBA, who is currently in Pitchburgh as a City Assistant Treasurer, Elector, City of Pitchburgh.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5718.549s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michelle is licensed in the field as a School Business Administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5723.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Michelle, the way this works is that we give you an opportunity to tell us a little bit about yourself, we have your resume, and why you think you should be our new Director of Finance and Administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5736.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll then go around the room to committee members and they'll ask you a question or two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5740.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And at the end of it all, you get to fill in the blanks, maybe tell us a little bit of something that we didn't ask, or sum up some key point that you want us to take home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5749.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So without further ado, why don't you tell us a little bit about who you are, and why you're interested, and why you think you're going to be a great find for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5838.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't we begin by starting with Erin DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6027.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So why don't we go to Robert M. Iscari Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6143.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's go to Paulette Vandecourt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6355.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK, so now we'll go to Kathy Kretsch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6614.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anne Marie?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7089.771s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so any other questions anyone has right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7095.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so Michelle, tell us a little bit, something we didn't ask you or give us some reinforcement about something that you want us to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7107.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give us that extra boost as to why you should be our person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7256.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Diane Johnson is with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7260.597s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Diane is currently the director of, chief financial officer of the Arlington Financial Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7269.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let me introduce you to the people around the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7271.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Paulette Van der Kloot, Henry Cugno, Robert Emmett Skerry Jr., Erin DiBenedetto.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7279.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor Stephanie Burke, Diane Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent, Kathy Kreatz, Mia Mostone, and what's her name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7292.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly Nelson, Deputy Superintendent, and Pat Bielefe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7295.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7301.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What do you expect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7307.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right, so anyway, Diane, thank you for being patient with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7310.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We went a little bit longer than we thought initially, but that's what happens in public meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7316.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tell us a little bit about yourself, about your background, your qualifications, and why you believe you would be a great person for this job here in medicine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7463.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to begin by going around the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7464.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to start with Mia Mostow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7467.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been writing questions all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7518.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: More?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7519.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7520.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7521.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll go to Ann Marie Cugno.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7789.789s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, so we're gonna go now to Erin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8417.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8418.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Kathy Gretsch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8513.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=8787.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Are there other questions anyone would like to ask?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9092.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've reached that point of the evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9094.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's sum it all up with another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=9095.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've reached that point of the evening, Diane, where you get to tell us something we haven't asked you that you want us to know, or to sum it all up and tell us why you're the best person for this job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4953.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent, welcome tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4956.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4958.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was before you last week, and I went over the budget in detail with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4966.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You did ask for some additional information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4968.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe it was forwarded to you over the weekend, if not sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4972.984s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm not sure what specifically you want to talk about, but if there's something specific, I'd be happy to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4993.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as Director of Finance and Administration pointed out, the proposed budget was $54,333,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4997.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an increase over FY 2016 of $1.4 the overall projected<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5008.565s">[Roy Belson]</a>: appropriated budget represents a 2.6 increase from last year, and the budget is buttressed by 2.1 of generated revenue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5016.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When the generated revenue is included, the actual projected budgetary expense will be 56,443,392, or a 3.2% increase over FY 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5027.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Also, as we've indicated, various aid allocations and grants from federal, state, non-profit groups, corporate sources, and the like are factored in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5036.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are concerned that the state budget is under some duress right now, because there are funds that come to the school directly from the state, and it's hard to know what the conference committee is going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5047.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some funds that could be vulnerable, especially since the governor has indicated that the projected shortfall going forward is greater than was originally anticipated, by about $200,000 more than was previously anticipated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5066.463s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We provide sufficient resources to enable us to meet the requirements of state and federal mandates that are in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5073.467s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Undoubtedly, there are a number of contingencies that happen every year that we have to make adjustments for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5079.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fiscal 2016 saw the successful negotiations of virtually every contract in the school department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5086.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is one contract out there, but we believe that will close sometime over the next two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5091.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's with the Carpenters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5092.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are only three members of that particular group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5096.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But all the funding that we need is accounted for in that budget proposal and budget that was approved by the Medford School Committee on June 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5109.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working with the mayor, as you know, and you've asked for some of these things on capital planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5113.792s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked for a listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5114.793s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you a listing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5116.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I also gave you a short-term listing of things that we thought might happen sooner or would like to happen sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5122.415s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, it has to be factored into the total cities approach.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5126.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to capital planning, and we look forward to working with the mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5130.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about a number of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5132.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall enrollments in the schools remain pretty stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5135.937s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Class sizes are very, very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5138.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The actual distributions by school will vary somewhat as people come and go during the summer months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5146.202s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vocational enrollment is definitively up, and there are a number of new offerings that we think are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5153.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: terrific offerings, and our young people are flocking to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5157.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Minute Man allocation has been sharply reduced over the last several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5162.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three years ago it was a million dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5164.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's now down to about 400, and it will be less than that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5169.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do anticipate some increase in ELL students, students who don't speak English as a first language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5180.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have some retirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5182.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've indicated that some of that will come and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5184.263s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And when we gave you the budget, it was 16 known retirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5187.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a couple more that come in over the summer because people are talking to us, but I can't tell you who they are at this point because they haven't made up their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5197.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were approximately 11 faculty members when we gave you this budget originally who were not going to be rehired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5202.491s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we made some decisions to rehire at least two of those that were previously on the list to not be rehired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5208.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There may be a couple more that we bring back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5211.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes we put people on a list like that as to give us more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5214.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The state law requires that when we have a non-professional status teacher, we have to notify them by June 15th if we believe that we may not rehire them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5223.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not true for other kinds of positions, but it is true for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5227.441s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we sometimes put some extra people on that list just to be sure that we've covered the bases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5239.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Elementary supplies have increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5241.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All supplies across the district have increased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5243.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think I did tell you that Envision was in its last year of payment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5249.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's about $82,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5249.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And after that, we'll be able to take that amount and use it in other areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5256.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We did tell you a little bit about our desire not to ask parents to provide substantial amounts of supplies and materials that the school department believes we provide quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5268.287s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and that we should be able to cover their needs without asking parents to do much more than a handful of things that they would use at home for the youngster coming home, paper, pencils, pens, rulers, things of that type that might be necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5282.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The science budget included 10,000 funding for additional elementary science kits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5288.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Journey's English language program has already been paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5290.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The ELL budget has 6,000 more in it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5294.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's also additional $2,000 for translation services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5298.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've added 1.5 positions to that area to accommodate the incoming people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5304.307s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The special ed department will add an adjustment Councilor to that level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5307.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be 16 adjustment psychologists and four behavioral specialists going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5313.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we've added a fifth behaviorist as part of the discussions with the school committee in their last hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5320.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's also included in what I've sent to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5325.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've eliminated one administrative position, the clinical coordinator's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5331.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've added a librarian to the middle school, so each school will have access to a full-time librarian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5337.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not full-time, but they'll share a librarian plus some para help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5344.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've added a math coach to the elementary schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5347.746s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've added three full-time kindergarten aides to the Roberts Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5353.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that's the limit on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5357.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vocational school will be adding four teachers to support expanded programs, engineering, robotics, business technology, multimedia program, computer, and business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5367.721s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hospitality program is envisioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5369.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It may happen with some additional dollars that come from the outside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5374.163s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The vocational budget is $10,000 more for instructional supplies, an additional $23,000 to support needed equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5379.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they also get $65,000 of Perkins federal funds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5384.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that we think will be good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5385.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They'll also, as I indicate, save some money in the tuition to Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5418.009s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The department will also be doing some work with school computer science programs and share some teaching time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5429.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The social studies department maintains a strong textbook account of $20,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5432.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That will help them with their advanced placement European textbooks and with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5439.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: other books that are part of their overall program, including a global scholars program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5468.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That came from a decrease in the need to fund the Michigan model, which has already been purchased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5472.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the health education model that we use in conjunction with our substance abuse prevention program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5553.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not many in the Commonwealth at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5721.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We think we can reduce some of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5722.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We hope to be able to reduce some of that by using a smaller bus to take youngsters to Minuteman 1 and also to possibly use our new Transfinder route development system possibly to even consolidate and maybe even drop off a bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5738.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want to be careful before I say that because obviously I don't want the time to increase for youngsters and travel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5745.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Vocational transportation fund of Block 17 may see some reimbursement from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5749.819s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm wary about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5751.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's 1.7 million statewide for non-resident transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5756.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's probably a very ripe area to be cut in the state budget and conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5761.386s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We hope it doesn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5762.626s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Special education transportation is up 50,000 from last year, reflecting the cost of small vehicles.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5767.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And homeless transportation is also up 50,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5769.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was identified as an unfunded mandate originally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5773.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the state has not funded it at the level that it truly needs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5777.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there are more and more homeless families that we serve every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5782.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've talked to you about the public information officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5784.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe it's a valuable add to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5786.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that the position is well worth what we put into it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5790.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that we've already seen some significant payback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5794.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we believe we've provided for many of the priorities identified by our professionals in the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5801.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We all realize no budget provides for everything, and no budget does everything that everyone wants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5805.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A lot of things are aspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5807.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to thank my staff and the people that work with me for putting this together, because I believe they've done yeoman's work in making sure that the school budget is a good document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5818.049s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the school committee, I believe, put a lot of time in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5820.111s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've had several pre-budget hearings, as you know what we're talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5824.413s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They met right through the year, talking with department heads, getting their feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5828.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then they met in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5831.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: twice to go over their priorities and to make final decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5836.219s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Mr. President, I think that gives you a little bit to start with, and I'll be happy to take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5864.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6000.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know nothing about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6002.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's been done through the city's administration, I'll take the money obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6009.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the school committee does not know about it as far as I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6122.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can I ask just a point of clarification?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6126.409s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Listen, I wasn't part of the budget discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6128.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As far as I know, it's $54,333,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6128.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6129.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the budget the school committee approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6186.868s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The budget line that the school committee approved has not changed since the school committee approved it on the 20th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6191.87s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's $54,333,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6192.211s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if something has been added to it, I have not seen anything added to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6199.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Ann is telling me that at this point in time, that's the number in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6202.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the number in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6203.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what the school committee approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6205.567s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I know we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6206.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I know of no addition outside of the three kindergarten aides to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6213.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I indicated in the letter that I sent to you in response to your query that that increase within the lines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6221.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be taken from certain lines, it would be $23,775.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6226.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the cost of that particular item, but it's not adding or changing the bottom line.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6291.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anything else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10389.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, members of the council, I understand that Councilor Marks has legitimate concerns about security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10397.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the like, but I want to offer a few thoughts, and hopefully, you know, maybe it'll help us understand each other, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10406.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, let's see what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10408.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's see what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10410.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, during the day, we have intensive security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10414.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than most school systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10418.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have, and we, and you know, some of the events that happened this year obviously ramped up some of the things that we did, because people felt a need to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10426.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: when the majority of youngsters are there in the school, and they're in concentrated areas, and they need that kind of coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10437.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have a lot going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10439.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have cameras.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10440.093s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have monitors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10440.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have guards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10441.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have resource officers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10443.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have door locks in the systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10445.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we have ID systems now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10448.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We meet with CBJ every week to determine what's happening in the streets, so when it comes in Monday morning, we know what's going on, what happened over the weekend,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10457.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have constant contact with the police.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10460.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have constant contact with the DA's office, the courts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10464.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot going on that people don't see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10468.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We belong to NMLEC, which is a regional group that brings things in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10473.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But council raises the issue of what happens around 3.30 when things are over for the main part of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10482.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe, just maybe, it would be nice to have all kinds of people there, but you've got to ask a couple questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10488.693s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How functionally effective would it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10491.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not just cosmetic, how functionally effective would it be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10494.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm standing here right now, and there are probably a few people in this room who don't like me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10499.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if that's true, but I have the feeling that there's some people who don't really like me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10504.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My back is to the wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10505.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no police officer guarding this council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10508.701s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no police officer at churches and synagogues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10511.963s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's no police officer at the restaurants we go to, in the parks where the Little Leagues play.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10519.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Point of information, Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10520.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10521.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm trying to give a point of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10525.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I'm trying to give you an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10527.072s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm trying to point out to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10565.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not in the afternoon, not thousands in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10568.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, the parks where the kids play their sports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10572.24s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't see all kinds of people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10575.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, it would be nice to have all kinds of people around who are doing that officially.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10582.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you talk about all the things that we want in these budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10585.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You talk about all the things that we would like to do and all the repairs we'd like to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10590.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I personally think that putting people in these roles is not giving us functional value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10596.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can get the same return<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10598.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: from people who are crime watchers, if you will, people who can pick up their phone or use their cell and call 911 if necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10606.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think you need that kind of coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10609.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've talked about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10612.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm listening to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10613.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10614.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe there's something we can think about, but I don't think it's the kind of thing that we could do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10621.331s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with fidelity around the schools in the afternoons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10624.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't think that it's different than what we expect from our little leagues, from our youth programs, soccer programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10631.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're all over the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10633.781s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Random acts of violence happen anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10637.624s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So to think that the schools are more likely to have them in the afternoon than the parks where the kids play, or the churches where people go to, or the restaurants where people eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10649.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think that's real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10650.912s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so, it's an exchange.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10652.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, I'll think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10654.013s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe there's some things we can do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10655.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't think it's a just refusal to consider the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10662.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's well thought through at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10664.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But maybe you don't agree with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10666.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I think is really the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10668.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We just don't agree on the subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10787.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm standing here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10789.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is anyone protecting you right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10791.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is anyone protecting me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10792.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is anyone protecting the citizens of this community right now standing here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10795.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone could walk in and say anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10798.014s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone could walk in and do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10800.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we recognize we live in a society which has some violence to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10804.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We recognize we live in a society where there's a lot of random acts of terror and activity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10810.294s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you can't cover everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10812.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't cover everything realistically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10813.896s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And putting a couple of people in the place is not going to be a functional value to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10818.659s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can get the same return.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10820.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me finish the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10841.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We disagree on the functional value of that type of person in the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10847.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if you want to continue the discussion, maybe the school committee can take it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10850.903s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can have a discussion, but it's going to require some money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10853.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to require, what do you call it, an understanding of what they do and how they do it, and whether or not it's really going to give us value or whether or not it's cosmetic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10863.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm just raising that for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10864.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think that in the best of all worlds, we wouldn't have everything we wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10869.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've raised several things that we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10871.5s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want a lot of things that I couldn't put in this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10873.782s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are people that ask me for things that I couldn't give them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10876.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: okay, in this budget, or any budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10880.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been doing it for a few years, and I recognize that there are times when you just can't do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10885.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think that we are neglectful in this situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10889.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I do believe that when we cover the school day, we're doing what we need to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10894.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, okay, look, it's a discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10896.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I appreciate the fact you care, but I also hope you appreciate the fact that we've thought about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10902.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I haven't just dismissed it out of hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10904.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've thought about it, but I don't think it gives us functional value.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10909.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=10909.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President, if I could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11009.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. President.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11012.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to comment on something that keeps coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11016.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I've sat here and listened to everyone talk about the lack of communication, the lack of information, the lack of stuff that's going out to the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11024.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to tell you, that public information officer has put an awful lot of stuff on the street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11029.148s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's an awful lot of information in this community about the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11032.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: More information than you've ever had before, and people are telling me that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11036.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11037.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can disagree on that, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11039.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is, is that you talk about public information, they're getting it from the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11045.821s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're getting it from the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11049.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll see the budget soon as you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11051.906s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll go right up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11054.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: just like it has every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11056.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you want to change that, you just simply vote to have people put their proposed budgets up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11062.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11063.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you never did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=11065.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All you did was ask, what do you call it, to put the money up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=139.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And our members of the committee will call on our Deputy Superintendent to tell us about the Administrative Work Week, which will take place beginning on Wednesday of this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=148.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=379.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, as you know, for a period of time now, the GBL has diminished in its size as various members opted to go with different leagues in the area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=390.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That meant Medford, Somerville, Malden, and Everett<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=394.069s">[Roy Belson]</a>: had become the remaining members of the GBL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=398.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Scheduling and creating athletic opportunities for young people within the GBL becomes progressively difficult.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=405.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to find teams outside of our area, and every year it's a different situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=410.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It also deprives our youngsters of competing against other students in other communities that could take on sports that maybe the GBL members choose not to participate in at a particular time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=423.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So our athletic director is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=426.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are looking to merge with the NEC, the Northeast Conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=430.881s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of the schools in the Northeast Conference once belonged to us, like Revere, and Peabody, and places like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=437.705s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're looking to go to that at this point in time and see if we can't make sure that we have a robust league for our students to play in over the next several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=448.891s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It wouldn't start till the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=451.085s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have the fall to get used to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=452.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't affect the Medford-Malden football game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=456.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Simultaneously, I just want to mention while we're talking about this is that Jack Dempsey, our softball coach, was named the Boston Globe Coach of the Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=463.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Congratulations, Jack.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=466.118s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And several of our players, senior Ashley Eisner, girls softball, named the Boston Globe's, and Boston knows all scholastic girls softball team, girls softball, girls tennis team, and lacrosse, boys lacrosse are GBL champions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=480.094s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Those are some highlights from the sports side of things, and if you have any questions, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=485.697s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maloney and I can try to answer them for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=515.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, obviously, anytime we make a move of this type and change our affiliations, we would like your endorsement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=521.981s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm not sure that it does, because you basically allow us to play any team and, you know, in the area, as long as they're governed by the MIAA and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=531.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it certainly would be a good idea if you did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=540.01s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=540.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=541.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've been trying for an extended period of time to form a league.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=545.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, but very few, the middle six league would only take us and not Malden and Everett and then Cambridge bolted to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=553.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: another week and Waltham bolted to another week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=556.016s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So before you know it, we were down teams instead of having a robust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=560.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that was just, you know, dissipated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=797.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have provided to you a fee structure for community schools as you have requested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=805.18s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have previously approved the rules and regs for the rentals of facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=810.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are some<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=811.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: additional items here that were made to accommodate youth groups and also some community groups that might not have the resources necessary to access our facilities on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=824.255s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've tried to take into account the things that have been provided to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=829.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat Velie is here to talk about this particular issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=832.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Mr. Maloney is also here as the director of community schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=837.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm going to have Pat take you through the changes that we've made so that you can go over them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=842.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can decide if we're going to go forward with this particular schedule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2037.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2040.837s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the budget that comes next, that comes after this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2050.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, recently there's been some discussion about a succession plan, whether we would have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2057.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so in response to your request, we've put one together for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2063.127s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It comes in the two types of scenarios.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2065.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The first scenario is that if there was an untimely or unexpected vacancy created by either illness or some other dastardly act,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2076.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the superintendent is unable to perform his duties for whatever reason, then the deputy superintendent would become the interim superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2084.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The school committee would begin a search process for a permanent replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2089.167s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The deputy would serve until either the superintendent returned or a new leader was selected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2093.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current school system administration is an experienced team that can handle transition and maintain operations for an extended period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2101.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just go over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2101.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a deputy superintendent, an assistant superintendent, director of finance and administration,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2106.766s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a director of pupil services, director of buildings and grounds, as well as principals, assistant principals, department directors in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2113.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And each would be able to carry out their essential functions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2116.873s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that should there be an unexpected situation occur and that things happen to people and things go on, whether it be illness or something else, I think we have a very experienced team in place that could step up and run the school district for a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2130.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if the committee reached a point where they felt that they had to do something a little bit more permanent, then the next thing would kick in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2137.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was an announced vacancy, for example, the superintendent decided to retire, the committee decided not to rehire the superintendent or whatever the case may be, the Medford School Committee could retain the Massachusetts Association of School Committees as one example to conduct a search or a similar organization.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2160.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll give you a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2161.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A search by an organization costs generally somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2167.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a typical search for MASC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2171.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you went to what Lexington did, it cost them $35,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2173.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They hired a national firm, and they found three people from Massachusetts after they did their national search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2182.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think, you know, obviously MASC can, you know, can do a very good job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2186.144s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They do a lot of them around the country, and we can give you examples of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2189.385s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that's probably a preferred option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2191.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's the least expensive for an experienced organization that does it around the state and has many, many contacts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2199.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A comprehensive search process normally takes four to five months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2203.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't a full year process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2204.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, naturally, if you're not happy with the candidates, it could take a little bit longer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2208.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But generally, if things go according to normal plan, it's four to five months to complete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2214.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The time frame may vary depending on geographical location of your search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2217.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, if you want to bring people in from California or Montana or Hawaii, it may take a little longer to interview them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2223.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you're interested in bringing people from Massachusetts, New England area, or things like that, New York, Connecticut, you certainly could do this in that time frame.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2234.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Of course, a number of community focus groups that you would want to hold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2239.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people want to hold focus groups in different sections of the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2242.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people want to do it by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2244.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some people want to do it by topic, special ed, ELL.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2248.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can decide whatever approach you'd want to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2252.173s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can give you guidelines on how to do that if you chose to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2256.435s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The typical search process, five phases, and they're as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2259.917s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Phase one is a leadership profile development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2262.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It takes about a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2263.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You would sit and talk about, you know, what you expected in a leader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2267.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you would create, for the organization running the search for you, the kinds of information they would need to put up brochures and do advertisements and be part of the screening process, which would be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2279.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: coming on a little bit later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2280.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Phase two would be candidate recruitment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2282.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once that's decided, brochures would go out, advertisements would go out, and candidates would be recruited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2290.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then phase three would be candidate screening, also about a month's worth of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2295.548s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then phase four, community evaluation of candidate finalists, because they would be narrowed down to three, four, five people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2302.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you could do that generally in less than a month.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2304.735s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may want to take a little longer, but three weeks is generally a normal search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2309.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then phase five, the appointment and contract negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2312.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Give yourself a little bit of time to meet the person that you might want to hire, and then spend some time talking to that person about terms and conditions of their contract and what your expectations are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2323.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from time to time, an individual and a candidate decides at the last minute they don't want to be there, or the terms and conditions, so you might have to go back to candidate two, three, four, whatever you choose to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2337.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've given you the MASC detailed guidelines for each phase and the kinds of things they would ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2342.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can give you more, but I felt tonight this was a good enough start to get going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2346.259s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the recent Brookline search took four, it took four months and I attached that for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2351.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Brookline, uh, much more expansive than some places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2355.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the selection of an interim superintendent from Malden is scheduled for three months and change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2360.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, they're currently doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2361.645s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They started in May and they hope to have somebody aboard by July one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2365.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The fall river selection took a little better than three months, and that's a bigger community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2369.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I can give you other examples of, you know, search times, but I wanted to give you a few that you could look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2375.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've attached some information, some brochure-like information, and some other things that people have put out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2381.04s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, we can do more if you felt that was necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2386.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The process for community involvement can take many forms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2389.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can have a community survey online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2391.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can have a hard copy survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2393.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can have community forums like we've had in the past, or you can have categorical focus groups where you bring in, you know, different groups from a school or grade level, areas of interest, talk to the faculty, staff members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2408.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can mix and match these as you see fit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2412.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you review this at some point in time, you may want to give me guidance so that we can refine it and develop it into the next stage of readiness for you to go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2424.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you want to determine who's going to be on the screening teams internally, whether you're going to have the full committee and other people, or you're just going to use the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2433.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are some of the things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2435.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or you can combine any of the above.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2437.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A formal application form, I attached an example of that for your review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2442.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2443.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can ask different questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2445.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's up to you, but I think that's typical of what you would ask and what you would look for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2452.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, of course, the selection of a group such as MASC can greatly facilitate what goes on to enhance the possibilities of finding a good fit for Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2462.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And lastly, there'd be a transition process between the outgoing leadership and the incoming superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2467.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And every effort would be made by my administration to assist in that process to ensure that the individual had the benefit of knowing where things were and what our perspectives were based on our own experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2482.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the above report and attached information help allay any concerns that a succession plan is in place and a process can happen in a reasonable timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2490.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Happy to take any questions you might have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2491.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2729.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I can make a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2732.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, just simply this is that you've got some outlines here, so go down it and see whether you, what kind of, what kind of combinations you like, and then we'll call a committee of the whole or some point and you can decide, you know, if this happens, we want this type of focus group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2746.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like a survey online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2748.115s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like this, we'd like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2749.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you put it together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2750.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you flesh out the document based on what you would like to see and we'll give you guidance on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2755.839s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not a difficult thing to do, but remember this was the outline so that you can get started and then you can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2762.373s">[Roy Belson]</a>: flesh it out a little bit and say what I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2764.674s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, what do you want?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2766.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it will be different in different communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2768.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some communities will emphasize one thing, and some communities will want to emphasize something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2772.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we can get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2774.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure Glenn Kocher or Jim Harney or some of the other people that work for MASC would be happy to come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2780.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they're your best bargain, to be honest with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2782.143s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They do enough of them around the Commonwealth, so they've got lots of experience and lots of contacts and get along with MASS pretty well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2789.933s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you don't have to pay the fees for some national firm that, you know, we'll find somebody, uh, two communities over, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3004.412s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a standard procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3018.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as we do this virtually every year, because we don't meet as frequently if we meet at all during the summer, I send out all kinds of information to you at different points in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3028.279s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from June 21st, 2016,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3031.051s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Through our first meeting in September of 2016, I'm requesting the school committee grant authority to the superintendent and the school committee secretary for the following.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3039.254s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One, that the authority shall be granted to the secretary of the school committee to approve bills and payrolls through July and August, and that the school committee be kept informed of the bills and payrolls approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3048.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, that the administration be given permission to open bids in order to proceed on repair and maintenance work and other essential procurements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3055.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Notice to the school committee will be provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3058.125s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, that the superintendent be authorized to conduct the normal and necessary business of the school district throughout the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3063.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And four, that the superintendent keep the school committee apprised of any special situations or circumstances during the summer months or that are projected to occur at the opening of schools in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3115.566s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We were going to schedule one earlier because with the opening of school, we had talked about that once before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3183.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think we obviously can stay in touch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3186.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you see something and you want to call a meeting, you just need three members to call the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3191.232s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, three would three would allow for a meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3205.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I wouldn't schedule a date yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3207.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody's going to make summer plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3209.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, why don't we, if you agree that you want a summer meeting, we can agree to that and we'll get back to you and check everyone's vacation plans.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3215.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But from past experience, you set a date and everyone is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3220.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in different places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3221.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3222.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you want a summer meeting, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3224.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let me caucus everyone around and find out when people are available, and then we can get a date that we know people are going to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3433.733s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3444.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, just a couple of comments, if I may.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3449.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if people fully realize this, but a statistic rolled by my desk this past weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3456.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's kind of interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3459.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: About 49, 50 people were killed in the Orlando shooting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3462.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since that time, there have been 207 homicides by gun violence in this country since that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3471.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're isolated situations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3473.608s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's situations in which, you know, they're not getting the same coverage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3478.734s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Orlando is truly tragic, but so isn't the ongoing gun violence that exists in our country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3485.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a lot of it is based on mental health issues that people have, or just domestic disturbances, or drug deals, or other things like that that go on in society.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3494.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it often goes unnoticed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3498.47s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On an average day, based on the number of gun homicides in this country, 27 people die every day, on average, by guns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3508.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 27 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3509.79s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's horrific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3512.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Until we start dealing with mental health, until we start dealing with the availability of guns and things like that to individuals, we are not going to abate the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3523.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Terrorism is an issue and certainly to be dealt with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3527.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are other domestic and, let's say, personal issues that are every bit as tragic every day in our various communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3539.499s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other comment is most people who've been around for a long time knew Bob Sarabian.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3545.743s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bob was just a terrific guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3548.084s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I grew up on Governor's Ave in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3549.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bob lived on Hutchins Road, and the Sarabian brothers operated Carpathic Area for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3556.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: George was the oldest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3557.631s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bob was the second oldest, and Ron is still alive and still an active businessman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3563.155s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Bob was a very giving man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3564.876s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He worked very closely with John Hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3566.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you remember the name John Hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3568.604s">[Roy Belson]</a>: John Hand was the executive vice president of the Medford Cooperative Bank.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3572.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they were in arts festivals and all kinds of things that benefited the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3576.648s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Bob was a real contributor and someone that, you know, sometimes when a person hasn't been in the public light for a long time, new people in the community don't remember that individual because they weren't around when they were very active.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3591.055s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I thought it was important to at least tell you that Bob Sarabian was quite a player in this community and the Sarabian family as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3608.159s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, pursuant to my consultations with the Brooks faculty and staff and the leadership of the Brooks parent groups, as well as my consultation with you last meeting, I'm very pleased and privileged to announce that Suzanne Galussi, who is with us this evening, is the new principal of the Brooks Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3632.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Suzanne got her bachelor's degree from Framingham State, and then her master's in education from Wesley University.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3639.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She has 14 excellent years of teaching experience in the elementary schools in Medford, and four very successful years as assistant principal of the Brooks School, and her appointment will be effective July 1, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3651.982s">[Roy Belson]</a>: During the upcoming administrative week, we'll meet with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3654.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Galussi and other members of the administration to determine how we will select<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3660.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: her assistant principal so that Brooks has that in place for the opening of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3666.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Suzanne, the show's yours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3917.177s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3919.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At our meeting on the 15th, several items were identified by the committee as being important based on their conversations with members of the administration, faculty, and public with regard to the budget that was presented to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3935.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd like to address each of those items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3937.461s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you have the information in front of you and give you a little bit more information and answer any questions you have before we actually open the floor and take public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3947.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The math coach at the elementary level will be added and funded under Title I. Title I normally has done literacy work in recent years, but we were able to free up some dollars from that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3961.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a retirement in that field, and we're able to take some of the money from a higher end salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3967.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and also mix that with some reserve monies that come from Title I over the years that we carry over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3974.767s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, the actual salary will be based upon the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3981.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The coach might come from the inside, and then a replacement salary might go for that position the person would be taking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3990.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The emphasis would be primarily given to the Roberts, Columbus,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3996.67s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some at the McGlynn, at this point, we don't believe the Brooks is in much need of this particular position as the other schools that I've mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4007.853s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Secondly, a middle school librarian will be added to Block 029.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4013.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The salary will be based upon the teacher's contract, Bachelors 1, 48, 863.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4017.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The position will be shared between two schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4021.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The position will eliminate one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4023.844s">[Roy Belson]</a>: point five para position at 11 six nine Oh, which was a library aid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4028.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The differential will be $37,173 and will be funded through combined savings generated by leaves of absences granted in the vocational and science department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4038.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since our meeting, some people have opted for leaves of absence and we're able to recover money again from the higher salary to the lowest salary to give us the money to fund this position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4050.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Number three,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4051.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A behavior specialist for the Columbus School was added by promoting a current paraprofessional in the SPED budget, who has recently earned the credentials to fulfill this role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4061.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a non-unit position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4063.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The salary would be $40,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4064.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a behaviorist position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4068.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's similar to a BCBA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4069.6s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not certified, but Kathy can explain that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4072.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do have one already on board, and they serve the same function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4075.524s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They work closely with the BCBAs, and I think that will help a great deal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4081.742s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The current parasalary is $21,639, so therefore, the projected savings from the mid-year retirement of a senior SPED teacher that was identified to us, the senior SPED teacher will be replaced at a lower salary consistent with the teacher's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4097.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a new retirement that came in subsequent to our meeting on Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4104.43s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Four, three part-time kindergarten aides will be full-time at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4109.322s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Each will move from their current salary of $7,925 to $15,850.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4113.304s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This total increase will be $23,775.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4116.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Funding for this position will be taken from the revenue projections, which is listed in the budget book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4122.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I showed you where there was a revenue surplus that we put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4126.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And assignments will be based upon the contract provisions of the paraprofessional contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4132.676s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The kindergarten money at the legislature is still up in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4137.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's suspect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4139.194s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House would like it, and the Senate is not agreeing right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4144.537s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know what's happening to the conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4146.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4148.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everybody call your senator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4149.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4150.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would hope they would at least extend it for another year, because when they make a decision at the tail end of a year, you don't have time to make the adjustments that you would if you knew it at the beginning of the year, that you're moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4163.086s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's $150,000 in that grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4168.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that goes south, we'd have to find $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4170.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think I can do it with other things that happen and other revenue projections, but it's not the kind of thing that you want to do because that takes away other flexibilities for things that come up during the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4181.987s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this addresses the school that everyone felt was the most in need of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4187.068s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, the other three principals asked for other things and this would fulfill at least what the Roberts had asked for is as it's high priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4196.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Number five, the teacher specialist position at the McGlynn will be absorbed by existing personnel at that school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4201.584s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Principal Guarino reviewed the situation after the meeting and made the decision with me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4208.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She has an attached letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4209.208s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While the possibility exists for an internal shift of personnel, the principal opted to use existing faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4213.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would have sent somebody over there, but she wanted to use her own faculty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4219.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Number six, clerical assignments will be reviewed during the administrative week and decisions will be made regarding the realignment of personnel<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4225.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And naturally, we'll cover the most key positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4228.156s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are two clerical positions which we did not fill based on retirements of individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4234.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat and I and others will be looking at how we can move some people around in order to give coverage to those positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4241.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4244.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another piece that I handed you this evening was a piece with regard to the older musical instruments as surplus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4251.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We checked with the city again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4253.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Chapter 30B sets out procedures to ensure that we obtain good value when we dispose of supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4259.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to go through a procurement process, but we will begin that procurement process if you agree that we can do that based on our discussions last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4271.008s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will use that money in the music department, fine arts department, primarily for the band, but if there's some other use that the committee discerns is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4281.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: of higher priority, we'll certainly look at that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4283.924s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So these are the changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4286.926s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would ask that you agree with me or that you give me a substitute that you think someone should consider so that we can move forward with the public hearing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4388.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we can... Because it was...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4391.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's get the gift account set up and then we can come back and give you an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4575.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a behaviorist has got similar kinds of skill sets, but they're not as advanced in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4583.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this individual is going to be taking that test fairly soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4586.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Kathy Medaglio is here, and she can comment on the individual who we've identified within the SPED budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4689.731s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a clinical supervisor in special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4692.031s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Did you say that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4877.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4878.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll find out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4879.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Trotta knows, so he would be your supervisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4941.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let me try and answer that this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4945.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anytime I make a cut from something that I've got, most of the time, not always, there are a couple of things that I probably can reevaluate and say that wasn't a great move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4953.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But most of the time, it means that there's going to be something that's lost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4959.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this instance, the challenge to us is to take a look at the full fleet of clerical assistants and to reposition some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4968.516s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's probably highly likely that within the area of special education, Kathy's smiling out there, that, you know, there'll be some adjustment in that area and move away from something else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4981.82s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But every area, every area has got to be scrutinized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4985.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And from time to time, we see that maybe certain jobs can be consolidated, certain things can be shared, and we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4993.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we can't do that, we'll never ever be able to balance a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4997.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll always be add, add, add, and add later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4999.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we have to look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5000.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the challenge is to us not to ignore the good work that's done by the clerical staff, but to reposition it in such a way so that we can do the work with maybe a few less people from time to time or find that if we have to add a person, when we go back over during the summer, we'll come back and tell you we added a person and we'll find the money for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5023.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, but this is the beginning of a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5026.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5027.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And just as I came back this evening with these adjustments, I may come back with some more and say, we can do some more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5035.112s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or I might have to come back and say, you know, there's something that's happening to us at the state, the federal level, and we may have to pull back on something that we wanted to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5042.458s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the nature of budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5043.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the nature of process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5045.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh, but I hear you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5047.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's, it's no animus towards any particular type of position or any person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5051.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's really just simply a function of trying to find what the balances are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5114.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I answered you in my opening remarks in my budget delivery that I felt it was a strong hire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5120.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I felt that the individual brought a lot to the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5124.261s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 28 years of experience in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5126.843s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Significant knowledge of the networks of where people are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5130.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of coverage that we have received in the last several months is unreal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5135.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The amount of activity on the blog and on the webpage is huge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5140.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we've got 29 less kids going to charter schools right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5143.831s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got significantly more youngsters coming back from other areas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5149.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we've got a larger kindergarten enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5152.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think a lot of it has to do with people knowing something about our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5155.795s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The other night, I happened to listen to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5159.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Why I did that, I have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5161.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I was listening to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5164.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And while I was listening to the city council, I heard them talk about the lack of communication about things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5170.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They didn't know about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5171.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they didn't know about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5173.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the school department tells people about a lot of things going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5176.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe not everybody pays attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5178.139s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we have got a real strong public information process underway.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5184.621s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to keep it that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5185.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's in your best interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5187.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's your decision to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5190.618s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's my recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5191.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I wouldn't cut it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5193.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I don't think it's overpaid, because I think if you take a teacher today, for 10 months, they make, a senior teacher with 11 years experience makes almost $90,000 with a master's degree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5202.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't think it's an unreasonable salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5206.571s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave you this slip a short time ago about what people paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5212.236s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you bought a house in 1964, it was $13,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5213.377s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you bought a car, it was $3,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5214.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your starting salary for a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5220.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: $6,000, starting salary for any job is $6,000 in 64.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5224.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Things are different today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5226.583s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to be competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5228.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've got to have good people in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5230.024s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The knowledge this individual brings to the community, the knowledge, the work ethic the person brings to the community is invaluable and has my strong support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5238.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's your decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5417.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're going to share that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5421.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, there's one assistant position that will be dropped down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5426.505s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they'll have a full-time librarian and a part-time assistant, I mean, in each place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5434.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they can have a full-time librarian for both schools and also an assistant will go between the buildings when the other librarian is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5443.859s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The librarian will work both buildings, but the assistant will also work both buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5577.509s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know I'm not- Principal's given multiple options, and we could have adjusted a teaching schedule to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5582.83s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She chose not to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5670.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We added it at the half point of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5786.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it varies with regard to the type of class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5789.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A regular education class, it's in the contract with the Teachers Association.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5794.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5795.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's, you know, I'm not sure off the top of my head, but it's in the high 20s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5799.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5799.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then, you know, it would be because remember, this idea of really small class size, relatively new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5806.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5806.66s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There were years when, you know, class sizes were 28, 29, 30, and so on and so forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5811.875s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our class sizes are a lot lower than what people were used to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5814.856s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when these contracts were written, they were written with upper 20s as being the example for regular classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5821.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now in special ed, it depends on the type of class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5824.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If a special ed youngster is in a classroom that's self-contained, it's one to eight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5831.001s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it goes beyond that, there would be another pair required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5834.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's less than that, it may just simply be on the severity of the type of classroom it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5846.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's by regulation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6163.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6168.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6194.215s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We receive money from the Department of Public Health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6196.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a school health services grant that we have had for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6201.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This pays for part of the salary of one nurse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6204.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It doesn't pay the total salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6206.238s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It pays a portion of that salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6208.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So a portion of the salary is in the grant section, and a portion is in the health services section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6215.76s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6216.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We bill to both accounts, and we keep a record so that it can be audited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6266.162s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual is Molly Layden.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6268.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual has been and continues to be the person who gets the grant for the National Science Foundation for $1.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6274.968s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And some of her salary is offset<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6277.892s">[Roy Belson]</a>: by the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6278.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So once again, we take some grant money to pay a portion of the individual's salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6284.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We list it in the grant section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6286.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We also list her in the regular budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6290.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And her salary was approved through the negotiations with the Administrators Association in the last round of negotiations that we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6315.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So tri-tech is the organization that is a, let's say an offspring of Medford, Malden and Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6323.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6325.462s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was founded initially when the technology park was being developed, was being thought about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6333.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's continued for that time and has brought us millions of dollars through different grants over a period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6340.114s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Cindy Fadusha was the original executive director of that particular program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6344.798s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When she left to take a position with the Harvard Medical School and the physicians group over there, Molly Layden moved up into that position, and Molly Layden<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6355.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: runs that program as well as our program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6359.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the reality is that the program that she presented the other evening with regard to the youngsters developing applications at the middle school level was funded by the National Science Foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6370.84s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're allowed to charge a portion of her salary off to that foundation, to that grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6376.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the way we split it out so we can track it properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6380.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we audit it properly so that we can report to the feds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6393.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tritech is the recipient of the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6396.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result, Tritech exists as a holding company, if you will, to receive the grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6403.203s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is the grant that comes in through Tritech, through that 501c3, which allows us to then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6409.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: rebuild it to this with the University of Lowell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6417.581s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, because her portion of her salary, the part that she does for the grant, is paid for by the National Science Foundation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6423.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rest of it is work she does for us directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6436.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a function.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6437.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a function of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6439.045s">[Roy Belson]</a>: division of funding, not a function of two positions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6443.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's a projects director, and the funding source is just like the nurse's position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6447.729s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It comes from two different sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6449.61s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6450.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just paid for differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6452.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If we didn't do that, we would be picking up the tab for lots of grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6455.533s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we use as much offset as we can, and we're allowed to charge to both the federal and the state, in some cases, and this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6464.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same thing would be true of kindergarten aids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6466.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, which we just did because some of it's going to come from the state and some of it's going to come from us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6471.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a normal procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6474.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's one position, but it's a normal procedure funded with two sources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6484.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Which one is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6489.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let me take a look and I'll be a little bit more tuned to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6496.015s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Akira Kamiya is the person who is the primary director and runner of the National Science Foundation grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6507.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The grant comes to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6508.878s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He is located in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6510.918s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's his salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6512.438s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's paid to us by the grant through the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6516.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're our partner in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6518.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a direct salary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6520.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he works for us and the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6524.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if I... It's a million two over three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6528.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And those funds are allocated to these two people's salary and then... These two people's salaries and stipends to teachers working with students for equipment, materials, software, and give you a whole breakdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6541.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you go to the grants breakdown on the early part of the book, you'll see what's actually allocated to that grant and how it's broken down on a yearly basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6552.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you go to the front of the book in the section that's given to grants, you will see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6561.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Here it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6561.78s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's page, I don't have a page number on it, but I'll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6566.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Can you see it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6569.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Federal grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6577.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6585.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6585.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6592.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll provide it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6641.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6642.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the last two months, we have given you every document on every outside community schools and all these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6649.724s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can give it to you at the budget time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6651.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You asked for it earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6755.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to say it very clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6757.466s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6757.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make it very clear to everyone here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6760.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A report asked by an individual member is not a report that superintendent responds to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6766.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A report voted by the school committee is a report that the superintendent will respond to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6770.802s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I cannot and my staff cannot keep doing individual reports every time somebody wants something different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6777.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It takes a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6778.389s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat worked overtime and overtime to get those reports to you at that point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6783.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think it's disingenuous, quite frankly, to keep asking for the same thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6787.429s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want it at budget time next year, you can have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6790.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The committee voted to get it quarterly, we'll do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6792.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But let's not keep creating these kinds of report situations, because all it does is take us off what we're trying to do for the education of the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6889.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing you need to keep in mind is just what we're talking about state and federal grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6893.205s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't have the allocations yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6895.627s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I can't tell you what that account is going to look like going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6898.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can only tell you what it's been in a given year because the state budget isn't even approved yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6904.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the federal budget won't get delivered to us until the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6908.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And all that stuff has something to do with the way we allocate money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6912.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have to use projections all year long to see what's coming in and to balance one account off against the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6918.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, yes, we can give you projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6920.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, we can give you, you know, revolving accounts at a point in time, as a snapshot in time, like the end of the third quarter going into budget, which would be typical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6929.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But to give you a projection, what's going to be true in August are going to be true in September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6933.964s">[Roy Belson]</a>: is all speculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7011.657s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, we put them in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7033.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are three additional full-time AIDS at the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7037.378s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7040.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Everything else stays in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7050.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this point in time, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7053.123s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7054.025s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7193.158s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To approve the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7209.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make another statement about something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7212.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tomorrow night, I go to the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7216.3s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is the school committee budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7219.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I expect that the school committee supports its own budget because when I go to that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7226.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: council, I don't want to go in there and find that the budget that the school committee voted is not approved and not supported by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7240.066s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make that very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7241.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's very strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7242.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In my opinion, you vote as a committee, you stand as a committee, the superintendent represents you as a committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7882.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Madam Mayor, can I just want to say one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7886.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My comment was not that people can't vote against the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7892.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Majority rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7893.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's 5-2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7894.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7896.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7897.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been in enough meetings in the course of my career to know that they don't always get a unanimous vote for things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7903.812s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7905.694s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The issue I raised is when I go to the council tomorrow night, I want the committee to honor the fact that the committee voted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7915.182s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I said that before, when I was talking about reports, I don't want to go to the council and find that individual members go there and argue against the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7923.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what I'm saying, because the budget is what this committee voted up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7930.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're a committee, you're not individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7931.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've been told many times that as an individual you have no authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7936.407s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's only when you're in session and as a group that you have authority to act on behalf of the city and the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7942.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so all I'm trying to do is make it clear that I don't want to go in there with a divided camp tomorrow night and find that people will argue against me from my own committee because you voted this budget by majority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7958.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you could have voted the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7959.901s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or you could have voted for anything else you wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7962.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you voted it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7964.544s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Up or down, whether you're on the majority side or the minority side, it is the school committee budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7970.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's what the superintendent will represent tomorrow night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7973.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if I'm asked about other people's opinions, I will say the school committee voted this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7979.614s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7980.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's why I said what I said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7982.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't have a problem with dissent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7983.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: People want to dissent, that's business.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7985.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=684.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our Director of Mathematics and Science to come up and introduce the robotics team and their successful competition recently, which put them into a very favorable company in New England Regional Robotics Tournament.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=704.997s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Carolyn Joy is going to come up and we have some presentations for them as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2789.51s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I could ask the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2791.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've met with DSAC, and you know, we've worked with them before, and we'll continue to work with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2795.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are, you know, different assistances they can provide at different times, and it really depends on, you know, what we identify as being most significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2805.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As Melanie points out, there's a set-aside in the IDA funds that, you know, will be moved into that area, and also DSAC has some funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2813.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'll take a look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2815.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think that one of the things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2818.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we probably should do is, since Kathy can't be here tonight, and Kathy had some additional things she wanted to say, is why don't we schedule a session in the Committee of the Whole sometime before the year's out, and we can have a good give and take on where we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2847.576s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we'll have a, you know, obviously there's a lot of things going on as, as Melanie points out, the early childhood rate is way up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2853.598s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you combine the partial with the full inclusion, the rate is that much more substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2858.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the question is, how do we get it more full inclusion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3983.764s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The pay structure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3988.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll work that in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3990.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just, you know, I was hoping that we'd have something to you before the next school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4727.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4729.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you know, sometimes you have a policy and not everybody implements it the same way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4734.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4736.573s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was a discussion we had at a curriculum subcommittee not that long ago, and I think you attended this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4743.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, you were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4744.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we had that discussion at that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4746.948s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, we went back out to the buildings and we told them that policy is our policy and follow it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4753.69s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that there are some teachers who feel like, you know, they're hamstrung when a youngster is misbehaving or work is not coming in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4761.032s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they misuse that policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4763.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to stop it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4765.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't want them to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4766.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The whole issue of recess is not a new topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4769.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've talked about it many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4772.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're hamstrung a little bit by time and learning requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4774.852s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Medford school day is not as long as some other places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4779.074s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we need to meet that 900-hour requirement from the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4784.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And recess doesn't count.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4786.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's something that, you know, we're up against the wall on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4789.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are other ways to promote exercise, and there are other ways to do things that perhaps we can look into, and we certainly will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4797.474s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And maybe there are ways that active learning can take place when youngsters are moving around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4802.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a book out not that long ago called Spark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4805.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you've seen it, which youngsters are up and moving while they're learning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4810.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's a good way to get some exercise in as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4812.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But recess is an important topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4815.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No one wants to deny that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4817.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are some issues that we have to sort through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4819.181s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we do not want our faculty to use it as a punishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4824.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had the same issue years ago in writing, where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4827.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some faculty members assign writing as a punishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4831.2s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we said we don't want kids to think of writing as a punishment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4833.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We want people to think of writing as something you enjoy doing and like to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4838.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to work at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4840.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We certainly need to have a little more discussion on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4844.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll take, obviously, the input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4848.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let's see if we can't, during our administrative meetings, come up with something that might further the issue that Mrs. Kline's raising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4896.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, we certainly have it on the web page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4898.551s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll just make it more prominent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4900.472s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll, once again, reinforce it with our principals during the administrative meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4905.776s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will take place at the close of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4908.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll make it more of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4911.543s">[Roy Belson]</a>: definitive priority to people that's not going to be taken lightly if people abuse that policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4918.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's as much as we can do with regard to the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4921.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, with regard to other measures, that's a whole discussion unto itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4926.09s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We need to think about what we can do about that given the time and learning constraints and all the other things that we have to meet with regard to state requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4940.289s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've said that many, many times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4941.809s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll say it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4947.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It is in the handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4953.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll put it out again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5267.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Superintendent members of the committee, um, the Medford public schools has been awarded a $15,000 grant from the Massachusetts department of public health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5276.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us this evening is our supervisor of health services, Tony Vento, who can come up and explain the grant and explain what we're going to do with it and why we want to implement it next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5544.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good afternoon members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5546.55s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor proposed a 2017 budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5550.431s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House and the Senate then passed their versions and the budget now is in conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5556.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The conference committee has to reconcile the legislative differences between the two chambers, and when the conference committee reports out, and generally they'll take a good part of this month to do it, there'll be an up and down vote in each chamber.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5570.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If passed by both chambers, they can't make modifications once it comes out of conference committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5576.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will go to the governor, and he'll certainly veto a few line items based on his preferences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5581.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will then go back to the legislature for possible veto overrides, which is typical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5586.677s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a final version will then be sent to the governor for enactment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5590.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This process probably won't be completed until towards the end of June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5594.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You need to be realistic about how that takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5597.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a typical process in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5600.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It usually doesn't happen any sooner than the last week in June, if that at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5606.147s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So negotiations begin amid uncertainty over the 2016 revenues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5613.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, when I wrote this report, there was $260 million behind projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5617.52s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As of the other day, that projection went up to $311 million behind projections.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5623.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, Kristen Lepore, who's the Secretary of Administration and Finance, has indicated that they could handle that at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5629.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it does dampen the kind of thinking that goes on in the legislative chambers, because they're saying to themselves, well, if we're $311 million behind now, what will we be in June?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5639.437s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does that mean for carryover money into fiscal 17?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5642.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we just don't know how that's going to play out just yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5647.42s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall budget levels filed so far as follows.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5650.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor is at $39,553,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5650.921s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The House is at $39,539,000 below the governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5652.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the Senate is at $39,558,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5654.003s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the Senate's usually higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5655.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And generally, it comes in somewhere between the House and the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5666.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The overall increase is about 3.59%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5667.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate is the highest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5670.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: According to the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, the original projection rate for revenue was going to be 4.3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5677.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, right now through April, it's only 1.9%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5681.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's quite a gap in revenue that the state is expecting to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5687.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Overall, the House and the Senate provide similar support for K-12 education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5693.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there are differences among the 30 line items that need to be reconciled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5698.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm going to give you some representative differences because I think they do affect us as we prepare our budget and as we go forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5706.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one that I know you're all interested in, the house appropriation for kindergarten is $18.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5712.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's level funding from this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5715.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate is, that's a mistake, the Senate is at $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5720.486s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5721.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate is at $2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5723.996s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any reduction in this level will affect direct funding coming to Medford for kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5728.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This could be as much as $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5732.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If the Senate level carries or something lower than what we're getting, we could lose as much as $150,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5738.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5740.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Charter school funding is still well below the formula entitlement offset local costs for both branches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5746.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate is 5 million higher than the House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5749.11s">[Roy Belson]</a>: but neither really addresses the actual gap which could approach $50 million in underfunded entitlement dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5756.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Medford is projected, based on the early returns, to have less students in charters, but we could end up paying more in the current year, because that's the way the funding works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5766.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if the reimbursement goes down, that's a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5770.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Non-resident pupil transportation would be funded at $1.8 million by the Senate, which is $1.5 million more than the House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5778.169s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The funding line helps to offset the cost of the Minuteman bus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5781.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we're working on a less expensive cost for that particular vehicle because we have less youngsters going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5787.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We might be able to use a smaller vehicle and pay less for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5789.914s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the meantime, we would like to get that reimbursement because that obviously helps to offset the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5796.416s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate version puts $350,000 into a new line item that would support the development of alternative assessments of student performance beyond test scores.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5805.02s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's aspirational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5806.502s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know that we're going to see much from that, but it's an interesting proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5809.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate has used the budget process, if you will, to legislate policy issues, which the House has not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5816.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a real tricky slope because that means the Senate has to convince the House that it should be legislating policy through budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5822.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The governor has eschewed that at this particular point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5825.527s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's see what happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5827.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Senate version of the SPED circuit breaker is about $5 million more than the House and approximately $10 million more than the Governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5833.797s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This funding line offsets extraordinary special ed costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5837.479s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're projecting that we need somewhere around $283 million in the state to offset the cost to get to 75% reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5846.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's worth somewhere in the vicinity of $1.45 to $1.5 million to us every year as it's currently coming to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5856.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If that goes down, that's money we have to find in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5859.813s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We don't think it's going to go down, we just don't know if it's going to meet the 75% because every year more and more youngsters require care, costs of these placements may go up, and the gap could increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5871.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the main differences affecting Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5874.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Both the House and the Senate provided $55 per pupil minimum additional aid to schools under Chapter 70.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5880.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is $35 per pupil higher than the governor's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5883.833s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's $30 per pupil higher than last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5886.736s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This overall funding goes in directly into the city treasury and is used, obviously, for a number of reasons that the city needs to cover its expenses, including health care, pensions, and other matters that affect schools, but may not be something that you see on a regular basis in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5902.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Homeless transportation is level funded from FY 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5905.707s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is well below the need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5909.109s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pat and I are projecting right now that we could have $140,000 in costs next year based on past experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5918.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're not getting anywhere near that in reimbursement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5922.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that was supposedly an unfunded mandate that the state auditor said would be funded, but it hasn't met its expectations at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5930.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we call the legislators up on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5932.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was up the state house today for some time and spoke to some of our people again, but quite frankly, you know, it's hard to know what's happening in the conference committee until they really get serious and what the trade offs are going to be, because there's so many line items in the state budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5947.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If somebody gets one thing, they may give away in something else, but they know what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5952.212s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They certainly know what we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5954.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, uh, we certainly have,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5956.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the support of other school districts who have the same needs as we do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5960.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's an update so far on the state budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5962.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It certainly affects how we plan our budget because we won't know some of these answers when our budget comes up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5970.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it may be that we have to defer making certain decisions until we know what the actual state funding will be for certain items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5977.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll keep you posted and we'll provide some additional information if something breaks to us in the next few days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6001.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our Director of Finance and Administration, Pat Feely, to bring you up to date on our finances as we approach the end of the fiscal year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6347.785s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do that at the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6349.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're a single appropriation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6351.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as opposed to the council, which has individual line items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6359.586s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, we always give you that at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6362.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And once everything's reconciled, but it takes a while for it to reconcile because things come in during the summer, they're encumbered, they're held over until they're actually paid utility bills, things of that type.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6372.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So until we actually see the actual numbers, you don't want to make a million changes just simply on the fly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6402.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The rate structure, we're going to provide to you probably by the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6406.91s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, our recommended rate structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6409.327s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's being worked on right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6433.577s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing I'd say is that let us concentrate on budget right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6437.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we've got a number of things we've got to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6439.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a serious period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6441.658s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to try to get tied up with too many things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6444.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't mean to put anybody off, but this is the most important thing you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6449.204s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if I have to be running other meetings and going here and doing side bets, I'm not giving you my full attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6455.808s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's the close of school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6456.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6457.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's hiring of teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6458.53s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's things that have to go on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6460.952s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we'll get you the material, but let's not try and squeeze everything in because you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6466.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You make it more difficult to concentrate on the things that really will make a difference for you going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6472.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6473.352s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not pulling anything back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6474.773s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You always get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6475.613s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the issue is, you know, timing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6478.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it will bring you something by we have a meeting on the 20th, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6481.718s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll have stuff well in advance of that to look at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6483.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may not need a subcommittee because we'll explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6486.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may be able to just look at it and say, yeah, that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6710.696s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6711.356s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So last Friday, pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6714.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on last Friday, the governor signed the public records bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6720.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that the legislature finally put together over the last several months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6725.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not going to go through the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6727.026s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6728.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Obviously, we need to go through it more carefully, but there are new enforcement procedures in this, and there are new requirements under the public records law, which means that we've got to be that much more attuned to when people make certain requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6744.079s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously, you know, there is a need to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6750.258s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to rethink electronic records versus paper records, who's the custodian of these things, and what constitutes a public record versus what constitutes something that's exempt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6761.364s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are multiple exemptions from the public records law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6765.687s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Secretary of State has yet, obviously just got passed, to issue regulations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6771.21s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When he issues those regulations, that will be another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6774.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: step forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6775.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But this is scheduled to go into effect on January of 2017.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6779.23s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So over the next several months, we'll be watching very closely to see what the regulatory requirements are and how that fleshes out the requirements of the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6789.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But please read it, go over it, and we'll pay attention to it as well and keep you informed so that if these matters come up, we can handle them appropriately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6799.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would say one thing that you've got to be aware of, your email is a public record.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6805.86s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Your email is a public record, so if you say something you don't want to say in your email, it could be discovered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6813.062s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you need to think about that a little bit because sometimes, you know, you say something in a sort of out there way and you don't really want to broadcast that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6850.367s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's set by law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6851.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's set now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6927.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6927.411s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6929.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you previously had reported, Kevin Andrews is leaving to take a position as principal of the Nahant Elementary School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6939.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So on Wednesday, June 1st, I met with the faculty, along with Diane Caldwell, over at the Brooks, and then I met with the parent leadership team to hear their viewpoints on a succession plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6953.978s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Both meetings were very informative, but the conclusions were very identical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6958.133s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's virtually unanimous consensus to appoint an internal person to the position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6962.816s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a strong desire for continuity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6965.097s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's a significant confidence in the current assistant principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6968.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The superintendent concurs with that expression of support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6971.942s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So unless the school committee really wants to go through a process that's different, I really don't want to run a pony show for anybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6979.106s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't want to bring people in and pretend that we're having real interviews when I really believe that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6986.732s">[Roy Belson]</a>: it could very well be something that we'll have a known conclusion before we even get started.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6992.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Naturally, I'll speak to the unions about posting issues, but I would like to obviously, um, know that let allow the Brooks community to know the result before they go home, uh, the summer and also to allow for planning to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7006.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it also will inform the budget process as well, because if I make moves internally, uh, that has some cost savings associated with it, which I think is a distinct advantage to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7016.46s">[Roy Belson]</a>: given this year's budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7017.841s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'm bringing it to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7020.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want to get some feedback from you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7022.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And obviously someone wants to speak on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7023.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd be happy to hear what people have to say, but that's my thinking on it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7078.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll appoint an assistant principal afterwards, but one step at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7089.925s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we'll first look internally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7091.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reason we look internally is because we'd like to give our people opportunity, one, but two, is also a distinct budget advantage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7098.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If I have a senior member of the faculty who is qualified to be an assistant principal, it certainly helps to replace that person with a lower salary and recapture some budget funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7108.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a couple of advantages to going internally, but if that didn't come to pass and it wasn't something that worked out, then we would do what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7119.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7122.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're working on a solution there too and I really don't want to speak to that right now because I have to talk to Paul DeLeva in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7131.195s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But again, I'm very budget conscious right now and I'm looking internally as much as I can because obviously anything I can save allows you to have a little bit more in other areas that you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7142.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I might have some interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7197.908s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7199.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll take it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7254.796s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7261.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, I'd make it permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7262.871s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd make it permanent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7263.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd give the person the, you know, I would want that person to have the authority level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7268.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I wouldn't want someone to think, well, you know, this is maybe, you know, something that could change rapidly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7274.298s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, I want that person to have the authority level and be able to move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7357.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: West Foote was the foreman carpenter of the public schools for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7363.525s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And West was a very gentle soul, big man, very strong and very, you know, impressive kind of guy, very quiet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7373.309s">[Roy Belson]</a>: His wife Connie was one of the key people in the payroll office, and the two of them, you know, would see each other because they were basically both part of the central office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7382.684s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Wes was very, very skilled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7384.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You didn't have to, you know, explain to Wes how to make something happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7387.765s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know how to make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7389.366s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the Foote family was very active in the community for many, many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7392.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: His daughter, Linda, and daughter-in-law, Linda, and his son, Wes, Jr.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7398.368s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So very close to them, very good people, you know, and 95 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7404.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 95 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7405.811s">[Roy Belson]</a>: God bless him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7406.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He was a great player, and I can still see Wes coming through the corridor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7411.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: looking with Ernie Demon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7412.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know if you remember Ernie Demon at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7415.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ernie Demon, the two of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7416.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Ernie being the character in the crowd and Wes being the straight shooter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7421.301s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it was really kind of funny because Ernie would say something and Wes would say, oh, Ernie, stop that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7426.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But really good, really highly skilled people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7429.985s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they could do a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7431.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Back then, we had several carpenters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7435.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they really did some really nice things in school to keep them up and running.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7439.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And very fond memories of Wes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7441.19s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Good guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=48.121s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=52.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight we're distinctly privileged and honored to have with us the Medford Middle School String Ensemble, which was founded in 2009 by Medford teacher Sophia Chang to encourage the development of musical excellence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=67.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Miss Chang is serving her 13th year as orchestra director at McGlynn Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=73.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Since 2011, the ensemble has received six consecutive gold medals at the Concert Festival Conference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=82.119s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The string ensemble performed at Boston Symphony Hall and Mechanics Hall in Worcester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=88.002s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of her former students continue to pursue musicianship at the Tufts Youth Philharmonic, the NEC Youth Orchestra, the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, and among others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=100.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mrs. Chang is committed to foster broader appreciation for classical music to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=106.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Tonight, we are privileged to hear them perform at least two selections, Cakewalk from Serenade for String Orchestra by Norman Leiden, and Lullaby by William Huffeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=117.271s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, let's welcome our middle school orchestra.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1937.988s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just be in front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4183.557s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4186.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4188.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've been here 21 years now as superintendent, 48 years as a public educator in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4196.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I grew up in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4197.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4198.85s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to the Forest Park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4200.95s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to the Roberts Junior High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4202.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I went to Medford High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4205.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is my community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4208.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I care about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4209.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as I've said before, I never intend or would never intend to make a decision that would leave my community<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4218.962s">[Roy Belson]</a>: in the lurch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4221.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, having said that, we have had a process of evaluation and decision-making that has gone back well before my term as superintendent, and it's always been transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4235.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My self-evaluation will come to the committee this week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4239.346s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4240.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You'll have more than two weeks to go over it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4243.266s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's a pretty substantial period of time to look at the document, which takes me time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4248.369s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to produce and review given all the other responsibilities that we have in the school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4256.052s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The process will be in public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4258.293s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It always is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4260.274s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Open session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4260.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not an executive session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4262.375s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not away from anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4265.336s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's open and every committee member has an opportunity to say what they feel and make whatever ratings they want to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4274.28s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So far they've been good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4276.199s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sure that there may be some things that people would like to see me do better, or the school system do better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4283.482s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But clearly, it's been an open process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4286.483s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as you can tell, people come to the rail all the time and make statements, give their opinions, come into meetings, some of them in support, and some of them critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4300.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's a balancing act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4301.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Wherever we are, that's what takes place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4306.585s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What does concern me is this, and I say this in a very sincere way, and that's simply this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4315.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Whether I stay or go, when I go, if an outside individual is going to consider the Medford Public Schools as his or her home, as superintendent, they are going to evaluate the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4331.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if they feel the environment is hostile, they're not coming here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4336.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're not coming here because it's a tough enough job not to be in a situation where people are divided and split along many issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4349.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's our responsibility to have a decent dialogue, to make an appropriate decision, but to keep it intelligent and to keep it<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4362.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: welcoming, so that when someone does consider applying for the Medford Public Schools, they say, I want to go there, because that's a good place to be a superintendent of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4374.054s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The people support the administration, they support their school committee, and there's mutual respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4381.319s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so that's really what we've got to strive for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4383.26s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A decision will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4387.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Decision will happen in public session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4389.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Decision will happen after a lot of consultation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4392.698s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And a lot of the things that we have to decide are based on, am I a person at this point in time able to bring forward our agenda in an intelligent way?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4402.682s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or is someone else maybe better positioned to do that at this point in time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4407.404s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4409.405s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it's about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4410.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So let's have our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4414.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's respect each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4416.893s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's continue to work together, and let's make a decision in a timely way on behalf of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4424.434s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, superintendent searches vary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4427.455s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Many of them are done in a lot shorter time than a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4430.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if that's the community's wish, then that's something we'd go forward with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4438.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I've observed a lot of searches over the years, and people call me all the time because I've been around for a long time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4445.475s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that it's important we go through our process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4450.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also informative to go through the process, because the things I will bring to you in the self-evaluation will remind you of things you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4458.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Even when I'm writing up the evaluation myself, I'm saying to myself, oh, I forgot we did this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4462.98s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, I forgot this actually happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4464.761s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Oh, this, yes, was a concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4466.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, we dealt with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4467.922s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a process of re-educating ourselves about all the things that are going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4471.966s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also a message that we send to our administration, faculty, and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4478.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that we do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4481.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important that we have the right kind of discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4484.754s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we not create a leverage situation where decisions are made on the fly, or decisions are made without proper dialogue and discussion and process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4496.481s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm very confident that you will do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4499.183s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm very confident that we will have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4502.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a good discussion and that a proper appropriate decision will be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4507.241s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So thank you for your ongoing support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4513.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you for your interest in perhaps making sure the community has a proper transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4518.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at the same time, let's make sure we do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4521.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so you will get my self evaluation at the end of the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4525.639s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And by the way, it's important that people respect the fact that you're the elected members of this community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4531.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have a right to look at this stuff before the rest of the world comments on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4535.128s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You work with me all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4538.391s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And conversely, I believe I have a right to make sure that the people who work with me all the time get the first pass at commenting on what goes on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4550.077s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think we're in a good place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4551.759s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it will go well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4554.042s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think people will be pleased that a good transparent process has taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4560.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we all want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5261.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Prior or by?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7523.005s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, and this is something that was misunderstood, and I heard this at a council meeting, that this is not the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7529.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: These are guidelines to the procurement office to develop an RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7535.689s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they need to flesh out the specifics of security or other things, because if we get too tight right now, in their process, they may not be able to put something together that is appropriate for a vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7550.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you set up a security plan that's around the clock or something like that, they may say that's prohibitive, no one's going to bid on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7556.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We've got to get something from procurement, let them check with other people as to what's likely to go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7562.828s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The same thing is true of other elements of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7565.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is guidance to the procurement officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7568.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, the procurement is going to come back to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7571.725s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to see the actual document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7573.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is really guidance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7575.448s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let the procurement officer actually spell out a little title and you'll be better off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7579.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7634.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7635.235s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just one more thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7636.095s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, there are a lot of stories and comments being made outside of us that sometimes mislead the public.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7642.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I want to make sure we clarify, just as we talked about, this was not the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7646.623s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was the guidelines for the development of an RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7649.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, the second piece is that there was some comment at a council meeting that dealt with the cleaning of the fields, that no deep cleaning had taken place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7658.745s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7660.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have the invoices.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7661.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We actually have the procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7662.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we actually have the details that they did a deep cleaning on a regular basis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7668.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I want to make that clear that, you know, some people say things and, you know, they may think it's true, but we have backup information, which I can provide to you at a subsequent time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7679.192s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which shows that a deep cleaning was actually done, and the process and procedures spelled out as to what a deep cleaning actually is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7686.594s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So just for your information, in case you're asked, we've been doing deep cleanings because it was associated that if we didn't do deep cleanings, the longevity of the field would be compromised.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7696.616s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We do deep cleanings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7921.082s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What page are we talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8153.342s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you remember that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8153.882s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, just the one item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8155.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's wrap it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8187.308s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it, you know, is it different?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8188.709s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, basically, we're losing... Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9246.609s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam members of the committee, Dr. Heidi Riccio is with us this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9250.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's distributed some additional materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9252.452s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's a lot of exciting things going on in our vocational school, and she's here to tell you about some of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10300.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call upon our guidance director, Amelia Jensen, to tell us about the guidance department.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11209.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just want to mention while Amelia brings that up is Dr. Monaco is going to be at the high school on the 24th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11217.27s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you have time and you want to see him in the science labs talking with the kids and so on and so forth, we can thank him for the acceptances as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11226.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because maybe next year we'll go for 10.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11352.45s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Fine Arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12386.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor, members of the committee, Molly Waden is with us tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12391.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Molly headed up this project and filed it with UMass Lowell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12397.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this project is really an advanced project for a school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12401.788s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a $1.2 million grant, which we share with UMass Lowell and Everett.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12408.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But the work was done here with MOLLE and MOLLE, UMass MOLLE.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12414.887s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's a program where youngsters have really gone to the next stage of computer development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12420.209s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Instead of just doing the routine searches and things like that, they're actually developing the applications that people buy and developing new engineering techniques.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12429.671s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The way we've got to look at the future is that when we talk about science education and the like, it's not just learning the facts or the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12436.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now it's engineering solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12439.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this is a major step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12441.531s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And for our middle school youngsters to do this is an incredible step forward in computer science education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12448.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's to be a model.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12450.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12450.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Molly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12984.695s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're going to call on our deputy superintendent to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12987.496s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's almost summertime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13259.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, you have a very extensive report here dealing with community schools, not only with information about the programs, but also with a lot of financial data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13270.947s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, Pat Vuey, uh, working with, uh, the community schools office, uh, put this together and Farina, Mr. Maloney, uh, Rachel Perry and others put this together so that we could, uh, analyze whatever you had concerns about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13286.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Pat is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13288.615s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, any questions you may have, uh, we can all try to answer them and, uh, go from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13294.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's a pretty extensive report here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13296.018s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can, uh, we're talking about community schools itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13299.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: MHS community pool and the edgily field One other thing to say though some of this material you received at the committee of the whole I mean the subcommittee And build these grounds some of it is additional based on additional requests This is a better day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13737.387s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure of the Reds, because obviously that's a, maybe Bobby can answer that particular thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13742.769s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There was one person who was a coach and, you know, was affiliated with the Reds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13751.152s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Let's start one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13806.359s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you mentioned AIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13810.102s">[Roy Belson]</a>: AIC contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13811.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with the school department through my office and with Pat Velie.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13816.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's a direct contract, and we generate about 60,000 a year, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13821.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, depending on the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13825.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, neither Pat nor I have any affiliation with AIC in any teaching or supervisory role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13834.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: American International College.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13836.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We basically just simply contract with them, and they use our space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13841.708s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13842.508s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, we have nobody teaching a course for AIC in our faculty or our administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13853.03s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Some of our administrators from time to time supervise practicums for people that are looking for advanced degrees or trying to get licensure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13867.803s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think at this point in time, there's maybe just a couple of people that do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13873.107s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Beverly Nelson does some of that, as does Diane Caldwell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13876.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they are not involved in the contractual activities with AIC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13881.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So they have no contact with, in terms of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13884.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I don't believe they're in conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13886.338s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But one of the things we can do is, going forward, we'll run some of this by Mark Rumley and ask him if he's got any thoughts about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13894.224s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And he can check with ethics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13943.083s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty well attended by Medford and others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13944.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, most of the courses are education courses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13948.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If AIC were to expand or some other colleges were to expand, then obviously they'd offer other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13954.324s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with their education courses, mostly individuals were pursuing graduate degrees in education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13961.666s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's really where it's at at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13964.667s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13965.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can take a look.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13981.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We looked at custodial costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13982.726s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We looked at, what do you call it, fare costs that we thought were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13987.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Basically, they run about four to five semesters, four to five, let's say, periods, four to five session periods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13996.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And generally, it comes out to $2,000 to $3,000 a course, maybe $2,000 a course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14002.757s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that they're paying us for for the rooms and for the custodial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14006.16s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So some of them run the same night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14007.521s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that mitigates the cost of the custodian because one custodian can cover five classrooms or four classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14013.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we break it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14014.646s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can give you a breakout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14015.727s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can show you what we charge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14016.768s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, and you can actually look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14032.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just trying to make sure apples are apples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14035.382s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They don't have anywhere near as much coverage of the building as the Japanese do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14039.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're basically talking five classrooms, maybe three nights a week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14049.313s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's pretty substantial from what we're getting from them for the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14051.835s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can show you the break up and you can look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14057.534s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14057.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the Japanese, it's generally $100,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14061.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's moved up from $90,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14063.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We moved that up $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14067.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's what it is, the $200,000 from the Japanese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14070.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's for two years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14074.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's $100,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14080.023s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What we do with that, just so you know, we forward fund that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14083.465s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We ask them for the money up front.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14085.035s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we're two years ahead on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14109.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, custodians would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14110.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Custodians, it's overtime for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14112.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14112.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They're just there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14113.848s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's part of the contract to have overtime.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14115.649s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we'll run personnel by Mark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14119.251s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And let him take a look and see if there's anything he sees that's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14364.54s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you've got to understand that a custodian salary is going to be about $60,000 plus benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14371.827s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if you add benefits to $60,000, you're almost on top of the 93.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14377.402s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the flexibility of the schedules and the different places that people have to be at at different times, you know, creates that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14385.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're actually doing very well with the, you know, with the overtime account in that regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14390.296s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it's substantial because there's a lot of programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14393.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, but if you hire one custodian, pay them benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=110.256s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, it's a distinct pleasure tonight<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=114.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to welcome an individual who represents a fine institution in our community, who has made it possible for our schools to have this outstanding contribution by one of our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=127.606s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to turn it over to our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to explain it, make a presentation, and you have it in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=576.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, no one gets away without a picture, so we've got to get everybody in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=627.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have to memorialize it for the next edition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=875.495s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, we're going to call upon our Director of Humanities to make a presentation to the National Scholastic Medal winner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=882.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll call on Dr. Chiesa to come up here and make that presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=887.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll do it from down there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1161.028s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we're going to call on Dr. Chiesa again to tell us a little bit about National History Day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1167.494s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and also about our Model UN project, and to recognize several of the students who have participated in both of these activities, both of which are really terrific experiences for them and for the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1179.738s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Chiesa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1441.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll get the model in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2214.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to thank Dr. Chiesa for all her work and her faculty and staff for what they put together, Director of Curriculum Bernadette Riccardelli for her work in supporting, and all the teachers who really put a lot of time in helping these young people to really take these events seriously and to participate in things that perhaps we haven't participated in as much in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2237.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And now that we are, we're doing exceptionally well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2240.25s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's to the credit of the students and to the credit of their teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2244.358s">[Roy Belson]</a>: administrators that this happens as well as it does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2248.38s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just alert you that there's even more coming at subsequent meetings next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2254.443s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll just bring this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2256.904s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I will be traveling to New York to participate with Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Global Scholars Program, another example of our young people who are working closely with each other to understand world issues and to exchange ideas and to become<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2274.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: global citizens of the 21st century.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2276.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we've got a lot to look forward to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2278.237s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You're going to see a lot more coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2280.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we're really proud of our young people tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2282.958s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2301.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam members of the committee, you have it in front of you is a report of our meeting with regard to here three pre-budget reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2310.059s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can waive the reading of it tonight at your discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2315.383s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unless there's something you'd like to comment on that's within the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2340.723s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this was our Curriculum Subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2344.826s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It was attended by three members and Mrs. DiBenedetto,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2349.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The minutes are in front of you, if Mrs. Vandekoot would like to highlight something or talk about something in particular, but otherwise you can also waive this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2884.337s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee, just as an off agenda item, but something to make sure that everyone is fully aware of is we were honored to have in our presence at the Medford family network, uh, this past week on Friday,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2897.252s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The speaker of the Massachusetts House, Robert DiLeo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2901.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Speaker DiLeo came with Assistant Majority Leader Donato, Christine Bobber, and Sean Garbley, our two reps, also representing the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2912.703s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mayor Burke was there, School Committee Member Van der Kloot, and School Committee Member Mustone, and School Committee Member Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2921.329s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Were there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2921.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, weren't there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2922.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Came later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2922.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2926.333s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Get mixed up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2927.442s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had nice representation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2930.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We had a wonderful presentation by two parents who had participated, two parents who came from a different country, who really expressed how it helped them make the transition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2943.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the speaker was very impressed with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2946.758s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The program was co-sponsored by the Children's Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2950.401s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Susan Bartley is the executive director of the Children's Trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2954.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The Children's Trust is the premier organization in this state that works to prevent child abuse and works to strengthen families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2964.349s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Susan Barkley has been very active for many, many years, and it's her goal to take the model created by the Medford Family Network in the early 90s, it's 22 years in existence now, and the work of Marie Cassidy, who's been our lead player in that organization for many years,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2982.592s">[Roy Belson]</a>: to take that statewide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2984.493s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And basically, the pitch with the speaker was that this is the way you reduce child abuse, this is the way you help DCF meet their challenges, and this is the way you promote good gateway education into the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=2998.021s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And as the mayor emphasized also, that it was critical that we do these things so that when youngsters come to school, they're ready to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3005.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they have family supports and parents know what's expected of them, and we can move our agenda forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3011.519s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it was a thrill to have the speaker here, to have such a strong delegation from our legislature there, and to have the program that we hold so dear, the Medford Family Network, raised to such a high level of praise by Susan Bartley, who I indicate is sort of the leader in the state for child abuse prevention and for strengthening families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3390.629s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, they're sort of related.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3394.643s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in this instance, we'll call upon our deputy superintendent to introduce someone who she just met this past week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3940.05s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, the enrollment's been pretty stable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3942.384s">[Roy Belson]</a>: at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3943.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The shift sometimes is the grade levels and, you know, the distributions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3948.451s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we want to take things away from people who already have them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3951.976s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We may need a little bit of a shift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3953.418s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I can tell you that as of today, based on what we've seen in previous years, we're 49 students ahead in kindergarten enrollment at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3962.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which tells us that people are coming home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5313.445s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, just before we move on, just want to note that tonight, one of the contracts that we hope to settle tonight will be the nurse's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5323.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've done an excellent job under Tony's leadership and we think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5328.33s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we're able to move forward, and they're certainly taking on more and more responsibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5343.518s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a requirement that we face every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5346.559s">[Roy Belson]</a>: School choice is one of the pieces of legislation that would allow us or would mandate, if we don't reject it, to take a student in from another district at $5,000 based on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5359.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: availability of seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5361.175s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We find that this is not a productive way to increase enrollment and that we have to notify the State Department by June 1st, so we put this on annually and ask that you approve it so that we can formally notify the State Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5405.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, assuming that it doesn't snow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5410.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or there's anything else that might get in the way of closing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5415.116s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This year the last day of school will be Tuesday, June 21st, 2016.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5418.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It says 2015 here, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5423.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Anyone who doesn't show up tomorrow will be in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5427.108s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It'll be a 12 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5428.388s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Release for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5431.269s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The completion of school on this day enables us to meet the state required 180 instructional days minimum and the total hourly minimums for each grade level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5439.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have a schedule for elementary and middle and high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5443.673s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll post that on our webpage and through other channels and make sure that parents receive it from their schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5468.704s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we like to post these meetings as early as we can so that people can plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5472.787s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, this is, uh, we're starting earlier, uh, this year coming up in August.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5479.969s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the meeting dates that won't conflict with various holy days or other considerations that we would consider to be, let's say, not good practice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5494.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You don't want a meeting on Halloween?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5498.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5499.058s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Consider it if we want to come in costume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5517.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5518.101s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if we could approve the calendar tonight and we will come back to the next meeting with a change on October 31st, unless you choose to come in costume.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5525.546s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Mr. Skerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5534.728s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can always make that move.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5535.929s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing is it comes right after school vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5537.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put two meetings in a row.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5538.75s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5539.31s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you want to do that, we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5591.306s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll send you a full update with the opening of school well in advance of the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5694.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, after a number of meetings on this matter, because it involves real estate negotiations, the committee went into session to discuss some of the possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5709.457s">[Roy Belson]</a>: we put this together as a compilation of what you thought was important to be included in specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5717.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Should we decide to go forward with a winter season bubble over the elderly field or sometimes referred to as the field of dreams?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5725.688s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, so it requires your approval for it to go to an RFP development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5731.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Once the RFP is developed, it would then go out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5733.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And of course, any awarding of a lease of any kind would then come back to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5738.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: uh, before it was actually implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5741.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But these are the terms and conditions that we would ask to be put into the, um, RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5749.595s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Uh, and if there's any amendments to them, obviously we would make them this evening if we decided to go forward, uh, with the permission of, uh, mayor, I would read through them for public consumption and also, uh, to allow you some time to reflect on each one so that you may have some thoughts<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5767.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: as we continue our discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5769.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Number one, the contract must include a parking lot for an additional 100 cars on the non-turf practice field adjacent to the turf fields paid for by the vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5780.503s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's the West courtyard field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5783.484s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Two, the contract must include provisions for a field house with adequate indoor bathroom facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5790.027s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should have a heater installed since it's going to be used during the winter months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5794.345s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All costs of installation and maintenance must be borne by the contractor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5798.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Three, the programs operated by the vendor must make substantial provisions for discounting participation fees for Medford youth and residents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5808.036s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that in checking with Mr. Scarpelli, who is actively involved in recreational matters in Somerville and is knowledgeable of our facilities as well, in Somerville they look at a 50% discount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5821.747s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We could change that, add to it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5823.836s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, as, as the case may be, but we could, you know, that's, that's nothing that we have to, uh, uh, decide immediately when we can come back to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5833.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It should be in the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5834.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5836.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Um, and that would be not only for Medford youth, but also for residents for the hours of operation must be established in such a way as to avoid conflict with Medford programs and to avoid late night impact on a butters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5850.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The contract may not operate programs beyond 11 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5853.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: on any evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5855.399s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Six, all operational costs associated with the rented program must be borne by the company or vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5861.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This would include but not limited to electrical, heating, snow plowing, cleanup, maintenance, parking, staffing, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5868.867s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Seven, there should be sufficient insurance coverage borne by the vendor, contractor if you will, to cover any damage or liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5876.751s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The city must be held harmless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5879.243s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All employees of the contractor work on site must be Corey checked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5883.325s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Appropriate security coverage will be provided by the vendor contractor during the contractor's hours of operation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5891.77s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Access to the main school building should be limited to emergencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5896.392s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Nine promotion and advertising of the facility's purpose and use must be reviewed by the city to ensure that there is no misrepresentations. 10,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5906.098s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There must be monthly reporting of activity and facility conditions to the city to ensure that any emergent situations are dealt with in a timely and effective manner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5915.523s">[Roy Belson]</a>: 11, the initial contract would be for a term of seven years with the possibility of three year extension after five years of successful performance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5923.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that means after the fifth year, the committee would then decide whether it wanted to extend the three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5930.432s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There must be an out cause in the contract for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5933.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there was a failure to perform,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5935.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: or there is a transfer of ownership control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5938.73s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Twelve, substantial non-rental time must be available to the Medford Athletic, Physical Education and Community Schools for educational and recreational programs and activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5948.636s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Any subcontractor of the contractor to a third party must be approved in advance by the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5955.06s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So those are the general provisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5957.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If there's something that we missed as coming out of our meetings, or if there's something that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5963.4s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want extended or clarified, we should talk about it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6193.221s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you remember from our discussions, that was to put it, it was to go into, I'm sure we left it off for some reason, but that was to go into the, into a fund that would only be used for either debt reduction if necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6225.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, so they're excluded from there, but if there was a, you know, situation where an ambulance had to come up for some reason and they needed access to a medical<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6235.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: attention immediately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6236.861s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have custodians on duty through 11 o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6238.842s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I mean, so they could enter the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6240.864s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be obviously a call to the building and the building would open.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6243.425s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think for that reason, I don't know, somehow it wouldn't have a key, but I mean, but if you had an emergency there and you needed the building and you didn't open it up, I think we'd be liable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6253.092s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think you've got to be conscious of the fact that the building has to have some kind of availability for an emergency emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6259.397s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not talking about for general reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6261.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, we just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6278.073s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a decision you can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6279.993s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a decision you can make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6339.547s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6340.188s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the only thing I would suggest is that we have a snow day at 7 o'clock in the morning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6347.214s">[Roy Belson]</a>: By the time the vendor gets there at 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, everything's clear, everything is taken care of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6356.006s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, I'm just saying, but let's say that situation would occur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6358.849s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think it should be so absolute, because if we had six, seven, eight days, that's revenue that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6364.422s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a vendor might be interested in, because obviously they're offsetting costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6367.403s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm just doing it to be balanced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6377.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, well, you see there's a cost of snow removal here that's put in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6415.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, you know, I don't think you can ask a vendor, what do you call it, to provide security for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6420.972s">[Roy Belson]</a>: for times when they're not doing their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6424.174s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you load up costs to the vendor, you're not going to get a vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6429.198s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it has to be somewhat balanced, because obviously people want to pay for what they're responsible for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6435.283s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't think you can ask them to pay for things that occur at times when they're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6441.928s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, that's a decision you can make, but I think it might compromise a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6448.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: subtract from other things that the vendor might be willing to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6463.146s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, you know, we can put anything we want into the RFP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6466.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You just want to make sure that it's attractive enough for someone to come in and say, I'm willing to pay for this, do this, do that, you know, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6473.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Is it necessary?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6474.248s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you feel it's necessary, then it goes in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6476.249s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you don't feel it's necessary, then it might<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6479.105s">[Roy Belson]</a>: alter the willingness of someone to bid or to pay for certain things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6491.65s">[Roy Belson]</a>: No, they don't have access to the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6866.126s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's the whole point of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6867.206s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, that's why the 100 spaces, you know, we're asked for 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6871.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: He probably has indicated, you know, in the preliminary thing they needed about 60, but we asked for 100 because I thought there might be some overflow or there might be some situations where other multiple events were running and we might need a few extra spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6883.528s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Or during the regular year when we have other events sweeping, maybe more spaces.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6888.213s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd be the beneficiaries of a larger one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7025.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7033.047s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You may find that you have limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7036.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, you can, um,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7039.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From some of the preliminary discussions, I believe that the vendor that we did talk to to get some information was talking about 4 o'clock in the afternoon during the week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7052.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then on the weekends, having a more expanded time, because obviously they would have more activity in the weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7061.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think they wanted to come in in the morning and then run through the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7064.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that wouldn't really be available to Medford<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7068.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: independent programs on Saturday and Sunday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7071.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that's what I understand from, you know, the preliminary discussions with vendors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7076.655s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I would say four to 11 is probably typical during the week and then probably be something like 8 AM to 11, you know, 11 PM on during the weekends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7278.487s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd go by the city solicitor though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7300.343s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I want it to be a little dollar amount for what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7348.699s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Usually, on penalty fees,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7352.393s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Usually, there's a one-time pass where someone misses something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7355.916s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then the second time, it's one thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7357.277s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then the third time, it's more extensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7359.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then possibly, then you reach a breach of contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7362.801s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But you're essentially, you don't want to dissuade people from doing this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7367.965s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you want it, you don't want to dissuade people from doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7369.967s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You want to make it so difficult for a person to say, I can't take the chance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7373.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to be kicking out all kinds of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7376.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: On the other hand, you also want to send a message that you can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7380.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can't cavalierly break the rules because you will pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7393.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think the other thing, too, is that there are different, you know, violations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7399.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Staying over, not cleaning up, not having security.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7402.722s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm going to think this one through just a little bit because some things are more egregious than others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7407.943s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And, you know, it could be the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7410.468s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A person, if they miss it by a half an hour on a given night, it's not the same thing as blowing it out for two hours, or not having the right cleanup, or not having the right maintenance going on, or not taking care of other things that need to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7424.513s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I mean, there's severities that you want to have some degree of flex.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7508.542s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll put some recommendations down based on calling to some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7635.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So here's the sequence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7637.634s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, I'm listening to everything tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7640.316s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometime tomorrow or the next day, I'll draft up the materials that you're giving me now and we'll run it by you in a temporary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7646.602s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Then we'll send it over to procurement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7648.898s">[Roy Belson]</a>: you know, I mean to actually draw specifications.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7652.719s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7653.019s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then legal to actually look at it at some point, you know, probably early next week when they've had a chance to play it through, we could send you something in the, you know, in the, in the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7664.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The only thing is, is that remember under the open meeting law, you can't deliberate with each other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7669.222s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you can look at it yourself and feedback, but we can't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7674.517s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can't go back and forth as a committee because we're not in open session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7682.619s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7689.622s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7690.522s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7691.142s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But if there is differences between one member and another member, I won't be able to resolve it individually until we get back in open session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7699.885s">[Roy Belson]</a>: OK?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7862.931s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have the letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7880.477s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what you really need to do is we only made one edit where most was added to most charters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7888.68s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's the only change and if there's no objection to that then those who want to sign it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7893.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: before we send it out, and we'll do so in the next little while when we send it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7899.656s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Pardon me?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7901.617s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, we should vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7902.317s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should roll call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7934.818s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Original is April 25.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7946.945s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think it's, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7949.328s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it'll be fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7950.469s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Unless you really feel, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7974.191s">[Roy Belson]</a>: What that is activity that was approved by community schools a while ago and it's happens to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7980.755s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I wanted to make sure that you, I just got it today myself from Mr. Maloney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7984.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I wanted to make sure you knew about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7986.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in case you heard about an event, uh, this is a group that's been active with us in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7995.297s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was told that the projected fee is $3,500.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7999.999s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they spend more time, it'll be higher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8002.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the projected fee at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8008.642s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, again, we still haven't reached the point of having a formal fee schedule and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8014.464s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So this is what was in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8016.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so we just simply have gone along with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8018.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it pays the bills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8021.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Like I said, when we finally arrive at what we're going to do in the future after the ninth or hopefully subsequently after the ninth, uh, these fees will be readjusted to affect, to reflect whatever decisions you make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8069.935s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe it's a non-profit organization, but I can't attest to that at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8080.14s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a non-profit solicitor's non-profit, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8086.955s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not to the general event, to the cultural activities, I believe there's a ticket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8093.661s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8119.357s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Chair, look, we've had a major discussion about rentals and we're going to have another discussion coming up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8127.408s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is an activity, this is a group in this community that's been here before and used our properties before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8133.273s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It would be an embarrassment for me to go to them and say something at this point in time and change the rules as we're operating right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8141.779s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Going forward after the 9th, you can make whatever rules you decide are appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8146.423s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think that's the way it ought to be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8148.145s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you decide everything has to come in front of you, then you're going to have to have every piece of business come in front of you all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8154.41s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8155.772s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But at this particular point, I'm to imply that this group, you know, was any different than any other group that we've had over the years, is really kind of out of line as far as I'm concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8163.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I reach a point where, you know, this is a group, this is a cultural group within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8167.739s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's active within our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8169.56s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We should treat them with respect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8252.668s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I was giving it to you tonight because it was given to me today, so you would know about it and you wouldn't hear about it on a phone call on a weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8262.071s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I try to keep you informed when I know something's going on, but we agreed at our meeting of the whole that we would leave things alone for the rest of this year until we came to a new conclusion about our rental rates and all the stipulations involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8281.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's all I'm saying at this point in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8284.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just simply moving along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8285.823s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I gave it to you tonight so you'd know about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8290.185s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that you will at the, after the ninth and after subsequent meetings, you will have an opportunity to set whatever rules you want to set in place, whatever fees you want to set in place and whatever enforcements you want to set in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8302.794s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that will then govern whatever happens next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8304.895s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then anything of this type, if you want to make it all come in front of you, then all come in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8309.973s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that's the way, you know, we'll do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8311.854s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But that was the understanding we had after the last committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8396.784s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You've received more reports than most people ever see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8400.426s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, and you've received financial reports on all kinds of things, but you'll get even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8404.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So Pat will stop doing the budget to do this one audit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8422.341s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If they're going to what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8425.954s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8426.334s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll have to ask them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=153.32s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So upon approval of the school committee,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=158.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will ask the city to allow us to utilize the money from the public art funds that were appropriated for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=560.065s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I've made no decision at this time and that's up to the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=562.807s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when I'm ready to make a decision and the committee is ready to make a decision, we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=567.371s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But there's no decision at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=685.97s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=689.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: With us is the headmaster of the high school, Dr. Perrella.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=692.753s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This morning, as you know, you were notified that there was a bomb scare sent to Medford High School by robocall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=699.396s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This was also sent to many other schools in the area, including Somerville City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=704.959s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are at least 10 other school districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=706.9s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I provided you with a handout from one of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=710.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: newspaper outlets as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=712.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe the high school handled it exceptionally well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=715.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They did everything that was according to their protocol.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=718.233s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have the report in front of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=720.354s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Local police and fire officials were on hand to assist with the sweep of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=725.678s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Students were kept in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=726.939s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When stabilization took place, students and faculty were notified, and a robocall went out to parents in the community very quickly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=734.665s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Perrella is here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=736.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd be happy to answer any questions that he has and that you may have for him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=740.033s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Brown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1795.511s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think it's a good, it's a great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1797.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's another example of how the city and school work together under the mayor's leadership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1801.476s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the reality is that, sure, we can make it happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1804.986s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we can, good idea about putting it part of the registration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1808.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can move that along and we're electronic so we can pass it to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1840.08s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All that's possible, and it's all good ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1851.822s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, we certainly would work on it this spring, and then have it ready going into the next school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1860.064s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We put in parent information and things of that sort as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1944.628s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As you see from your packet, you also have museum passes and other things too, so it's not just resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1985.907s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We can certainly do all that and we can certainly hype it, you know, over the next several months so that going into the fall is even more robust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3667.936s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3671.578s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We passed a gender non-discrimination policy in 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3677.124s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this past period of time, many organizations have come together to support additional legislation in the Massachusetts Statehouse to deal with all public facilities being available to transgender individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3695.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: public schools are already covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3698.424s">[Roy Belson]</a>: However, this issue is critical to us because as our young people go out into society and they go out into the world, we want to make sure that what they learn in school and what they experience in school is available to them in the larger world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3714.189s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our current policy is a good one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3715.57s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So one way to reinforce it is to give our support to the ongoing legislation that is being proffered at the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3724.433s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3725.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The site council of the high school, working together with the Gay-Straight Alliance and others, has tried to put forth a survey, and will put forth a survey, to help youngsters identify, it's anonymous and it's voluntary, so that we can better serve them, and we can make sure that we have everything in place that is necessary to accommodate our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3753.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that it's important that we also accurately report to the state on the various mandated reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3759.632s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You have the survey questions that are here, you have additional information, you have our gender policy from 2013, and you have pieces of the legislation that is at the state house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3771.262s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I present this report to you this evening to make sure you're fully aware of what we're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3777.541s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that we get your support to go forward and to make sure that we can speak with a very clear voice at the state level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3786.303s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That the Medford School Committee and the city of Medford is in full support of all our youth, including our transgender youth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3792.545s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'd recommend that we approve this this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3795.286s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We have individuals in the audience tonight that headmasters here, I believe a couple of students were here and they're no longer here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3804.061s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay, a couple of them occurred, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3807.07s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them for you, but I ask that you extend your support this evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3854.846s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, at our last meeting, we talked about the substance abuse drug and alcohol policy of the Medford Public Schools and the new legislation, the Opiate Act, if you will, that was passed in the legislature this past month and signed by the governor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3872.138s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Clearly, all of us are concerned, and at our last meeting, at your request, you asked that we withhold posting it until we brought it to you back to your attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3881.201s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This evening, I brought that policy back to you, and I've also added a few things to keep it consistent with the new act, and to clear up a few things that would be inconsistent with the actual act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3893.225s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For example, eliminate the term CASPAR, which is no longer the program of choice here in the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3899.427s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I've tried to put this together for you, and with your support, we will post this on our web page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3907.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will wait for additional guidance from the state, from DESE, from DBH, and others to further update it based on the deliberations that they have as they go forward in carrying out the legislation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3920.815s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But in the interim, it's important that we're compliant with the law that I'll be able to post.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3925.376s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3928.217s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You can see that I've also attached legal advisories from Murphy, Hesse, Toomey, and Lane, who represents us in various areas of special education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3936.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But they're also an excellent source of information in almost any legal matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3949.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yes, and then also we'd be able to post it consistent with the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4003.992s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I know at the high school, we have a very specific form that people sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4008.775s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Perrella can speak to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4011.164s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I know that handbooks are turned out to parents at the lower grade schools, and I'm not sure they have to sign off on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4019.046s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It will require that we take a little bit of time and explain, because some people are concerned when they sign something that they don't fully understand it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4026.587s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So with your permission, we'll do it over the next period of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4031.949s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it takes a little bit of time to explain these things to people, because just to put it in front of them and say, sign your name,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4039.282s">[Roy Belson]</a>: probably wouldn't work with any great degree of, let's say, effectiveness.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4043.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we'd like to sort of do it in small groups with parents and work it through the schools that way so that over the next year everyone signs in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4051.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I think we need to take our time and make sure that, otherwise we're just going to have people signing their name, they're not going to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4057.456s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Understanding it is probably not going to be a very high either in some cases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4061.379s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There will be some very diligent people who will, but it won't be widespread.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4151.89s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Currently the policy reach will not be allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4154.888s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd like to change it to daytime so that we have some discretion because obviously there are some situations out there that require discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4162.752s">[Roy Belson]</a>: One of the things that, I just want to pontificate for a minute if I can, get away with it, and that's simply this, is that we can't be afraid of having discretion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4173.538s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Sometimes you make hard and fast rules and they don't apply to everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4177.7s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then you're stuck with that rule.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4179.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think it's very important to make it may not so that we can look at a circumstance and make a determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4185.791s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Hopefully we're being fair and even handed across the board, but when something becomes so hard and fast, it becomes necessary to enforce it with everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4193.561s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's why it may not came in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4647.717s">[Roy Belson]</a>: As school administrators, we make decisions about young people every day, who get something, who doesn't get it, because we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4655.625s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a human enterprise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4658.39s">[Roy Belson]</a>: abdicate our discretion or abdicate our judgment, we're basically just robots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4662.951s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just following mechanics when it comes to young people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4666.591s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's important to understand the circumstances that young people find themselves in at different times and how they were involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4674.193s">[Roy Belson]</a>: A person could be at a site where alcohol is there and then not be a user themselves and might be blamed for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4682.714s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Another person could be there and actually be distributing it or distributing drugs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4687.504s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4688.825s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There are differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4690.305s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And so our responsibility as your leadership team and management team is to be able to accept the responsibility of making discretionary judgments and not to abuse it and not to give away anything that isn't deserved or punish people in ways that are inappropriate, but rather to ensure that there is a review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4712.863s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and there is an understanding, because without that, we're basically on autopilot, and then I don't think we're being fair to our young people and our families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4721.012s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I understand the downside, but we make a lot of decisions about what goes on every day, and you need to trust us to do that, because if not, schools can't run.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4745.607s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Dr. Perrella is the headmaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4746.869s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If he has doubts, he'll come to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4749.172s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If he has a clear understanding, I will respect his judgment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6113.292s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, our legal counsel, Howard Greenspan, is here to report on the matter that you referred to him and our committee the whole with regard to rental and school properties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6124.439s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At this time, I'd like you to welcome Howard Turner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6474.994s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So researching the issue as well,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6478.879s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I found that, as Mr. Greenspan explained, that in the minutes of the March meeting, we indicated we would post those policies that had been approved of March of 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6496.067s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you go online, and remember the online policies were posted by MASC based on the fact that we had approved them, and the ones we hadn't approved were still pending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6506.706s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you look at the policies online, you will find that the policies, the four policies we're talking about, are not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6515.229s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So what it means to me is that we didn't get to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6519.311s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We hadn't really dealt with it yet, and that two of the policies that were MA Medford policies were older policies that we had had from older yearbooks that might have been available through hard copy, but they weren't available online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6534.117s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So as a result,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6535.829s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's clear to me, at least from my standpoint, you know, concurrent with our attorneys, is that we need to decide what you want to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6545.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The law doesn't prohibit us, but the four policies either contradict themselves, and they weren't posted by MASC because clearly Jim Hardy, who was our consultant at the time,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6555.654s">[Roy Belson]</a>: didn't get the go-ahead from the committee at that time to post it because we hadn't got that far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6561.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'd done so much that we wanted to get as much as possible up, but we really didn't get that far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6566.923s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So in the interim, if I can, just for a little bit more and then certainly take any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6572.62s">[Roy Belson]</a>: In the interim, Pat Bealy has convened a committee with community schools and several of us working on it to come up with a draft policy for your consideration, which obviously you can change, adjust, modify, add to, subtract, as you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6589.365s">[Roy Belson]</a>: with a fee structure, and we would hope to present that to you very shortly, probably at our next meeting, so that you can look at it and begin the process of agreeing what you want to be the policy of the Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6601.029s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's much more comprehensive than anything we've ever had, it's much more detailed, and it also reflects a lot of the discussions that you've had in our discussions and meetings as to what you have indicated were concerns that you had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6614.312s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, I think we're,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6617.15s">[Roy Belson]</a>: and attract to come up with a new policy, one that you will have obviously the final say over, and whatever you decide, we'll implement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6624.436s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as Howard points out in his reference, in going over the issue of revenue, it becomes extremely important that we understand that revenue is key to keeping some of these facilities going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6636.866s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we need to understand the balance between<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6640.168s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Programs that provide revenue and programs that are simply community oriented, that we are supporting activities within the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6646.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's a balancing act.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6648.374s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But having said that, I'll be happy to answer any other questions you have or I'm sure direct them to Mr. Greenspan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6664.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: My answer to that is I don't believe any of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6667.246s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I believe they all were in discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6954.877s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, Madam Mayor, you know, we've agreed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6958.8s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is not something that, you know, we need to say, oh, we've agreed to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6963.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But we first wanted a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6966.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We now have a legal opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6968.647s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We told you that we've sat and worked on a comprehensive policy for you to review with a fee structure based on what we think is necessary to sustain the operation of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6981.216s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will provide you with every renter, every user,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6985.288s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're also preparing for you a policy with regard to booster organizations, which will require that booster organizations register with the schools so that we have some access to their materials and we can track their materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7000.272s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So there's a lot that's coming forward to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7003.593s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You know, it just takes a little bit of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7005.744s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We pulled it all together to do it right, and we waited for the appropriate legal opinion, and we did our homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7013.131s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I think that over the next month, you're going to see a lot, and you're going to have a chance to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7017.675s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the reality is, is that going into the summer, into the next school year, you'll have a policy in place, assuming that you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7024.862s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that you'll have fees in place, assuming you approve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7028.417s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And you have a structure that we believe will answer your questions and the questions of other people, and at the same time allow us to move forward in a constructive way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7036.983s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I believe it's happening, and I believe that there's a lot of goodwill here, and I believe everybody wants it to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7042.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we certainly want to take any doubt away from anyone about the operation of the schools with regard to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7050.81s">[Roy Belson]</a>: nonprofit, community, and other groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7055.414s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's also important as we go forward that you help us to identify to what extent, if any, you want to allow certain groups to have a pass in terms of the rental or the use of the school facilities, such as community organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7069.845s">[Roy Belson]</a>: How often, how frequently, so that we can fairly distribute them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7073.488s">[Roy Belson]</a>: This is a very involved process because there are many, many people who see the schools as a place where they can conduct their activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7082.151s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you're going to get a very comprehensive report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7084.911s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's going to be very thorough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7086.132s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I believe that when we come out of this school year, you're going to have something very, very well thought through and something that you will have had a very strong hand in developing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7184.748s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Our goal would be to allow our community groups to have access while we are developing things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7190.572s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, going forward, you may decide that there needs to be a modest fee or some type of fee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7196.315s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But for the short period of time that they would be inside, remember, this is April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7200.638s">[Roy Belson]</a>: For the short period of time they would have to remain inside, we'd like to sort of not try to construct some sort of artificial fee structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7213.805s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not for the batting cages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7214.886s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not for the batting cages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7247.712s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Insurance liability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7403.961s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Do you want to discuss anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7482.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So here's the way it would work, okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7486.275s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If you approve it this evening, we will contact the individuals who run these organizations and talk to them about what their schedules they would like to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7498.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we will try to work their schedules into times where we have existing supervision in that part of the facility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7506.302s">[Roy Belson]</a>: To the extent that we don't,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7508.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We will calculate as to whether or not the cost of supervision is extraordinary enough to worry about it, or if it's just marginal in order to help community organizations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7519.265s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's small enough, we probably would absorb it under our normal operational costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7524.847s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it were extensive and they wanted to use it, then we would have to say we can't do it unless you're prepared to pay for that supervision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7533.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, we obviously recognize the legitimacy of the concern, but at the same token, we're trying to say we want our community groups to feel wanted, while at the same time, we want to make sure that we understand that this is a temporary measure and that all things will be put in place and we'll ask for their cooperation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7593.605s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are guidelines, and I will ask the athletic director to inform me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7617.715s">[Roy Belson]</a>: When you say something happens, would we talk about injury?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7621.276s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if an injury were to happen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7623.44s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's no gross negligence on our part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7626.041s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7626.941s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're only responsible for gross negligence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7629.022s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And Mr. Greenspan can comment if, in fact, I miss something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7632.043s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But with regard to the issue of general negligence and the like, we would expect that the people who are running the program would be responsible and that our supervisor would follow the rules that we set in front of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7796.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So the answer to that is you can have us do anything you want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7800.446s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just making a suggestion that it might be possible to help out community groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7805.889s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're referring to the youth baseball activities that are in the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7809.59s">[Roy Belson]</a>: That's all we're referring to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7810.651s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not referring to outside groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7812.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're not referring to anyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7813.612s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're just referring to youth groups.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7828.347s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's what has to be, you know, worked out in the final analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7831.089s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So when we get to talk to these people, we'd say, I'll call a meeting of them or ask them to come in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7836.777s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I'll ask for some scheduling possibilities that they might like to have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7840.899s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe they don't want to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7841.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Maybe they'll turn around and say, you know, it's not worth it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7843.96s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But, you know, if it's worth it to them, we'll schedule it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7847.161s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And then we'll determine who's going to open and close and, you know, and supervise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7886.553s">[Roy Belson]</a>: All I said to you a little bit before was that if it's a small amount of money that's required,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7892.075s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And there's not someone else up there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7893.817s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Remember, there's three different batting cages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7896.599s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So if our team is using one of them, somebody can use the other two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7900.582s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, or whatever the case may be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7902.264s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So, you know, if we can't cover it with someone who's already going to be there, we'll assess the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7908.149s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it's minor, you know, a few hundred dollars, you know, for a few, for a couple weeks, then we'll absorb it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7913.834s">[Roy Belson]</a>: If it's not, then we'll not allow it or ask them to pay it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7930.234s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Well, that's an acceptable facility of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7932.515s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So at this point in time, you know, the fire department hasn't found any problem with our use of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7939.179s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been in the pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7940.12s">[Roy Belson]</a>: They've been in that entire area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7944.603s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And they're aware that students are up there in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7948.713s">[Roy Belson]</a>: At any time, if something were to go wrong, certainly they could come in and change their mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7952.037s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But as far as I'm concerned, they've cleared it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7960.447s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'll have to check on that with Mr. Malone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8007.088s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's already been sent, we call it, to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8008.589s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We're going to bring you back a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8243.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, at a previous meeting you asked me to draft a letter that to some degree paraphrased the letter sent by the Ludlow School Committee to our legislative delegation with regard to the Charter School cap lift, recommending that the legislature reject that particular item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8268.799s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, specifically, the State Senate,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8273.737s">[Roy Belson]</a>: passed a bill the other day through the Senate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8277.398s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It isn't legislative, it isn't law, but it passed through the Senate, which is a comprehensive approach to the charter school issues that have been discussed throughout the Commonwealth, much more broadly based than some other discussions have been, and dealing with much more than the charter cap lift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8298.044s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There's going to be some debate on Beacon Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8302.226s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I don't believe that the Senate bill in its entirety is going to be accepted by the House or approved by the Governor, but there may be elements of it that are acceptable by the House and by the Senate, and maybe even by the Governor down the road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8318.497s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But certainly, the House and the Senate would probably get together and have a discussion about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8326.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: From our standpoint, I drafted a letter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8330.057s">[Roy Belson]</a>: which would be consistent with it, but it wasn't done in the context of the Senate's passage of this bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8337.683s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would ask that you study this material, and maybe I would draft another letter since this is going to be a pending discussion going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8346.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because I think that the letter that I originally drafted for you is probably a little bit out of date,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8355.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the fact that there is a change in what's going on on Beacon Hill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8361.957s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I'll do whatever you want, but I think that there's quite a bit of ferment going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8367.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it may be that the Rise Act that is consistent with the charter school legislation is something you want to take into consideration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8377.702s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The letter that I drafted for you is on the back page, the last page of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8384.104s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if you haven't had a chance to read it, maybe you should take a few seconds and read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8390.37s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it paraphrases or closely paraphrases the letter that was sent from Ludlow with a few changes that reflect more of a Medford issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8399.919s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Because since our issues are not totally Ludlow's issues and our numbers are slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8409.555s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just want to tell you that the preliminary numbers on charter schools have been posted by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8418.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And this year we have 344 students attending charter schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8421.838s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Next year the department is projecting we have 315, a substantial reduction of 29 students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8428.539s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So that's not necessarily a final number, it could be a change up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8433.865s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it certainly is a trend that we were hoping for because obviously that puts junctures back in our schools and also deals with money as opposed to it going outside of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8449.975s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So happy to answer any questions you have or continue the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8488.711s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8489.932s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd also want to say that, you know, we have a meeting May 2nd, so that I would probably bring it back to you for approval on May 2nd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8617.323s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that necessarily we're going to get agreement in a short period of time with the legislature and with the governor and everyone else like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8624.087s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I do believe that there are some pieces in the Senate's legislation that we should be supportive of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8631.652s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I mean, for example, within the Senate's legislation is full funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8636.588s">[Roy Belson]</a>: the school districts, as opposed to partial funding that we're getting now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8641.011s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Within the Senate's piece, there is a piece that calls for a reimbursement formula that's more realistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8648.938s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So reality-wise, we should probably want to reference those items.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8653.501s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Now, I'm not going to reference the items about good, bad, or indifferent about charter schools, because that's not what I think you're asking me to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8662.268s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I would like to be sure that we're able to be on record as saying is that there is a bill out there that is asking for full funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8670.278s">[Roy Belson]</a>: There is a bill that is asking for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8673.998s">[Roy Belson]</a>: that there be reporting, that individuals would know who's going and who's not going, that there be better demographics taken across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8680.72s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Not necessarily, some schools have done well, but other schools have not done well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8684.562s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I think those are things that we should want to be on record and show that we're knowledgeable of the latest things that are being discussed on the Hill, as opposed to being four weeks behind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8694.783s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I think that that's, you know, I think that makes us much sound much more intelligent when we present a letter to the Commonwealth saying that we're aware of what's being discussed rather than we wrote something a month ago and still sending it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8769.171s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So we are scheduling a committee of the whole on April 25th, that's a week sooner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8779.157s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Yeah, but what I would do is I would send it out to you well in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8783.099s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'd draft it this week and send it out to you over the vacation period and let you look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8788.242s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And if it came in April 25th, we'd make it a standalone item along with the committee of the whole reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8794.855s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And we could go from there, that would be a week earlier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8796.716s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But I do think you should have some of the latest stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8801.218s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I just don't think you should be talking about things that may not be in play right now going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8841.122s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Please do it soon so I can really reach them and get you in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8931.568s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I may also mention that I gave you an article this evening, it was in the American Prospect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8937.29s">[Roy Belson]</a>: The individual who wrote the article used to write for Commonwealth Magazine, now writes as a deputy editor for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8946.253s">[Roy Belson]</a>: American Prospect, which is a very progressive publication out of Washington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8952.679s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Robert Kuttner, Robert Reich are, you know, part of the editorial board of this particular group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8960.946s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So it's fairly strong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8964.749s">[Roy Belson]</a>: magazine, if you will, or commentary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8966.991s">[Roy Belson]</a>: But it talks about the great diversion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8969.153s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It talks about the money moving away from the traditional schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8973.017s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's not passing judgment on whether or not charters are good, bad, or indifferent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8977.1s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's just asking the question, can you support two school systems with a finite amount of money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8982.786s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And that's really sort of the harder part of this discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8986.63s">[Roy Belson]</a>: can we really do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8987.93s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So I recommend you read it and become familiar because there's a lot of stuff going on that's affecting other communities, not affecting us as much right now, but it could going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8998.053s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And it's the kind of discussion that's going to happen over the next several months, especially if it goes to a ballot question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9003.635s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you need to know these things, and it's important that you stay up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9148.94s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We are putting data together for you based on your request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9200.428s">[Roy Belson]</a>: While we're up, I also heard today that the passing of Linda Houston, who once was a secretary of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9210.492s">[Roy Belson]</a>: She's a member of the DePasquale family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9213.552s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And I met her, so if you could take another second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9216.653s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9233.176s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Just a couple of quick things for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9235.197s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Again, I'll send you out information on our beginning of the pre-budget season on April 25th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9240.419s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We'll send out the materials early next week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9243.372s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So you'll have them to go over and begin to look at various departments and programs to give you a preview of the kinds of concerns we may have going into budget, so you can begin to ask questions about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9256.038s">[Roy Belson]</a>: Additionally, in the back of your packet, we have the responses that I sent to the city council based on the various things that they had asked over the last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9268.692s">[Roy Belson]</a>: a few months with regard to security and substance abuse and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9272.913s">[Roy Belson]</a>: So please review that so that if you're asked whether or not we sent that, this used to be, you know, some question as to what we did, we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9280.454s">[Roy Belson]</a>: And the other thing is, is that some of you were able to attend, but I do have some information from Robert Brooks, who spoke at the Symposium on Addiction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9291.556s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I thought it was an excellent program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9294.196s">[Roy Belson]</a>: I'm glad that some people made it, approximately 80, 90 people there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9299.314s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We thought some of the things went well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9300.915s">[Roy Belson]</a>: We would have liked more people to have been there, but I understand that's Saturday, and sometimes it doesn't work, but it's an important activity, and it does continue our efforts to inform the community about these matters and keep them involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9314.318s">[Roy Belson]</a>: You all know that the play was this past weekend, and many of you attended, and I know that you've all told me how wonderful it was, and I think that, you know, it's another<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9325.874s">[Roy Belson]</a>: It's an important accomplishment of our young people, so I think it's important that we recognize them at some point going forward.<br><br>
