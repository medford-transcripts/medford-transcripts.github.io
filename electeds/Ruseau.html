    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9531.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9541.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9547.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=181.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: The agenda for tonight is the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=184.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's only one thing on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=185.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: The purpose of the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee is to review the resolution on the disciplinary practice of suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=193.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will read the resolution, which is going to be the shortest thing I've read so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=199.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: The resolution was sent to the subcommittee by the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=203.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: last Thursday, I believe, or I don't remember when our meeting was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=209.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Resolution on the Disciplinary Practice of Suspension, whereas Mayor Lungo Kern and the Medford City Council have declared racism a public health emergency, whereas Black, Latinx, and disabled students are disproportionately suspended, whereas suspensions harm students that are not suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=226.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: Whereas dropout rates are higher among students that are suspended, whereas out-of-school suspensions increase the likelihood of juvenile arrest, whereas suspended students are more likely to repeat a grade level, whereas students that are suspended are not being educated, whereas school attendance is a critical requirement to receive an education, whereas receiving an education is a requirement of academic achievement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=254.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: And whereas student achievement is the highest goal of all school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=258.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools, one, ends the use of out-of-school suspensions effective the first day of the school year 2021, two, provides for the continuation of a learning environment for every in-school suspension, ensures that two, three, ensures that in-school suspensions will not occur in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=281.069s">[Ruseau]</a>: Four, select alternative tools for use in disciplines such as restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=286.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: And five, incorporates any funding requirements to ensure the implementation of the selected alternatives with fidelity in the next budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=295.34s">[Ruseau]</a>: At this time, I will open the floor to anybody who has questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=299.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: Any members want to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=323.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you all could raise your hands, just so I can figure out who to call on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=337.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: Either one is fine because there's not 450 people in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=343.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=490.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=492.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=493.98s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody else must want to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=495.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: They all came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=500.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=500.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=502.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=506.523s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=507.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: I guess it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=820.0s">[Ruseau]</a>: Apparently, okay, can I share just one thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=826.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a lot of things open on my screen, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=836.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: There it is, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=839.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=840.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=844.07s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody see that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=850.898s">[Ruseau]</a>: So one of the questions I had after listening to Mr. DeLeva was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=857.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: actually, it might have been Mr. Downs that mentioned that suspensions are, you know, in-school suspensions are treated the same because there's not an education being provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=868.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the state is still definitely reporting them separately as distinct things, Mr. Downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=924.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: So are you saying nobody is tracking the difference between taking them out of the classroom and sending them to guidance and sending them home for a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=941.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul, Mr. Delato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=951.662s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=956.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=957.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=959.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: Stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=960.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: Share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=960.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=961.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=962.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=965.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, my understanding is they're really, I mean, I understand that the law might say that they're the same thing, but unless somebody is telling me we never send a kid home and that they're always still on the premises, then there is a difference regardless of what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1061.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to share their screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1063.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have it right here in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1064.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is definitely not zeros across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1067.705s">[Ruseau]</a>: For in-school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1069.586s">[Ruseau]</a>: They have student discipline days missed reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1076.19s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's no, I can't know whether or not discipline days missed means, if you're saying we don't have an in-school suspension program, then these are all days that kids were not in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1090.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we're not reported at all when we take them out of class for two periods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1097.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because that's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1112.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm looking at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1295.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: In favor of in-school suspension or better yet, getting to the root of the cause because, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1304.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1324.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you know where my phone is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1330.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1410.969s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1411.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1563.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1564.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would, if I may, if we were equitably providing suspensions, I would be more than willing to have a conversation around how we can solve the problems that cause suspensions, but we are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1583.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: 62% of suspensions adjusted for race were not white people, and 38% were white people, white students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1593.439s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that tells me, unless we are comfortable having a conversation around the suggestion that the black kids are worse than the white kids, which I am not comfortable with, and I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that's an accurate view, that we have two problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1608.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have the problem of how do we address kids that might actually need a suspension?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1614.434s">[Ruseau]</a>: which is what I hear you talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1616.555s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't hear you talking about the fact that the primarily white staff notices the black kids doing the same things the white kids are doing, and they're the ones that get suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1626.521s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's like, it's almost tiring that that needs to be repeated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1632.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that nobody's offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1634.446s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also hope that if you are offended, you understand that you are not understanding the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1640.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: But,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1642.509s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, this, this problem is not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1646.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: First of all, your example of a knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1647.911s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, I grew up in rural New Hampshire and I would have been shocked if any of the kids didn't in high school didn't have a knife in their pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1655.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: That would be weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1656.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there wasn't a time, you know, long ago, perhaps even in my lifetime, when in some parts of this country, people brought guns to school and that wasn't actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1666.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: call the police scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1668.032s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, what I think of as like suspendable behavior and what you think of and what everybody thinks of isn't the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1678.395s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it isn't the same for every child either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1681.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: Which child is considered performing a suspendable behavior isn't the same child to child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1688.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1690.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: My biggest concern right now is not whether or not a kid comes to school with a pocket knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1694.802s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I'm not talking about a big Bowie knife that is intended to behead a deer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1698.743s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm talking about a pocket knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1701.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: If that kid's getting suspended, I would say that's already a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1704.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I think if there's intent or any reason to believe that that knife is there for a violent purpose,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1713.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a different conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1714.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: But just the presence of a pocket knife, I mean, I think would be a pretty shocking reason to suspend, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1724.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: And again, everybody has an opinion, and everybody's opinion is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1728.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's another problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1731.707s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, this resolution was intended to solve the problem that has not been solved with all of the good work of all of the good people in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1740.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do believe it's good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1742.63s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not an attack on anybody, but it is still not getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1748.852s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I think that a new, looking at this in a different light of, okay, we aren't gonna solve the racial disparities in how kids are seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1761.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: simply by wishing it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1763.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we can all take anti-bias training till we're blue in the face, but unless you grew up under a rock, you're still going to see the black kids as the kids that are threatening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1775.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so it's, I feel like it's my job on the school committee to figure out how to make sure that they're not getting suspended because these out of school suspensions are not just times where they're missing their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1787.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1788.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: dramatically increased rates of dropping out, which we need to rephrase that all together, but also the opportunities to be involved with the police are dramatically increased when kids are not in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1805.31s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll let other people talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1807.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1808.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2050.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, do I have to unmute you, Stacey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2433.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's my understanding, my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2462.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just a quick point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2465.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Department of Ed data that we reported to them indicated that 81% of our out-of-school suspensions, students disciplined with out-of-school suspensions, 81% of those were non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2483.365s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would suggest if the feeling is that there's a threat involved, we need to take a hard look at how we're coding this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2491.797s">[Ruseau]</a>: because the story I'm hearing is that we're really concerned about the safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2496.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the safety of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2498.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody vandalizes the wall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2500.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: That doesn't seem like a safety offense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2503.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would just ask that we, you know, as a note, realize we need to be really caring about how we report all of this data, because this is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2515.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the data reported<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2516.914s">[Ruseau]</a>: said that, you know, we were doing all these suspensions because people were trying to kill other kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2522.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wouldn't we wouldn't have this resolution and we wouldn't be having this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2525.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: But instead, it says 81 percent of the suspensions at the high school, at least, were for non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2534.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: That to me is chewing gum, swearing at a teacher, writing on a wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2540.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I don't know what other other things fall in that category, but the vast majority are for things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2546.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: don't sound like what you're all concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2548.951s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that concerns me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2551.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: The other one thing I did want to quickly mention, and now I forgot it, but I'll come back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2557.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I do want to let Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2558.817s">[Ruseau]</a>: Moretti, who's been waiting a long time with her hand up, I apologize, speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2562.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you unmute yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2563.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2777.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2990.009s">[Ruseau]</a>: Superintendent, you would like to speak, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3122.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3122.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I'll have, um, may go next then, uh, member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3129.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where did they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3130.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did she, he or she lower their hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3144.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: Uh, never Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3352.608s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to say one quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3358.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: When I was writing the resolution, I didn't just sit down and pop it out in a half an hour and call it a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3363.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I did, I would say, many hours of research and read plenty of articles about how just banning it and calling it a day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3373.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: creates full-blown chaos and it's a nightmare for districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3376.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are plenty of districts that have done that in California, for instance, where no resources and no planning and no alternatives were even considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3385.495s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was just the school boards over there, just like it might've been in the legislature, just said no out-of-school suspensions and chaos ensued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3395.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: And often that stuff was even reversed so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3400.532s">[Ruseau]</a>: want to be clear that this resolution was not an attempt to just, you know, stick it to you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3406.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: That wasn't the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3407.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: The goal was to, as Member Graham pointed out, you know, if we pass this, it is inclusive of the requirement that we provide the resources, which I heard earlier from Mr. Peleba and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3421.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: Schulman that, you know, there was a program, it wasn't necessarily the best one, but then the resources just went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3427.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3430.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: The committee has to be as committed to making this happen long after, if we pass this, long after this passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3440.217s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we can't just forget at budget time that the restorative justice or whatever other program, that it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3449.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aside from the staff, literally there's a lot of costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3452.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I went to every single session on restorative justice at school committee conferences,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3458.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: on how to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3460.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: And most importantly, I was looking at what not to do, because every district seemed to have a story about how they screwed that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3468.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the theme among all of those districts that the biggest takeaways for how to not do it right was to not put any resources into it, to just think your staff is going to wake up in the morning and know what restorative justice is, or do it in one grade level and just hope it kind of just flows up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3488.843s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is not an attempt to just flip a switch, call it a day, and put a check mark next to our names that we cared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3497.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think Mr. Assistant Superintendent Murphy would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3795.634s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Dave, Mr. Barker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3798.295s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just would use the words implied disproportionality, I believe you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3803.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's be crystal clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3804.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is no implication here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3806.336s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is absolutely no question that it is disproportionate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3811.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: And any argument against that, I would just love to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3833.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3834.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3835.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: Looking at the amendments on the screen, and then I will call on Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3838.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3840.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, across the nation, I don't really mind that part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3844.736s">[Ruseau]</a>: It does sound a bit defensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3846.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like, let's be clear, it's not just a Medford problem, but I think what just happened to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3853.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: I lost that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3859.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3860.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maryse, was that yours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3864.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3866.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why don't we let Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3867.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rodriguez speak now, since she<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3992.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3993.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there another, Mr. Downs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4081.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4082.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think this is a really, really important point that Mr. Downs just brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4087.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, and I could never for a second defend, you know, suggest that we not defend victims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4096.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I also want to remind everybody that I don't believe there's any spot in the law that says we can just permanently take a student and never educate them because they have become a perpetrator against the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4106.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: They still have to get an education too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4109.613s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not talking about adults who can be just sent off to the prison and never seen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4115.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're talking about a kid who did something wrong to another kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4118.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: And looking at the data, there's been no sexual assaults reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4122.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: I find that hard to imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4124.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm guessing it's, again, more of we're not reporting it the way it really happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4129.028s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I find that really problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4133.17s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when a kid does something to another kid, no matter how egregious, that other kid is coming back to school, whether it's tomorrow, a week from now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4144.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: the victim doesn't suddenly become whole and happy and like it never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4149.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the approach is to use punitive measures against the perpetrator, and that's the end of the story, we're not helping the victims at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4160.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because first of all, the perpetrators are likely to be doing it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4165.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, the short term problem of dealing with an incident can't be the whole plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4174.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do we make it so that these two kids who are in the same AP bio class are going to be able to be in the same AP bio class for the rest of the semester?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4186.21s">[Ruseau]</a>: Suspending one of them isn't going to make it easy on the other person, the other student, at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4194.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they might feel better for a minute, like, yay, Johnny got suspended for doing what he did to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4201.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: that doesn't make it any more comfortable for the victims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4204.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I just think that focusing on, and that's the whole point of restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4209.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that is just in the resolution, it is such as restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4215.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not prescriptive as to what the school system will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4218.22s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would leave it to the professionals to figure out what the right choice is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4222.963s">[Ruseau]</a>: Restorative justice is one of several programs that are available and I have not evaluated them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4227.987s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's why it's not prescriptive as to what one gets to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4232.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just the only, it's the one I've heard of the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4235.716s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, but, you know, the whole scenario that we have to be able to take the kid out that did something terrible, we're not talking about murder here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4245.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, and we're not, according to the statistics that we keep reporting, we're not talking about sexual assaults and rapes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4254.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're talking about, according to this, the vast majority of these are non-violent, non-drug,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4262.071s">[Ruseau]</a>: criminal offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4264.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's not Johnny punched somebody in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4267.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not a rape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4272.498s">[Ruseau]</a>: The vast majority of these kids who are losing their education and are having increased probability of ending up in prison are kids that are doing things that I'm betting everybody on this call has done all of those things, many of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4288.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4289.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need to be careful with false equivalencies and drawing generalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4293.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also think that even for those severe things, unless there's some kind of loophole I know of where we can just say, Johnny, you don't ever come back to Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4304.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4306.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: That kid's coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4307.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that kid's going to make the victim uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4310.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's worry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4312.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4315.64s">[Ruseau]</a>: My son's a ninth grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4317.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is he going to do anything wrong in his whole four years in high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4320.191s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4320.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that we have a plan more than just punishing him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4325.034s">[Ruseau]</a>: What about the person that got hurt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4327.696s">[Ruseau]</a>: So who else wants to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4332.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4534.605s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5050.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. Murphy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5139.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5141.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I guess my question, and I apologize for not knowing this, but if we pass this, and of course you are suspending as required or allowed under statutory<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5154.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: authority, and looking at the current Department of Ed dashboard, which is terrible, if anybody's not looked at it, you're lucky, is it a breach of any privacy rules for you to tell us explicitly what those suspensions were as related to how they were covered by the law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5220.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5221.02s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think if I'm not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5224.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: speaking for Michael that just spoke, you know, I mean, having this opening, which is there whether we put that in there or not, is fine as long as we can have a, you know, trust but verify that the stuff you put into that category is in fact, we can verify that you truly put the right things in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5250.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I don't believe that the reporting on the Department of Ed's website is actually, unfortunately, and I don't, I mean, it's such a terrible website that I'm not surprised, but they really should just have a, you know, a section for required by that statute 222 or whatever it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5268.523s">[Ruseau]</a>: a whole dropdown that just simply lists that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5270.564s">[Ruseau]</a>: So those would be the ones that you have to report that way and that you don't have a choice on suspension or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5277.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unfortunately, they don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5278.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I, you know, I just, you know, it can't be that today the report shows that 81% of the suspensions are for non-violence, non-drug and non-criminal related offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5291.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we do this and two years from now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5294.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: It turns out that we're at 80% of our suspensions are for violence, as if suddenly the whole population became violent overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5303.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think we're all on the same page there, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5363.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we can agree on the last part of that, not on the first part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5367.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if the student has not been imprisoned, they still have a right to an education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5373.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: I agree with that part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5380.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I don't know whose hand was up next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5381.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it was miss member grams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5724.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to let everybody know we are a little over time, so I will let a couple of, if you could be brief, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5752.179s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will bring that up right at the end, because it's not that it's not relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5757.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's, I believe, an entire meeting unto itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5761.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. DeLava?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5841.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5841.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. Murphy, did you want to speak real quick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5844.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5845.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5846.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in the chat early on, there was a comment from Lisa and Michael about the issue of removing from the academic setting, which is sort of at the root of suspension from the academic, providing an education perspective, in that during our pandemic,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5874.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: What does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5876.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if somebody is excluded from a class, my son, he had changed his name briefly in the Google Meet or Zoom session in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5888.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as a result, the teacher kicked him out, which was fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5892.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the teacher at the moment didn't know that, in fact, there was no way to add him back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5897.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so he was without that class for a while until we noticed that he wasn't actually participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5903.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was not an intentional type of situation that happened there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5907.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the issue of excluding from the academic setting while we're in a remote educational situation, really, I mean, we would need several more hours tonight to go over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5922.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: That is an important topic, I think, that hopefully the administration and principals are talking to their staff about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5928.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: What does that mean to mute students, to remove them from classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5934.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are issues that, from a purely academic perspective, they're the same as suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5942.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we probably would, nobody would ever call it that, but that's probably a fairly accurate analogy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5949.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm going to bet we won't ever report that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5952.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: How on earth could we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5954.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just think it's an important thing to make sure that is being talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5963.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's, it's, it's, we're way over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5965.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't know that I can really, Superintendent have, have you all had conversations about this particular topic yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5977.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry to put you on the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6042.0s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I think about this particular scenario, it reminds me of the impact over intent is an important consideration here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6053.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I've been muted on a meeting and I didn't take it personally, but that doesn't mean somebody else being muted didn't take it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6060.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we're talking about young children,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6063.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: they don't necessarily just take it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6066.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: It might really be a severe impact to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6069.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: And certainly, obviously, would impact their ability to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6072.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I appreciate that you'll bring that up with your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6077.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there anybody who wants to say anything finally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6079.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6081.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't have really a copy of the amended version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6087.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if the members are comfortable with the amendments we've discussed, we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6094.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: we can cobble those together in a document, send it in the packet, and then if we get it wrong, we simply can amend it during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6103.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there a motion to approve this as amended with the superintendent's changes and the reporting changes that member Gramp offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6114.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: And forgive me if there are other amendments that I'm not thinking of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6154.574s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6158.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6158.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: And member McLaughlin, I believe you have to do a roll call because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6174.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6174.589s">[Ruseau]</a>: Three in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6176.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the resolution as amended will be sent to the school committee for our meeting following the next, I believe is the 28th of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6186.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6189.382s">[Ruseau]</a>: as with anything that we send up, the school committee is more than welcome to amend it at that time as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6195.384s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this does not necessarily make it set in stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6199.865s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any other comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6202.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6203.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6203.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6223.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6224.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Member McLaughlin, if you could take a roll call for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6228.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6231.703s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6236.104s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6236.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody, and have a nice evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6238.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: And good luck tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6239.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: My kids are very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2826.661s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2829.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just not for this particular one, but I do believe we'll have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2832.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: roll calls for everything with a member online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2841.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2842.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2843.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2844.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Kretz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2859.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2860.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3758.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: No questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3761.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Roussell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3762.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would just like to thank you for the effort to find all this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3767.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Free money, from our perspective, is the best kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3770.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3771.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: And do you have any sense yet on how many teachers will be interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3775.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you think that you will have to deal with too many people applying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3980.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was just looking at last year's numbers, at least according to the DESE report, and we had 39, 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3988.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's a good increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3991.856s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that we had a drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3993.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't gone back and looked further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3995.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there, I mean, I haven't looked through this report since it's just right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4002.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a particular area where we're seeing a lot of, I mean, that's what, nearly 200 students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4104.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4107.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just on that point, I believe we were at our charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4109.979s">[Ruseau]</a>: So being steady makes sense because we can't exceed the charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4115.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: although I thought the charter cap might be a few students over 395 actually, so that would be surprising and lovely if we were under the cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4126.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, the smaller the number, the better for us, but that would explain why we have been steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4133.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't quickly find the charter numbers, because it's the DESE website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4138.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: Enough said on that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4304.964s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4307.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4308.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is a new format of this report and I just want to say bravo because it's very nicely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4314.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4318.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: Please make sure she receives our thank you, because this is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4321.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5140.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since you're bringing up the reading, you know, and in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5144.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: The samples that we have here, I'm looking at them and I'm wondering, considering the state of reading in the United States, it doesn't surprise me that a student took two hours or more to do this if they are frankly a typical second grade reader or third grade reader, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5169.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: So does this test understand that a vast number of students aren't able to really read at grade level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5175.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is there an expectation that the students can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5180.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just really confused by scoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5183.707s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5184.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a reading test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5186.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5187.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, how do you answer what you know if the student has to read something for which they're not capable of reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5193.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're gonna get the answer wrong if they ever get through the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5199.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just confused how this can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5325.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just one, forgive me if I've already said this, but the reports that the teachers have are student specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5334.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6318.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6319.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6321.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6324.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6327.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6328.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo, current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7985.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the motion as amended to include disability in the sentence that includes race, gender, or bullying, it will now say race, gender, disability, or bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8007.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, Mayor Longo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8040.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8083.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: We already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8086.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: I already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8185.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just realized that in the announcements, the rules and policy subcommittee meeting is this Wednesday at 4pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8192.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll be picking up the wellness policy related to recess, often called the recess policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8199.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to include that for anybody watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8202.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the notice was posted today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8205.292s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8363.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8365.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is something I may have asked in the past, so forgive me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8370.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that we're not Cambridge, for instance, but there seems to be in some districts that each building has a really a data person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8381.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I, I know we don't have that, but when I think about, and this is nothing to do with the caliber of teachers or anything like that, but a lot of teachers, my guess, unless they're the math teachers, statistics may not have been their strong suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8397.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8400.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: In the absence of having a literally a warm body always there to help them understand the statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8408.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: How are we supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8411.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, are we able to support them is really the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8420.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there going to be an ask in some way maybe in the budget to figure out how to support that because when I'm listening to this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8425.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like I was, I was a math guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8428.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, I have to admit I haven't done statistics for, I don't know, 20 something years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8437.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: If I got all these reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8442.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: It would not fit into my day and would not fit into my planning period to figure it all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8449.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how are we supporting the teachers that are not the math, I'm sure the math teachers are just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8455.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: maybe some of the science teachers, but what about everybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8537.66s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've heard from a parent about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8779.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: in math, and I realize Faiz is not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8782.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8783.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just, you know, math, I will say, more than many other subjects, you know, requires that you did the last thing before you can do the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8793.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I think about learning loss or gaps, you know, if you're, let's, I'm just picking this randomly, because I cannot honestly remember the details, but if you're in Algebra II, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8810.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: the map that this test is given and a concept that is a definite Algebra 1 concept is a student doesn't know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8821.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're still sitting there in Algebra 2, and that is not on the syllabus, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8829.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not going to be taught this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8834.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Will NWEA map highlight the fact that there's a gap, and then how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8840.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is our expectation of teachers who like they have framework for algebra two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8846.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's not an extra month somewhere they can carve out to teach something that the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8852.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of the kids didn't learn in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8858.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure this is a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8860.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's always been a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8862.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that because of the pandemic, this may not be just like occasionally you'll have a student in Algebra 2 who somehow managed to not know a concept of Algebra 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8872.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in fact, you may have a third of your students who don't know a concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8876.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do teachers manage that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8878.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: And does this testing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8880.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: help them figure it out real fast so that the teacher can sideline what they were planning to do and get back and teach that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8956.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's really helpful to hear that because, you know, there are plenty of parents who think more testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8962.823s">[Ruseau]</a>: And sometimes I'm that parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8966.504s">[Ruseau]</a>: But at the same time, we're not in a regular school year, we probably won't be for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8972.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: 10 years, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8974.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's, you know, knowing that there, this can help us find these gaps with precision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8981.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, nobody wants to just teach the whole school year over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8984.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: The students don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8986.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: We probably can't legally even do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8988.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, but figuring out what, you know, little Johnny was on Zoom and for that month, there was something else going on in the house and little Johnny wasn't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9002.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, there's no way for the teacher of the next year to have any clue that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9008.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9709.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9835.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9838.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: feel like I'm going to just ask a couple questions for which you probably don't have the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9841.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, we talked about MCAS scores, which for the thousandth time, I'm not a fan of, we do know that we were referring to the students of Massachusetts, and we mean virtually all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9856.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: What I don't know is the NWEA database for which they decide to decide that those are the nationals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9864.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are they using, I'm assuming we're not getting some of like, they're not getting, showing us a like district numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9872.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I realized like district at Bessie changes it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9876.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I doubt very much the communities that are in the like districts for us truly changed every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9884.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what I have no idea is, you know, does, who's buying NWEA and feeding their database, is it historically low performing urban schools or is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9897.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know the wealthy Western Winchester's that are buying it, who's buying it, who's this data source because I think that sort of was maybe what member Graham was trying to get at was the national norm mean RIT in kindergarten for ELA is 136.65.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9915.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we were all to just get together for a year and sit in a room and do some research projects, would we all think that it should be 230?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9924.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand the need to like understand how we compare to the state or to national averages and all that stuff and it's it's not that it's not meaningful, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9940.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike with the MCAS, where we know when we see the score that we're referring to an individual student or a district against a known cohort comparison, I'm really unsure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9954.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is NWEA in 80% of the schools or 2% of the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9958.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those kinds of things would matter dramatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9961.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you told me they were in 80% of the schools in the country, all my questions that I'm asking would just vanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9966.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: If they're in 2%, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9970.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: would make me think that the national norm means nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9976.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I'm asking this question realizing you might have to perhaps come back and get an answer later, but it seems really, really important to me to understand whether I can trust that these nationally normed things mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9992.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm glad we're above them pretty much everywhere, by the way, that's great news, but who are the them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9999.734s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10058.203s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10060.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: The appendix is not everything you had, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10063.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you made that very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10067.039s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also understand, based on some of the slides, that you had to do work to make them to hide student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10075.725s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't have the right to see individual student anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10082.99s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I look at, for instance, I'm just the one on my screen, grade level district mean score in ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10089.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I would, if it's not a week of work, I don't know how good the software is at spitting out endless reports, but, you know, I'd like to see that by a few different things, like by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10105.787s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10109.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10115.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10117.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like it when the answer's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10119.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7527.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could we get that presentation sent to us, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7530.727s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you so much, wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8197.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8199.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: I brought my kids to the old playground when they were little and even did skate, not on skates, but it was definitely skating material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8207.756s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really, I did get to tour it and it is, while it is, when I toured it, it's far from done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8215.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is shocking that it's the same,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8219.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: footprint really that's sort of the thing that's hard to really wrap your head around is that the old one felt frankly small and this just feels so big it's like a like a TARDIS or something from Doctor Who it's like how on earth did you get all this in here doesn't feel crowded it's really amazing and I cannot say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8243.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: enough good things about it, and I'm super excited for the stuff that's yet to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8247.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that there's a lot of stuff that looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8254.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: tar color, but that's going to be colorful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8256.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can't remember, I think it was Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8261.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pelequin who explained the way the color differentials will help those with low vision and just the thoughtfulness around things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8271.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because when you first glance at it, you're like, there's all these opportunities for kids to fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8274.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: But of course, we want kids to have the opportunity to fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8278.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: The old playgrounds make them so safe that they are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8283.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: can't possibly skin a knee, but also they're boring is thankfully becoming a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8290.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cause like I drive through Belmont every day and they have a beautiful playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8297.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: It looks like architecturally like gorgeous, but it's all brown and it is all that style of nobody can get hurt in our playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8308.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure it costs probably more than our playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8311.228s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I'm glad we're not going there and that it's going to be a place the kids can't get enough of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8316.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my kids are way too old to enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8318.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll just go by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8320.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: But thank you so much for all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8321.971s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really an enormous number of people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8326.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I want to thank the mayor and and the residents for funding it through the CPC because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8333.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: It wasn't the cheapest thing we could have done is an understatement, but I think our kids are really going to benefit from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8341.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: And not just the kids at the McGlynn, like my kids didn't go to the McGlynn, but we went there anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8347.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that the kids of the entire city are gonna drive there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8350.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's parking, especially on a weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8352.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9272.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9274.792s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have no questions other than, is there actually a bet whether we can be the fastest at this project in the history of the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9282.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I mean, we had documents done before we begun, which has to be unusual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9290.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm excited by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9294.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham's ability to keep the gas pedal accelerator, excuse me, pressed to the floor in a way that amazes me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9305.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I feel like nobody's getting run over, which is also kind of impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9308.432s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I wanted to thank you for that because every time I come to a meeting, I can't believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9313.137s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're done with that document already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9316.679s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are less, we are, what, 30 days into, we have 172 days, I think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9325.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, so we're doing good, but I'm excited, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9678.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's hope it's never that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9680.407s">[Ruseau]</a>: The city council approves the municipal budget with the final allocation for member public met for public schools, one review and approval by the city council phase eight school committee of review and approval of final budget target date June one through June 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9757.141s">[Ruseau]</a>: E, if a public hearing is not required, a regular or special school committee meeting will be scheduled to approve the proposed reconciled budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9765.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then four, the final budget will be posted to the Medford Public Schools website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9770.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a few definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9825.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9828.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can I just speak on it real quick first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9830.993s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, most of this is actually stuff we already do, especially the budget preparation stuff and the planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9839.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, those are sections that are for the administration, so obviously any changes, additions, subtractions that they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9849.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: I obviously I think we would be happy to consider those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9854.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: The dates are were difficult, because the city council passed the budget ordinance that says on March 1, that the mayor's office will tell the school district, or I don't know if it tells city council or the school district, what the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9871.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: potential allocation will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9874.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we had to really, the dates on this really had to be planned around that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9881.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, to pretend we don't get a number when we get a number doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9886.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's why a lot of this stuff is sort of backed up and that March 1 date is so important in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9893.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, one of the things in this current budget cycle that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9899.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if everybody agrees, but I certainly think many people in the community would want to know is like when we had our presentation of the budget last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9910.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: time or the time before, and we we cut 2.2 million and still had 2.7 million left to figure out how to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9918.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I understand why we did that, because, like, it was probably very hard to even wrap our heads around where we would make those cuts, but it's June, and if we still had to make those cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9932.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: that's not a lot of time for the community to respond, for us to respond, for staff to be like, all right, we've just decided we're laying off another 50 people, they got families and mortgages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9944.139s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I felt it was really important that when we get an allocation, a projected allocation, that we take it completely seriously, and that we have a document that says, if that's our number, here is how we'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9959.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: We still don't have that now and I understand why and I, I actually support that, because this gap was so phenomenally large, but in a normal year even if there's a gap, we need to be able to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9973.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is how we're going to do it now we aren't going to put names and say these people are getting laid off all the way back in February that would or March that would make no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9982.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, how are we going to get from what we need to what we think we may get the public should know that we should know that, and not a few weeks before schools out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9995.296s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that was sort of my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9997.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: my point in all that and then also telling the city council I mean the city council has traditionally received our budget book that we get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10006.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's, that's the, that's the recommended budget from the school committee that's not what will actually happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10015.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that if we have the budget request, which is that this is what we would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10022.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we only get that projected allocation, this is what it will look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10027.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: And a letter that says, here's how we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10030.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: And no we don't like it, but I think that they need that for their deliberations because I know the superintendent was in the hot seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10038.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, it's too big of a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10042.779s">[Ruseau]</a>: The budget is too big to just drill you for an hour or two even, and think that that's enough, that's that's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10052.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just too much for the city council to actually take all that in, and to get to all their questions really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10062.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is this other thing in here of having the budget hearing, possibly up to three times, and that is to say, if we are really going to have to make cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10075.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: that are bigger than I just picked 1% because I looked at the math and thought that's, that's still a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10082.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have to cut 1% or more than the public should be able to have a say, just like with the regular budget hearing, which is why we have to have the budget hearing so that the public can say what they think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10095.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that's the overview of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10099.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I apologize for it being so long and wordy, but I just felt like I couldn't, this is shorter than it was, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10228.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10230.798s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, you know, it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10233.937s">[Ruseau]</a>: Phase one and phase two, frankly, are the superintendent's office, and they could have just been called phase one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10241.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, those dates, you know, between October one and February one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10246.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: Honestly, I don't, I don't think anybody cares where and how you have to switch that around so you know the December thing really bothered me when I was doing it because I'm like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10258.32s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like December 31st, well, like it's the holidays or winter break or whatever you call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10264.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that that wasn't a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10267.923s">[Ruseau]</a>: So certainly if you wanna move the dates around or move things in phase one and two around, I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10277.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of this language I did get from Cambridge Public Schools, which frankly, they were the only school system I could find that had anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10287.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody had the same block paragraph that we all inherit from MASC, which essentially says, we'll do a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10295.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: Gee, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10297.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, so definitely that stuff feels very much squishy and whatever you recommend for changes, I'm sure we would be fine with, or I would be fine with, I can't speak for the committee, but that's how those came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10675.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10676.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, in my seven and a half years now, we've done budgets, this will be the third way that we've done them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10684.678s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I started, the way we did them, I mean, it was just the way I've been done, I was new, was that every department head, every principal came before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10697.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: They told us what they wanted, but of course, we're not their boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10702.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: The superintendent's their boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10703.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: So everything that they were presenting, the superintendent already had, of course, like vetted, or I assumed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10711.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it made no sense that we were being presented with something that the superintendent had already said, yeah, that's fine, as if we were going to somehow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10722.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: be a decision maker at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10723.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was informational, but the biggest flaw in that was that, you know, if a department head had like a big spend, they wanted to really do something big with the department and the superintendent after talking down about how much money there was, was like, we can't do it this year, or we never hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10742.756s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we were hearing about those things that we weren't gonna get to do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10749.042s">[Ruseau]</a>: because we didn't have the resources in those meetings, then that could have been useful and helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10754.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that was the first couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10758.63s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then remember Graham got on and that got turned upside down where it was, here's the list of things we would do if we had the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10769.459s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we did that, I think, two years and then we have this pandemic thing that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10775.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, actually, no, I got my time right a little off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10778.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, we had a laundry list of things we would do if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10782.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: And many of those things were not like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10785.157s">[Ruseau]</a>: know nice to have they were things you're like wait the public schools doesn't do that stuff like how are you operating a public school and not doing that which was sort of the whole point was to have that in black and white um and this year we haven't we sort of done it a different way because we just because we knew how big the the budget gap was so a lot of that stuff kind of fell to the ways to the side as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10810.562s">[Ruseau]</a>: We could have done it, but honestly, what was the point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10814.804s">[Ruseau]</a>: It sort of felt like this year, like what was the point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10819.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I forgot what my point was in response to your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10823.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was your question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10838.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: That, sorry, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10839.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I guess part of the problem with that type of transparency is that the, I mean, it isn't really appropriate to think department heads and principals are gonna come and essentially just ignore what their boss said and say, here's what we think that the priorities for science should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10861.966s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the superintendent doesn't agree, I don't think we should hear about it because that's not transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10867.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: We hire and supervise the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10870.613s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if she believes that's not the way to do it right now, or we can't afford it, I think that's not transparent for us, but it's on the other side of a veil that is like etched in stone in the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10887.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10892.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: dig and we can, you know, throw the fishing hook in and try and pull that stuff out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10897.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we will hear from the community and other folks like, you know, science, which is doing great, by the way, but I'm using it as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10905.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: Science has a problem like we did before we bought FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10909.821s">[Ruseau]</a>: And maybe we can push, but I just think having, it really felt like a dog and pony show where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10918.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: department heads and the principals told us stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10922.652s">[Ruseau]</a>: And every year they seem to sort of have everything they needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10925.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it was like two months of committee of the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10930.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was like on top of school committee, two months of committee of the halls, where at the end you were just like, okay, I know what's going on, but there's no strategic anything involved because it's already been decided by the superintendent, which is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10946.551s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10947.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: I understand that desire, but I also feel like getting that desire satisfied is in some ways outside of our jurisdiction, if you will, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4114.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the only other issue is we don't get to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4127.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4127.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: So he could bring in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4143.627s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will say though, a few years ago, I was bringing in folks to $200,000 a year, which is what's kept us afloat in tough times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4339.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: Don't you just remember everybody's name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5482.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: And on top of that, I feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5485.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't remember if it was the Oklahoma school that we saw the video for, some of us saw, but we did go to, I've been to Arlington, I drive by the Watertown High School being built right now, and I drove by Winchester's when they were being built, and all of these schools seem to have something in common, that school is the walls,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5514.599s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there's no integration in nature at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5516.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no, I mean, we have probably more than most of those places because we have those corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5524.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just feel like, while intentional spaces for the classroom do seem important, I just feel like students should walk through the doors of a school building and then get completely encapsulated and start to walk out the doors, like nature grants<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5544.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: climate is getting hotter, but there's no integration with nature at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5549.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no intention that the students are in and out of the building in any way in any of those schools that I described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5558.313s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're very much in the clinical field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5562.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know if we have any good examples<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5571.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5597.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: share if I can say, are we going to build a place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5965.69s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5966.29s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5967.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cultural stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5975.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what your conversation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5982.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, Peter, we're going to get cows here, you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6357.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6360.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not sure where it's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6369.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, Medford does lack a lot of community spaces, and we're not going to be able to supply enough for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6376.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, it's about, like, how we segregate portions of this building, many different segments of it, even at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6386.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because, like, those girls down here, if we find a place to put our troops, we can't do it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6404.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: turn this into, you know, that open campus idea, I don't really know much about it because it's a lot, but the idea of the school community sector or education, community education, for all of these, there's so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2675.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yes, member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2676.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, Marilyn goker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3221.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5593.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5595.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: Around the invitations to parents, caregivers, I suppose there's no way to confirm receipt, of course, and spam filters and all the other things that get in the way of our actually getting to an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5611.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: Assuming that we're not inviting 1,000 people, can we include in the process to investigate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5620.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: any affirmative declines to understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5624.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I think that's something that, you know, understanding why we've offered a service, you acknowledge that we've offered the service, and then you say, no, I think it would be helpful to understand why so that we can perhaps in a future year, it'll always just be useful information in general, because we don't have a lot of opportunities for that kind of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5646.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: but really understanding why people would decline it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5649.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cause I'm sure that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5650.918s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, maybe they're away on vacation that week or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5654.244s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there are plenty of reasons for which we can do nothing about and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5658.928s">[Ruseau]</a>: But are there reasons like transportation or they have to watch a sibling during the day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5667.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are the kinds of things I think that could be useful information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5670.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as we think about students that have been identified as needing services, making sure they can get them is super important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5678.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1677.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1677.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I want to feed everything from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1682.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I think about the community involvement, several people have mentioned that we are somewhat limited by our own experiences and knowledge, well, we are completely limited by our own experiences and knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1699.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1700.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike the community, we're going to go around and look at lots of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1705.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: The whole of Medford is not like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1708.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I think it's, well, to be expected, reasonable to think we have an outsized impact on what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1719.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I mean, obviously, I'm not serving the community, and I look forward to the professionals that kind of do that, doing that, because, like, I don't envision them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1729.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: providing us with a list of things to do with this building, this room, like, they're going to be providing, in my mind, a set of values, what's important to them, and have feedback from there to create a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1746.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: But to ask the community, will be self-selected, it will absolutely be not representative of the community, that's 100% not an option, to somehow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1758.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: generate a vision, I think it will be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1764.214s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just don't see that as something to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1767.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's sort of, in my mind, I mean, I'm on this committee, because I have a search for new things that I need to make sure we don't stop talking about, stop thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1778.584s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I assume everybody here was on here for people had to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1791.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: but they're not investing in five to seven years of their lives getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1798.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I really do care very much about what everyone else is saying, but like me, I went to a one-level school in Borough of New Hampshire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1807.846s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was a regional school and built in 1970 or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1812.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: And to me, that's what high school is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1815.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: I sure hope we don't do that here, but until we start this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1821.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what you're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1823.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1825.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1827.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then sharing what we're experiencing with those tours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1832.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, we saw this thing, like, far like a van, these tunnels that are like as big as this, from the ceiling to the first floor, going through the library, provide light, natural light, everywhere the library came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1848.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's kind of weird, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1849.861s">[Ruseau]</a>: But also, like, never seen such a thing and thought it was cool to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1855.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I'm excited for all of these visits, because I suspect we're going to find in every visit things that we want more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1864.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we're like, let's not do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1867.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4145.143s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can tell you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4147.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's one word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4148.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4149.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3095.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3097.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3099.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3100.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't really know much about city year other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3109.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: recipient of services or however you would describe that, I think that's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3114.372s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm curious, I did read the entire memo and I'm wondering what the stipend is for 45 hours of labor per week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3125.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll ask my questions and then I can go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3128.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody has answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3130.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll just get them all out once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3133.69s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do we ensure that they're not doing any work that is currently covered by any of our CBAs with our union partners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3141.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can't take union work and give it to non-union members, and I'm concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3151.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: wonder what of the $100,000 is used, what percentage of that is used to pay the employees, which I don't, I don't know if they're considered employees since the word stipend is a very specific legal thing used, which I typically dislike that word stipend when people are gonna be working full time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3170.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then I'm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3175.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I've read a couple of articles, it seems to suggest that City Year folks spend a significant amount of time talking about City Year while they're in the schools, drumming up support for future City Year participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3186.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I guess I would ask Member Olopade, how did you hear about City Year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3189.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: If I could ask through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3723.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3725.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are these fellows considered employees or, and therefore getting, you know, Social Security benefits and all that stuff contributed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3752.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, so they would be paying both sides of Social Security, Medicare out of the 27,300.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3760.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that, you know, when we think about most minimum wage workers, they are also getting the employers paying for all of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3773.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, you do pay the employer's share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3777.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, so they're, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3779.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was a little confused on that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3781.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as for what they would do in the school, and I realize these are early days in this conversation, but I've heard people say they could be substitutes, they could help when their paras are out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3794.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: And those are, well, I don't actually think substitutes are part of any of our CBA, any of our contracts, but I am deeply concerned that we're going to have them fill in for work because we can't find employees to fill jobs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3811.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: that we have posted in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3813.704s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, that's just not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3819.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: You can't just have non-union workers taking over union work, regardless of why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3826.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, and I don't think that's, that's certainly not a question for you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3829.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: Roberts, because that's a superintendent issue and perhaps a school committee discussion as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3840.579s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so $100,000, a team of six at $27,300, I mean, that's not even covering the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3854.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where does the rest of the money come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3871.101s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5021.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5117.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5117.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I appreciate member and tapas point about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5121.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: Adding anything an additional new expense at a time when we're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5126.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: About to have a discussion about our budget and the layoffs that are involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5130.473s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's an exceptionally good point and a little embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5134.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't get to that one already, but, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5138.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5140.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: I feel like there's significant critical questions we need answers to aside from the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5149.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think knowing that our union partners are okay with this is not unimportant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5158.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the deployment, I feel like a plan should, even a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5164.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: generic, you know, wireframe plan of what this would look like without, obviously, you won't have the information about which teachers raise their hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5175.276s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, you're not going to have that happen until after we're already like, yes, we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5181.118s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, after school, that sounds fine, except that they can't be the after school people that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5192.458s">[Ruseau]</a>: replacing the other adults we would want to have and expanding afterschool for one year so that next year we are going to be in crisis mode because we are going to have fewer people to staff it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5206.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's one thing to be on a wait list and to be like, I wish I could have gotten afterschool care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5212.313s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then it's another thing to get it and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5215.829s">[Ruseau]</a>: 12 months later, be told you had a spot, you don't have a spot anymore because we just can't recruit enough people to fill those spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5224.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that concerns me about any times we talk about expanding after school is that I feel like after school, the staff spends an enormous amount of time trying to find staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5236.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5238.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: that's just a permanent problem of afterschool programs everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5242.334s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the idea of having more space is delightful, I think, especially if you have a kid and you need it, but I don't know that we want to make a bed of crisis that we're gonna have to all lay in a year from now or a year after when the city year has not continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5264.148s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5267.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do just have some, you know, those are my big concerns and I feel like I would rather have answers before we approve continuing with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5275.237s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we could get those answers at another meeting, I think that would be a better time to motion to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5284.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, I'd like to motion to table it to our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6270.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I didn't get a second, thankfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6273.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, the housing point is one that's quite moving, frankly, for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6279.011s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, this is not gonna be money that's going to be in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6286.354s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, because our budget is being presented tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6288.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, there's an assumption that we're gonna find the money in these revolving accounts, which we have all of the totals in the actual budget presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6297.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although those are the end of last fiscal year totals, not the current totals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6303.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: If Mr. McHugh believes he can find the money and if he can't find the money, if the city can perhaps provide the money out of the quote free cash, you know, that's all, you know, somebody has to write the check and it's not the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6318.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not cutting anybody else to do this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6324.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, as member Brantley pointed out, I mean, it's like, this doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6329.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: I remember in top, I believe, I'm sorry, I forget who said it, but, you know, my concerns about union work remain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6340.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not particularly pleased with the amount of money that these folks will get paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6345.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe they'll be the lowest paid workers in the district and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6352.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I also can't ignore the needs in the afterschool program, which is only a portion of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6358.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we've talked about that extensively, but there's the rest of the day, they have to be doing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6365.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that if we can have answers to that at a meeting in July, I would be moved to the point where I could agree to approve this, just because I do think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6380.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you know tonight, then folks can perhaps get into the July one hunt for a place to live rather than the August one, which is the exact same time when all of the college students in Medford are, the Tufts are all looking for housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6396.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: So my concerns remain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6400.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like us to have a meeting to discuss them, but I would be moved to a yes vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7035.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7036.191s">[Ruseau]</a>: As I understand this statute, this will simply mean that you all can start having conversations about doing this work, that absolutely no sharing of resources occurs when we agree to this, that if we want to share any resources, those individual decisions will come to the school committee and the city council, and we will vote whether we agree or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7057.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7085.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7086.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you're suggesting that this paper allows the superintendent and the city to get together and decide that maintenance will now be a city function, that utilities won't be charged to the schools anymore, we'll just have them charged out of the schools, that we'll move any of the functionalities, information systems, IT department, those that you and who else gets to decide that that is now just a city function?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7131.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: So facilities being the obvious one, and you've mentioned it, and I think everybody assumes that that's what we were talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7138.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we approve this, that means the school committee no longer has oversight of facilities, as is the case in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7146.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: During the pandemic, the school committee lived through hell because they did not open, the city did not open the schools because the schools were 100%, facilities-wise, were a part of the city of Somerville, and that is still the case today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7162.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have any maintenance challenges, the rational thing for the community to do is to bring up the school committee, at which point we will say, sorry, not our job, call City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7177.234s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just want that to be clear that that's the situation we'll be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7181.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if we are unsatisfied with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7184.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: how the city is doing the maintenance in our buildings, which I have no reason to believe that's the case, that would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7189.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if that happens, our only option would be to sever, to end this entirely, abruptly, just decide that no longer the city has any responsibility for facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7202.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that how you understand this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7261.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7261.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my last question is, so this person will not report to the superintendent or has supervision within the school system, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7270.018s">[Ruseau]</a>: If our director of facilities was reporting to the director of DPW or whoever it would be, director of facilities at the city, that person would be doing their review, the contractor would be a mayor, signs the contract, not the school committee or the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7472.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll let me tell you what I wrote down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8666.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8667.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm trying to keep them brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8669.832s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to comment that in the message from the superintendent on the third paragraph, it does say that we've fully funding programs and positions formally funded with our ETRA grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8679.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I believe there are still a couple that we did not continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8682.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8694.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8695.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to be sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8698.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: And thankfully I put tabs, which this is a lot easier in person to do this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8707.791s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wanted to comment on page seven under federal grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8712.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: I see this sentence in here, which made me very happy and I just wanted to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8716.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says, when these grants are received during the course of the fiscal year, the actual grant amount received will be presented to the school committee for acceptance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8723.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: I am very thankful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8725.745s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have not done that in the past and it doesn't change anything financially, but it does keep us more informed about what's coming in, where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8738.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8742.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8743.214s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't mean to shush you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8745.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: I came across wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8746.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8748.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page nine, the Bedford Family Network, there's a negative balance of $70,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8751.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8751.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: Quite surprising and wondering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8758.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where does the money come from that goes in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8761.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: And how are we operating the Family Network?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8820.866s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8822.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page 11, under the funding summary, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8828.621s">[Ruseau]</a>: Last sentence of the first paragraph says with this in mind, the superintendent submitted a budget recommendation of 76.6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8836.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then it says increasing the base budget by 8.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8840.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that is the 8.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8846.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know where you get that from 71.2 to go up to 76 and get 8.2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8848.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the 76 included the $2.2 million savings plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8858.12s">[Ruseau]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8858.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8859.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8865.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8867.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm a little confused by, so we have on page 12 that we had five elementary teachers that were included to be cut in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8880.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I go across the actual schools, I come up with, and then it says that we restored three, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8895.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that should leave three elementary still cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8897.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I go through the rest of the document, I show seven cuts to elementary teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8906.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I can tell you exactly where they are, and you can tell me if maybe I'm misunderstanding them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8917.172s">[Ruseau]</a>: On the McGlynn Elementary classroom teachers, I see two teachers are cut, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8955.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, well, then that form on it seven minus four is three so minus four three yes i'm I feel like that makes sense now, thank you, I do what I really appreciate this listing of positions and then the little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8968.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like know at the bottom about like minus to reduce by to tease or whatever I think that really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8975.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: was very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8977.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although this issue of adding things after the budget is approved is always the wonkiest part because like for all, you know, I went through the Medford Public Schools budgets going back into the 80s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8990.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: This year, last year, this year, earlier this year I went to the library and there were a couple missing but almost all of them were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8997.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8999.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, being on the school committee, I know that this is the plan how we're going to spend money and has, in many regards, is not a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9009.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, at the highest level, it's a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9013.309s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, all the positions we have in there, and we couldn't find somebody or we didn't actually have the money, like, it doesn't tell the story that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9022.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: most people rationally would think it tells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9025.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, last year we added kindergarten teachers after the budget was set, because we do that often when kids just show up and register.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9036.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm just wondering if you have recommendations, not for today, but for, you know, whether there's a policy recommendation you could have, where there's some kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9048.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: a document or something that we can create that will help the future school committees and maybe the community if they're so interested to really know, okay, this was the plan, this is what happened, was short of my memory and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9063.914s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, the people in the room, it just disappears into history as this unwritten thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9069.696s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really a problem because sometimes I, you know, many of us have had arguments on online about like, well, that's not what really happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9077.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, they're looking at the document we published that says, this is what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9081.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we might know that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9083.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: But how do we communicate that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9085.722s">[Ruseau]</a>: And yeah,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9161.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9162.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9166.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Of the 18 positions that are still cut, assuming that number is right, and if it's not exact, were all of those positions actually positions with people in them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9220.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: But most of them did have people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9257.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can probably figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9258.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's only been so many hours in the budget, but some of them would have blanks in there, which I think implied that they were open, like there was not somebody in them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9270.742s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not going to ask for a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9272.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: I asked for too many hesitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9274.475s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do want to, and I don't know if this is just something for the payroll folks or HR to fix, but on this, under district-wide instruction and assessment, we have coordinator of world language, coordinator of art, and coordinator of music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9290.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we settled their contract, they are no longer called coordinators, they're called directors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9297.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: obviously their pay is correct and all that other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9299.676s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that for a newbie reading this, you'd be like, oh, coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9303.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I thought there was a director and just to synchronize those things where appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9310.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are the only three that I found where the title change would actually be necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9314.883s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that one of them were not funding anyways, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9318.965s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9328.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know there was a very long, not long, it wasn't terribly long, there was a memo explaining the kindergarten teacher situation and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9340.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a lot to that conversation, but I just want to repeat something I think is what I'm understanding is, you know, when we have to do layoffs, we have to do them in a certain order according to the contract in that at the Missittook, because the staff was newer, they were the folks who we had to lay off, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9372.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I'm not necessarily all of them, I'm not suggesting, I mean, the non-professional status staff are by default.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9466.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9468.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's just the point is it's really quite complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9491.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I'll let some other people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9494.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a motion to make, but I'll wait on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9496.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9715.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9716.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9719.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to motion that Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay addition of K teachers to lower class<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9737.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: in order to lower class size, increase after-school capacity, and to fund recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9747.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the substitute pay, that's the end quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9752.584s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that in some communities, or maybe even many or most communities, substitute pay is actually part of a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9758.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: In Medford, it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9761.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that that is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9765.506s">[Ruseau]</a>: both good and bad, if it was in a contract, maybe it would be higher already, but because it's not, we can actually be, if we can secure more funding and we can target it that way, we can increase our substitute pay to whatever we want, well, assuming we can find the money, to really solve what is a crisis, I think, in some places where there's just no substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9790.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, whether it's a pay problem or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9795.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, the way our lives are created and oriented nowadays and the cost to live in Medford and all the other things makes it hard to find people for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9804.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when there are some number of people doing this work and they have choices, Medford at one rate and then one town over, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9814.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: 100 yards away for dramatically more money, it's kind of hard for anybody to rationally choose the worst pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9822.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9824.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to repeat it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9830.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9831.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham will work with the City Financial Task Force on behalf of the School Committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9847.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9856.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm gonna drop it in the chat so any member that wants to, likes to read can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9861.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: Once I figure out how to do this for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9997.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just suggesting that might be the language you could use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10013.775s">[Ruseau]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10014.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay, addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, increase funds available to additional funds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10038.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: to increase stipend pay in negotiations with our union partners, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10056.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: How many things can I do at once?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11309.182s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, only that you must need a drink of water now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11314.557s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was looking for any kinds of typos and stuff like we had in the last one and I think we made it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11320.961s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, so this was the work of the strategic planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11324.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: We kind of outlined the important dates and I was tasked with taking those four or five little notes and turning them into a policy and they are lining up with the city's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11336.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: budget ordinance, which is that March 1D isn't actually listed there, but that's why some things have to be done by the 28th of February, but also lines up with our budget policy we just approved a week or two ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11349.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11376.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, those lists really are to prioritize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11381.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, in my mind, each of those lists should be individually prioritized, which is actually the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11387.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then if we're asking for funding from the CPC, then even if it's something that could be covered under net school spending, it would be in both lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11400.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: items will be could be in multiple lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11402.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay yeah I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11403.49s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah so these items not eligible for Community Preservation Act or net school spending would be any major physical upgrade or something that's more than $150,000 that CPC doesn't cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11419.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that these lists is also a way to communicate to the well aside from to the council but to the community it's like here's the real list<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11428.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: of projects that we can't do, which is whether it's because we don't have the capacity financially or infrastructure of staffing or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11462.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11463.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're going to send it and we're going to, it'll be added, I think it goes to the city clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11468.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the council wants to pretend we didn't send it, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11473.436s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously they can't just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11476.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: write a check either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11477.487s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's for their budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11521.658s">[Ruseau]</a>: Number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11587.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: We actually have to do it the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11589.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have to approve the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=224.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: Capital Purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=229.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=340.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=347.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to table, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1940.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask, that we get the field trip form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1946.556s">[Ruseau]</a>: and all that Corey details at a subsequent meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1949.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is happening before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1960.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just I'm not suggesting we don't let them go, but we do a policy requiring that form to be approved before the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1968.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll pretend that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1971.169s">[Ruseau]</a>: about the policy for a minute, I guess, but just, you know, let's not put these forward without including all the proper paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1979.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we don't have that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1988.766s">[Ruseau]</a>: we haven't had time to approve it because this is our first meeting and the field trip is next week how does that work policy-wise just curious i just honestly don't know remember um so i mean if the field trip was planned before the end of the school year for the beginning of the school year then it could be submitted then i would say that we should have a special meeting with a one-item agenda we can be in and out in 10 minutes but we we do have that policy because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2014.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I don't want to rehash history, but that's why we do require that we approve the form with, you know, the nursing looked at it and the nursing has signed off on it and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2025.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure that will all happen, but we are also supposed to give the sign off on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2031.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's how I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2033.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, of course, you know, this could have come up literally a week ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2039.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: so i think you know we don't exercise special meetings that often we just save them for like emergencies but i think we should use them more often um for things such as this so we can comply with our own policies there's a motion for approval by member reinfeld seconded by member brandley all those in favor all right all those opposed motion passes enjoy um the field trip to our 23 students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2556.624s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2557.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Were you fully staffed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2565.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a problem not many people probably have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2567.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2569.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we survey whether people are going to participate, do we ask them why if they say no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2586.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just sounds like something that might be interesting just to make sure there's not something that you could do differently that would increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2916.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: The number's growing so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2918.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you talk about why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Title III pays for all of this, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2955.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2956.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3683.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3684.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: I noticed the comment in the teacher feedback that four days was fun, but the two weeks we did before was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3692.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is this two weeks we did before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3754.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3755.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so Desi's paying for the meals and the time in the school and all that stuff, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3763.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they're not covering transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3767.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that, you know...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3770.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: that doesn't mean that we couldn't, I mean, you know, we don't have lots of money laying around, but that doesn't mean we couldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3777.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when the invitations go out, I'm assuming there's lots of people who do not accept the invitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3786.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we asking them why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3787.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is that useful information for planning in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3850.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you're saying Gessie didn't even come out with the grant early enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3857.86s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3871.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4669.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to thank all of the staff and teachers that have spent their whole summer doing all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4676.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of this stuff happened in places that weren't the coolest facilities either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4679.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's one thing to spend your summer working with kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4686.007s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's another to do it when it's too damn hot in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4689.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you to all of the, too many people to list, but thank you to all of this wonderful staff and the administration for making it happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4899.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could you just send line CC to the school committee when the October 1 report goes to DESE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4907.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's not gonna look terribly different, but it's good to have, you know, I keep these reports, but I also know that there are so many of these reports that they're not the important reports, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5141.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm putting it on my list for the budget season because options are the ever nightmarish redistricting, which is not a permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5153.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's sort of like in my mind, it's like a 10 year solution because people who think that they need to go to a specific school will simply buy a house in that district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5162.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: It will be a painful experience for people who bought a house near a specific school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5169.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: knowing that that's where their kid was gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5171.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then they go to register and they find out that's not where their kid's gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5175.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, every district that has ever redistricted, it's not a good experience for the process, but it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5188.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: In my time on the school committee, we have moved programs all over the city because for one reason only,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5196.001s">[Ruseau]</a>: the Roberts was too full or the Brooks was too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5199.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were never doing it because it was right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5202.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was always, we were just too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5205.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, some kids ended up on buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5209.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: The newcomers program has been all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5214.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: making decisions that are right for the kids should be how we're approaching these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5218.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that does also mean we're going to have to all experience some pain in redistricting if that's what we decide to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5226.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm adding it to my list, my short list of things for us to consider budgeting for in the upcoming year, because it isn't like we just get a map out and just start drawing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5237.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: You hire a company, a consultant who is specialized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5241.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are consultants that specialize in exactly this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5244.591s">[Ruseau]</a>: and they figure out things like what happens to busing and like you draw the line here and all there's these three new babies that were born this week on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5252.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like they do all that hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5256.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think we're long past the need to do that because we have to do what's right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5264.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the Roberts is literally, I mean, the scenario of like a bunch of new people just move in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5274.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: to that district that we're in bad, bad situation in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5281.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because if we decide those new kids have to go to another school, well, they might live right beside the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5289.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: And meanwhile, people who are really far from the Roberts, right at the edge, they're getting bused to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5297.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not tenable to just avoid this very challenging and politically very unfun experience, because as you said, we're maxed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5308.205s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5309.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, not that I don't think the principals all do great jobs, but we have principals making about the same amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5316.93s">[Ruseau]</a>: One has 177 more students to manage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5321.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: and I don't think they should get paid differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5323.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we should resolve that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5325.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, well, I guess we'll be talking about that more soon because we can't keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5332.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5463.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5465.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe that there's some members of the public who want to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6267.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6270.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6271.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate that you tried to get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6272.992s">[Ruseau]</a>: It doesn't sound like B2Q actually wants to give an answer to the question I asked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6278.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: After 15 years, my question was pretty straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6282.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any reason to believe that when this equipment must be replaced, that the electric replacement equipment in 10 to 15 years will be any cheaper than it is today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6292.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's going to be a day when we're not going to be able to replace this stuff with...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6298.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: with fossil fuel based equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6302.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I look at expenses like the electrical upgrade, the infrastructure upgrade that's gonna be required if we chose the electrical option, well, that number will get bigger and bigger every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6312.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, that's a lot of labor and big equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6317.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: So every year that number will continue to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6319.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in 15 years, I don't know, double, triple, whatever it will be today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6324.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: um on top of inflation so um i mean my estimate you know is that we are looking at just being fine with an additional 185 000 pounds of carbon emissions by choosing the gas option over the electric option<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6346.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really wanted them to do an analysis, like just pretend electric rates don't change between now and 15 years from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6353.188s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pretend the gas rates don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6355.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we can't know those two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6358.571s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what would it cost to operate these two pieces of equipment over 15 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6363.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that was too hard for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6365.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: Based on the response, it sounds like they didn't want to be bothered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6368.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because this sentence here, frankly, is really obnoxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6373.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6376.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: uh sorry where's that sentence essentially they're saying all that we should care about is cost that that's what they're saying they're assuming that the only thing this committee this community and humanity should care about is how much it costs and if that's the case we should all get some coal going because coal is probably cheaper than everything else um so i i don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6400.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: find their answer particularly satisfying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6403.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that in the future we can decide that we're not going to accept their answer until they actually give us an answer that answers our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6413.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not inappropriate for this committee to want to know this information as we are about to take a vote to pollute an additional 185,000 pounds of carbon into this atmosphere for one boiler at one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6428.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6431.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's absurd that they don't see this as anything other than a cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6440.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how else to be more ticked off about it than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6445.044s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll let my colleagues ask their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6538.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6574.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6577.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: This just dawned on me when somebody mentioned, I think you mentioned kitchen and electrification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6583.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6584.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6585.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we did buy stuff that we have to send back because our electrical infrastructure can't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6592.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you know, we when we decide we want to replace the Brooks's kitchen equipment with induction everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6602.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: we will be paying this expense then because we won't be able to do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6607.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's kind of like every project that is around electrification, we will either decide that we're just gonna, well, I guess we can't do it, it's too expensive, but it's like the same big expense in the middle of all of those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6621.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And which year we decide, which budget do we decide, when does the city ever really have enough money to do that stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6629.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6630.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are big questions, but we're never going to get to our goals around carbon emissions if we just, every time we have the decision, we're like, well, we can't afford it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6642.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're never going to afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6784.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, we do need to approve the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6788.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: capital planning, that the capital purchase, I'll make the motion to approve it because they need a boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7889.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: know i'm just reading an article um from this last year about worcester and their um they they got no bids so they decided to purchase at least 13 buses and that's sort of the trial of bringing busing inside i think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7910.233s">[Ruseau]</a>: The elephant in the room here is that we want workers to work for $20 or $25 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7915.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for every parent that has ridden on a school bus for a field trip, you know that is utterly insane because you couldn't pay me enough money to ride on a school bus every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7925.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: No way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7928.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we want to solve the problem, and I don't think solving the problem is expecting Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies to find these magical people to work for, frankly, not very much money for terrible hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7944.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they're not 40 hour a week jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7948.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, a solution that I'm going to ask you, if you know of districts that have brought all transportation inside, do they really run into these problems or do they have to pay their workers living wages with a pension and healthcare?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7961.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I don't know whether the bus companies do all that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7965.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I do know that they don't pay them enough, but do districts that have brought this stuff all in house and have a union and all that other stuff, do they have these problems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7993.442s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7994.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's just, I don't know either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8047.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I certainly don't think we can do that for this upcoming contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8050.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: That would be impossible, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8054.509s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know that it's a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8056.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, the efforts that Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies are going through to find people to work in these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8064.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I heard, I don't even know who I had the conversation with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8067.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think it was you, but like during the pandemic, all these workers went to work for Uber and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8075.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not interested in coming back to a job paying less that is, you know, I won't say worse because, I mean, obviously lots of people who drive buses probably enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8088.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would not be one of them, but they all went someplace where they got paid even more with a lot more flexibility and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8097.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thinking we're going to get them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8101.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: if we keep paying them the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8103.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the same conversation we have with afterschool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8105.575s">[Ruseau]</a>: We really wanna solve the afterschool, and it's 50, it's 60, it's $70 an hour, and you can raise your eyebrows, but do you wanna solve the problem or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8113.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're not making new people, so we gotta get people to quit existing jobs to take these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8121.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really basic, simple math, it's capitalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8126.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we want to solve these kinds of problems,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8129.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: they can be solved, but they are not gonna be cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8131.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: The taxpayers have to decide, do we wanna solve the problem or we just wanna complain about the problem because the two cannot, or just complain about how much it costs because you can't have both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8145.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, you can, but you don't get a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9293.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to, you know, the bathroom work is great, but we have all been to many bathrooms outside of schools and somehow the uric acid is not what you smell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9304.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would like to hope that there's regular maintenance that can keep it from being where the grout has absorbed all the way to the board, the blue board in the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9316.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: because that's not actually what happens in most bathrooms in most places you go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9322.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've been to bathrooms in other schools like at Shore and they don't have to tap people in to do that kind of work because it's cleaned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9335.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9356.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9487.291s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just, Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9491.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: Apparently, this was news to me because I don't follow this level of detail with food, but the USDA has regulations on the number of calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9501.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have a friend who has a son at the high school who's like, you know, a man, an athlete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9510.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9511.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: the same number of calories have to be given to that person to somebody like me or somebody who doesn't need many calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9519.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really kind of bonkers that like 850 calories, it doesn't matter what on earth you as a human being need is the way it has to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9529.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9530.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: just found this out i found it rather unfortunate but that's those are the usda rules i guess and um i think it's crazy frankly i mean some of these you know i was not an athlete as you probably could have figured out but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9545.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: if I was like 850 calories is a snack for some of these kids and that's supposed to be their lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9553.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just think it's really unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9555.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10067.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10068.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to warn everybody that the rest of the Title IX policies which we'll be receiving in the coming weeks make this look like a paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10077.765s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of them are like dozens of pages long, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10082.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: So maybe we'll want to think about how we get through that in a meeting because we do have to at least read it once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10087.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, for this one, this is one of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10091.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: many policies that we have to, this is when we're updating for Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10097.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: All of our other Title IX policies don't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10100.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's put the past in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10103.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: They should have existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10104.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so I don't, I think the policy speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10108.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there is a number of cross-references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10112.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Almost all of those don't exist in our policy manual right now, but those are the ones that are coming before you in the coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10119.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10180.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10185.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you ask if it was at all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10188.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10191.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10194.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10195.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10196.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10216.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: yes um we this is a relatively new thing for this committee the consent agenda i believe we just created that last year and i believe these are additional two types of approvals or things that we just approve so um i think it was the last meeting our meetings in june where we're like oh shouldn't this just be in consent agenda and i think everybody sort of thought it should so that's why i'm suggesting we amend this is there a motion on the floor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10270.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of the amendment to BEDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8056.596s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to thank you for bringing forward budget transfers to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8060.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8061.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I wish we could figure out where the extra echo is coming from, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8067.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8078.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8080.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8305.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we already motion to approve the Cummings grant or did we already approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8441.797s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Soyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8442.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9382.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dr. Cushing, before you step away, though, are there schools where there's no charge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9745.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I would recommend that whatever community standards are developed that first of all, they're written down and then they're passed by our attorney because, um, students do have a first amendment rights, although it's slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9758.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, and it can't just be a matter of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9761.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: You don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9762.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: The principal doesn't like it because that does a pass muster with we are the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9768.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: the teachers of the government, we are all the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9771.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that is, most people are confused on what the first amendment means, but the government interfering with what can and can't be said well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9782.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: having varied rules about what can be said based on what the content is is not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9789.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, somebody wants to do a rainbow flag here, that's probably fine, but then you go to certain places in this country and the same rainbow flag might get you, you know, expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9802.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's an example of the need to be very careful here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9810.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: some things are offensive to some people and they're not to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9813.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it is not going to be up to the school to decide what's offensive and what's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9818.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a danger here I think that is deeply concerning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9826.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: and uh i don't know that we have thought that part out it can't just be that the principal doesn't like it or you take a vote of administrators that those those are not options so having clear explicit guidelines ahead of time not afterwards ahead of time where you can say here are the guidelines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9850.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: And from the guidelines, any rational person could say that's in or out of bounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9856.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's how you avoid a First Amendment case here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9859.568s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm going to guess that other schools that have the painting thing have already been through this, probably didn't get it done beforehand and then had to deal with the consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9871.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we really should find out what other districts are using for guidelines, the exact language and see if...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9878.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: we like any of that, because that does worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9882.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'll just eat up huge amounts of resources and time and lawsuits, God forbid, but lawsuits cost a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9891.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm very worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9893.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm also...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9897.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about, I'm not concerned about the $75 to paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9900.995s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9904.637s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that it was mentioned that we would set some money aside to help kids that couldn't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9911.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: But as some of you have heard many times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9915.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, not all, there's a lot of new members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9917.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So most of you haven't heard a lot of the things I've had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9920.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: But by the time you're in high school, if you don't have the resources, you're not asking for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9927.259s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9929.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: When you spent your childhood being aware that you don't have the resources, you've learned to just stop asking because that's not for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9937.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's for the kids with the resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9939.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm opposed to charging $75 to park, $75 to paint,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9948.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm still open to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9950.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10432.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10435.361s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's another relevant to the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10441.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: But having funds available for student activities is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10448.524s">[Ruseau]</a>: is a budgetary issue that, you know, right now it's everybody just raise all the money you can, any which way you can, rather than just providing you a reasonable amount of student activity money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10459.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that that's an issue we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10464.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully, if the overrides pass, we can put a small amount of money, small budget-wise, not necessarily small if you're a student and you want to use student activity money, but money directly into that rather than just relying exclusively on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10481.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: using all your free time to raise money, which I mean, all of us were teenagers once, some of us very recently, and you probably could do something else with your time other than raising money for your favorite clubs, like doing the activities in the clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10497.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I hope we can get to that point where we're not expecting that of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10503.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10526.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10527.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to waive the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10550.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10551.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this, as I mentioned in our last meeting, is one of many policies I'll be putting forward to deal with the Title IX changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10560.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10561.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10562.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX changes that came from the Department of Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10565.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: recently and our professional association provided templates well they provided the language um and so this is one of many they they come together and sort of as a set but rather than making us have to pass um 45 pages of policy in one night um they're broken up so i assume everybody can read but it's on harassment and retaliation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11023.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also, you know, I was talking to a friend who lives in Cambridge about this question, and it was interesting because she's a highly engaged voter, an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11035.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: She had read the actual state packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11038.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a little booklet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11041.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: The booklet that comes out and explains it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11044.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: And she had read it, and her impression was that it removed the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11049.298s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11050.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't received mine yet, so I haven't read it yet, so I don't know what the language is exactly, but I think it's such an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11056.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: We, first of all, in Massachusetts, cannot end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11060.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: If it's not MCAS, it has to be something else, because the federal government requires that we do this testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11066.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: The federal government does not require that it be a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11072.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: we could not, the state could not end MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11076.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if they did, they just have to institute something new and give it a new name that would be MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11083.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think anybody who's afraid that we're going to stop being able to compare Medford to other districts, if that's something you want to do and you want this one test, you'll still be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11095.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it does mean, and you know, it's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11099.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's talked about as it's not a common thing but it does happen where students are excellent students they are engaged they get great grades but they are for whatever reason just incapable of passing this test they cannot get a diploma in this state which is insanity teachers assess their students all the time and if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11125.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: professionals with masters and PhDs think that this student is, is competent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11130.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that isn't good enough, rather than a test that was written by, frankly, not educators in, you know, some offices somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11141.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: And why did Desi move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11144.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know where, I don't know where they moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11147.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: that they're the wrong people to determine that this person is ready for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11152.185s">[Ruseau]</a>: And before that, before we had the MCAS requirements for graduation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11156.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: we were still at the top, Massachusetts as a whole, was still at the top for education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11161.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not like the MCAS made us number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11164.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were number one before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11166.294s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think the harm that the stress, the pressure, the teach to the test, all that other stuff, it's just negatively impacting education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11178.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not exactly news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11180.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm very supportive of getting rid of the MCAS requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11184.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11346.03s">[Ruseau]</a>: I need a giant screen, but then nobody will be able to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11352.655s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11412.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Mayor Longo-Kern has abstained due to conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11498.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11503.051s">[Ruseau]</a>: I actually submitted two policies and the other one got dropped by accident because somebody thought it was the same policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11511.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the next agenda, there will be a different one, which is around use by students and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11543.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the amendment is to add to the listing of the products<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11551.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: to include, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11592.936s">[Ruseau]</a>: They wouldn't be prescribed a pouch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=3.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the family yes, I'm a Graham yes, never doubt that yes, never about it, yes, never and so yes, ever so yes, Maryland occurred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=9342.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are these percentages on this slide?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11763.051s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11764.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think I know the answer, but I just want you to confirm the English learners are not the letter name, letter sound inventories is they're not there because of they have a very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13342.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve the rate card.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=13397.758s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=230.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=230.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm Paul Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=233.533s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm on the school committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=235.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've been in office since January of 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=240.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I am not going to repeat everything that was just said, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to have a budget where we are not just cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=248.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have literally just cut budgets forever, at least for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=254.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the number goes up, but that doesn't mean it is actually going up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=258.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=260.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to perhaps having a budget season where we can talk about doing more with more and it's exciting and I look forward to hearing the questions and trying to answer them as best I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=277.054s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1118.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I would just add to Jenny's rosy outlook is that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1129.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have, as Jenny mentioned, in 2020 when the budgets were level funded, we said goodbye to 40 something people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1140.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when people hear level funded, they often think of their own budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1146.383s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're not gonna just buy anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1148.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: But unlike your own budgets, we have contracts with our union partners and those are still legally enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1156.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1157.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we negotiate with our unions, it's a negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1162.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're partners with them, and we often talk about the annual increase, the cost of living increase of 2.5%, 2%, 3%, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1173.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's a misconception that that is actually how much the increase cost for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1179.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's just use the teachers as an example because I brought that contract up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1183.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we give the teachers a two and a half percent increase, give, we negotiate, it's not a gift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1191.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: They, each of, except for the teachers that have been here the longest, most teachers are moving up a step, meaning they are a year more of service, and they're getting much more than 2.5 or 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1204.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: In fact, I just did the calculations, and in 2023, a Step 10 teacher, so a teacher who had been here for 10 years, that same teacher, one year later, in 2024, would make between 12.9 and 13% more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1220.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: That is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1222.486s">[Ruseau]</a>: nothing weird, that's normal in districts across the, in any contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1227.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: You have another year of service, you get paid more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1231.652s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the total for that one staff member, 12 or 13%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1236.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not the 2.5% we negotiated with the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1239.577s">[Ruseau]</a>: So Prop 2.5 really is a problem because even if we stuck to 2.5%, nobody could ever get more than 2.5% in our negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1251.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: well, that's fine, but everybody's, other than the people who've been here the longest who kind of max out, everybody else is getting more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1260.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that's part of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1263.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a problem, it's the way it's supposed to work, but it's also a sort of a misconception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1269.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as for what else would be cut, you know, the 2.2 million or whatever the number was that we didn't even,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1279.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: get to discuss in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1283.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's like a whole elementary school of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1287.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a couple of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1290.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not an administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1292.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a school committee getting no pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1295.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not anything anybody here can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1300.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1302.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we never even could get to that conversation because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1308.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's doomsday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1310.294s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how do you sit around and talk about, OK, so which elementary school are we shutting down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1316.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we getting rid of all of the arts, and all of music, and all of sports, and still not coming to $2.2 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1323.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because that is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1326.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: So what the cuts would look like, frankly, we don't have an answer that's very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1336.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, a bloodbath sounds very, very melodramatic, but it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1343.978s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not an exaggeration if we don't pass these, what kind of cuts we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1350.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have my own thoughts on where on earth we would make such major cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1357.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: My personal preference is that everybody hurts, not just one group of students or one level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1363.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have to do this, because Medford votes against it, then I want to make sure the pain is distributed to all kids and families, because it's not fair to just focus on one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1376.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: one group of folks, everybody should have to suffer equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1383.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's, it's dark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1385.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's very dark, but that's also reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1404.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanna interrupt and say that that is based on our current pay scales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1410.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not, we're negotiating with our parents, we're negotiating with our teachers, all of those things are gonna go up as they normally would and should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1419.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that is an absolute low ball number based on the data from June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1425.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I expect it to be higher if we have to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1986.263s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will add Jenny covered a lot of that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1992.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of the less sexy stuff is we have one HR person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1998.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one payroll person for 1,100 employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2002.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: To put that in context, Shore Collaborative has two HR people and is a teensy, teensy fraction of the size of Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2012.597s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so while those are just two examples of where we need to add staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2020.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are things when we finalize a contract with our union partners, it takes months often to get them their retro pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2030.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: Months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2032.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because it is an exorbitant amount of work for one person to do, who's also doing weekly payroll for 1,100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2042.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's, you know, we have like the city, you know, Jenny talked earlier, maybe it was Zach about how, you know, the schools, every penny we get, especially in this spring, it was by telling everybody else in the rest of the city, you can't have any of your requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2061.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, we have departments with like the one man standing and just like the city, we have some departments where there's just one person left and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2072.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, if it takes months to get your retro pay after you finally, you know, everybody's celebrating, we finally got that contract done, it's bad for morale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2086.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like an edge case, but these are the kinds of things that drive the culture of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2093.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, from a staffing perspective, the distrust that we can successfully do anything is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2103.123s">[Ruseau]</a>: definitely, in my opinion, heavily influenced by the fact that we lack enough staff to do to execute on many things that in other organizations would just be so mundane and boring, it would never be a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2119.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the most simple thing is really, really hard because there's one poor soul responsible for two or three jobs, it just isn't good for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2131.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: It isn't good for the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2133.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's just many, many examples where what we can do to improve things, I mean, busing, it's a long list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2144.454s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, I think probably the most important thing is the school day, as Jenny mentioned, and we don't know what that will really cost exactly, because we have to negotiate that, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2157.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're gonna ask people to work more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2160.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: So like anybody else, if your work day got longer, you'd expect to be paid more, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2760.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, Jenny already covered it, so I don't need to repeat it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2763.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2764.488s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2925.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, so I've been on the school committee for seven years, and while running for office, I heard that Medford had this massive administrative crew of people, vastly more than every other district around us, as is the usual assertion for every claim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2943.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it turns out that, of course, that isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2947.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: And while we do have two assistant superintendents and a superintendent and a director of finance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2954.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2956.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: What other districts often have, if they don't have as many assistant superintendents, is many, many, many more lower-level administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2968.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: In some districts, every single building has, by grade level, a person responsible for curriculum, for math at fifth grade, at this school, a person responsible for science at this grade, at this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2985.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have none of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2987.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2988.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: So our administrators are doing the work of, frankly, so many people, it's sort of, again, it's absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2997.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the work they're doing is not work that's optional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3002.81s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of times there's enormous amounts of reporting and regulatory stuff that they're involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3009.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: They execute on all the things the school committee asked them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3014.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we just do not have a heavy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3018.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: administrative, we don't have a lot of administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3021.982s">[Ruseau]</a>: And administrators, also people have very different ideas on what the word administrator means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3027.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have an administrator's union, which has our directors of curriculum, director of science, director of math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3036.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my entire time I have been on the school committee, we have had people doing double duty, sometimes triple duty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3045.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: covering three different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3047.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, that's just not normal in other school districts that are even remotely better funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3056.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when you have one person who's responsible for humanities, social studies, and English, and is covering foreign language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3067.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: First of all, that person usually will have a specialty, which, you know, maybe that's English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3071.392s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how much are they able to really do in those other disciplines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3076.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we have great teachers, and often that is the only reason we have continued to have a quality education in Medford at all, is because our teachers are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3086.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the lack of anybody above,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3092.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Providing any kind of leadership has often not been the end of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3097.029s">[Ruseau]</a>: But things change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3098.31s">[Ruseau]</a>: The state changes the guidelines for what is required for social studies curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3104.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: And these are constantly changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3108.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when you don't have any leaders to focus on that, because the teachers are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3112.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3115.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you don't have any of these administrators, then we don't have the ability to get that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3120.002s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have been working on the science of reading and that's been an assistant superintendent, a director of humanities and a whole host of other staff and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3131.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not, it's not like a five minute part of their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3134.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like a huge, huge effort that's multi-years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3137.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are not only not administration heavy, I think we are administration light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3146.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, my inclusion of administration is having enough people in HR and payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3152.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think of administration as the people in central office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3157.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think people have very different ideas of what administration means, but we are definitely, we don't have anywhere near enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3164.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we need two more assistant superintendents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3166.574s">[Ruseau]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3166.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do I think we even need another assistant superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3169.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3170.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need people working under them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3173.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: that they can delegate to because they are completely swamped with incoming mandates and crises that are normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3182.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're normal parts of running a school system that can often swallow up anything that they were already in the process of actually doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3192.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3194.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3489.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I'm itching to answer the question about short staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3492.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since the schools are short-staffed, are we seeing high rates of burnout, turnover, and could we use these funds to help improve retention in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3499.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3500.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: We lost our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3504.947s">[Ruseau]</a>: not treasurer, I forget, the controller to Somerville, making 20 grand more to do the same job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3512.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: The catch here for that is that because we're missing so many positions, people leaving for better pay, or even if they aren't leaving for better pay, they are leaving for dramatically less work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3530.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't mean to suggest they don't want to work or that they're lazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3533.563s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3534.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of these folks that are leaving are working absurd numbers of hours for the pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3541.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's absurd numbers of hours regardless of the pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3543.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: People want to actually do something other than just work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3546.458s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when we lose somebody like a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3551.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: Controller, she didn't just leave with the knowledge of what it's to technically do the job of the controller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3557.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: She left with all the other knowledge for all the other stuff she had been doing because there was nobody else to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3564.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that vanishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3566.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: We hire a new controller who comes in to be a controller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3570.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then there's just this gigantic gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3574.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that has happened many times in my time here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3579.122s">[Ruseau]</a>: And replacing that person with a better salary, which you often have to do to even recruit somebody,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3588.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: It solves the problem of that slot, but you didn't get what you had before, not even close, because that person rarely was doing the job that is their job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3602.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: They were doing much more and it's a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3608.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when we talk about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3611.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: improving retention is often a very expensive endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3615.981s">[Ruseau]</a>: It isn't just about people giving people a raise, which sometimes that is an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3619.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is about adding whole other people, more people to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3624.767s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's always a dramatically more expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3627.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you can give somebody a $20,000 raise, that's a lot cheaper than buying another person for 90,000 or whatever hiring, not buying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3635.315s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3638.837s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of these problems are truly very expensive to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3643.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's just what it costs to, you know, our business office is understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3648.907s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've talked about that so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3651.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: But as a school committee member, you know, right out of the gate, I had all kinds of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3656.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: that could never be answered and have not been answered in seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3660.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3660.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because if we had a modern financial system, somebody would go in, they'd write some little report and click print or email me an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3670.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Without those systems, it's weeks of somebody going through multiple systems trying to figure out what's that over there, what's that over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3678.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm not exaggerating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3679.722s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like we have things, there's a monthly report where we're legally supposed to get every month, a hires and terminations report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3688.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: All the districts around us get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3690.531s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know about it because of the Shore Collaborative where I'm the Medford School Committee representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3695.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody gets it, the Shore gets it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3698.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3699.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3699.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we don't have a modern system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3700.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our HR is not connected to our payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3702.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is getting that report worth paying somebody for 40 or 80 hours of work every month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3710.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3713.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this burnout issue is a really important one, but it's also very expensive to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3720.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is not just a matter of looking at how much does a controller make in other districts and say, oh, we're going to pay them that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3727.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: they're still gonna burn out because they're doing multiple jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3730.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry to beat that one down, but it's been seven years of complaining about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4345.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4346.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4346.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm with Jenny on the, you know, it's so long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4777.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4780.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4782.636s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are undoubtedly 500 other questions that a group this size has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4789.679s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that I certainly, and I'm quite sure the other elected officials here, would be happy to make ourselves available to sit with you one-on-one to answer your questions and to get into the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4801.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: As Zach and Jenny and Matt alluded to, some of these things are sort of outrageously complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4808.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: and not very well suited to this kind of a setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4814.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: And really, I will make myself available to anyone that wants to have a conversation about understanding something because a lot of the stuff is really, really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5138.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5138.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=389.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think I found it, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=390.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll put it in the chat for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=765.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, Member Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=768.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: The FY25 for the Brooks water heater, didn't that come in at $267,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1250.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1254.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1256.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Peter, do we know if that included handling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1260.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, these would be networked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1262.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: So do we know if that included figuring out how we're going to network at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1309.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly like to be involved in any conversation on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1313.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep, happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2538.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I just don't want to disagree with Peter, but we are definitely, you sort of almost got there where I was going, but we're just cutting future kids, not the kids in front of us now, is what we're doing, as if they don't matter anywhere near as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2557.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's really, I do think that treating it as, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2568.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a, what's the word I'm looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2570.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a values proposition here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2574.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: By not cutting from any of the kids now, everybody, the kids, the community can think everything is dandy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2581.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we end up in full-on crisis when there's nothing left that can be done, which is where we are in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2588.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think, by the way, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2594.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, it's been a couple of years it's been a couple of decades at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2597.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yeah, I'm sort of beating that horse but it is, these are these are decisions that I think very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2607.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need to make and understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2611.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: do things do cost more over time, even if they don't get more expensive, you know, exponentially, at a minimum, they're gonna get more expensive from inflation and all the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2623.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, we've got to stop saying no, and we've got to, if we need a million dollars in maintenance costs a year, and we have to choose between maintaining our facilities or taking services away from kids, we need to take services away from kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2965.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only other thing I see in the bottom list that I think it would behoove us to have as soon as possible is the electrification assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2977.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, I have no clue how expensive that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2981.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like the kind of thing you do at one elementary school and you can copy and paste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2988.691s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the middle schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2991.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I don't actually think it makes any sense to consider electrification at the high school at this moment in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3002.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for the other schools, I think knowing what it would cost so we're not dealing with a break fix scenario and don't have a real understanding of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3015.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: the gulf between what an electrification option would be and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3022.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: going with gas or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.247s">[Ruseau]</a>: So not $800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3442.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's like project management as well or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3618.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3621.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3622.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm looking at the policy, and you may be going right next to this, but we are supposed to create four lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3630.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, we have one list all done, which is the all projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3633.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3636.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, when we pass this, you know, one of the lists is projects that are eligible for Community Preservation Act funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3646.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: net school spending, and then things that are not eligible for either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3651.898s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just wondering, who has the expertise to decide whether something is eligible for CPC funding or CPA funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3757.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I don't even think, that's not really an opinion, that's fact kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4212.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I think we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4219.519s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to continue the meeting to a date yet to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4233.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4234.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: To November 19th then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4235.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: At what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4239.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Five o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2503.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2507.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of these fixtures, I mean, we were talking about one part per billion, 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2514.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we have a sink at Medford High with 967 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2524.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: The thing is, is that all of the really bad stuff isn't at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2529.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the worst two are at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2534.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: 235 parts per billion at the Andrews, 180 at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2541.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there are 176 fixtures over 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2549.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm obviously very interested in mitigation, but I really hope that how we are here and why we are here doesn't get any kind of sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2563.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: No sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2564.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2566.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2570.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, 967 parts per billion, I bet DCF would take a kid out of a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2577.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2578.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like that's like, well, I can't do that kind of math at this hour that quickly, but hundreds of times over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2587.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: the maximum amount before you have to shut down equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2592.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to the results of the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2596.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: I look forward to all the very graphic detailed reports explaining what was snaked and looked at and where every fixture that does get replaced, I want those fixtures saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2607.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: need to know where they came from, how they were purchased, how did we end up with them, if it was a fixture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2613.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously if it's not a fixture then we got to find the root cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2616.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't want it to just be we replace the 376 fixtures, it costs a million dollars or whatever it costs, and we throw them all in the dump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2627.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: There needs to be answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2628.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, for the Medford High stuff, the answer is that's what it was when we built it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2633.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for everything else, I want to know who received funding to sell us a piece of equipment that was not necessarily allowed at that point in time, because I just can't believe that these levels are a result of purchasing the appropriate stuff and putting it in front of children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2656.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do have a question about whether or not it makes sense for the school committee to draft a policy on required testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2663.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: One of the things that's very unclear right now is like, what does it cost to test every fixture in our whole school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2670.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, is it $50,000 a year or is it a vastly bigger number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2676.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And without that number, it feels like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2679.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, my gut test everything every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2682.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if you tell me it's going to cost a million dollars a year, then my gut starts to feel a little less comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2689.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I understand that this testing we weren't paying for, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2696.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2697.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, if we can get an estimate for what it would actually cost for us to do this on the regular, I would like to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2706.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of how much on the regular would depend very much on the investigation as to how we are here and why we are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2714.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we find out that this certain fixtures were purchased and they had lead in them and we replaced them, then it makes sense that we don't have to test those fixtures regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2726.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: But those schools are 24 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2730.015s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm looking back at the data on the state's website there are a few from 2016 or 2018 but pretty much nothing ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2738.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I want to make sure we're never, we don't leave a future school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2742.387s">[Ruseau]</a>: and certainly kids and staff to discover that they've been consuming this stuff for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2751.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's, I don't know if I have a question, but those are my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2755.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5002.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Make a motion to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5033.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5035.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of policy GBEB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3645.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: to go up on that point of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3647.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at the last budget we just passed for the schools, you'll see that there appears to be a $3.5 million increase in transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3656.565s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at our transportation contract, it's actually, we pay them more per year than our last budget's total transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3666.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: because it shouldn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3668.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, in the past, because our budget wasn't big enough, we would not be school committee, but, you know, the finance people and the superintendent would get together and they would just like start erasing numbers and making them smaller to get down to a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3682.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because by law, every penny we spend in our budget has to be tied directly to where that penny's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3688.973s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no wishful thinking in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3691.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it looks like our budget for transportation went up $3.5 million this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3696.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: It didn't go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3697.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: It went up a little bit, like 80,000, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3700.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3701.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: The rest of that money, previous years, was just not on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3705.016s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then you would not hire some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3708.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: They take some money from these accounts that aren't really for transportation and pay the bills that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3713.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you have no idea how much it costs to run this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3718.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the first budget in the time that I've been on the school committee where the transportation line item says what we have to spend for transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3726.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a very simple example because it's such a stark jump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3729.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there were budgets since I've been on the school committee where we have full-time special education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3736.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: permanent teachers, and if you looked in the budget, their salary on the budget says zero dollars, because it wasn't enough money, but we weren't gonna fire them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3744.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we just kept them in the budget with a zero, and then on July 1st, we started paying them, and we didn't pay for other things that we needed to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3753.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the budget has always, in my time, in seven years, this is the first budget that actually makes any sense to anybody reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3761.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a level of transparency that I'm just thrilled by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3766.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really hard because it does mean that if you decide you're gonna be transparent, next year if transportation is 4.1 million, you can't just suddenly decide it's gonna, well, we'll put three there so we can keep these teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4755.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our next question, we discussed this a little bit in the beginning of the panel through the remarks offered by our three panelists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=75.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=76.413s">[Ruseau]</a>: Uh, member Brantley, I believe member Graham here, member and Tapa absent member Olopade here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=87.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Reinfeldt here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=89.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Members, so present Maryland, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=166.135s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=167.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is a very long policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=170.036s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would never draft a policy of this length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=174.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's so long that we might be the only people to ever read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=178.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: But this came from our professional association and came down from a set of lawyers that they contract with regarding Title IX changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=189.424s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX has sort of been batted back and forth through each of the administrations that we have had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=195.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: White House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=196.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is the Biden version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=199.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully, we don't have to go through all of this again in the next couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=205.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is one of many policies that we have been going through related to Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=211.054s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the grievance procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=213.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anybody who wishes to file a grievance through Title IX would follow this procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=220.659s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is a lot of preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=224.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then there are step-by-steps, who has what rights and when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=230.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will admit that I lack knowledge about prior versions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=235.408s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I can't really speak to what changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=240.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=242.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, if you, I didn't even ask you, but is there any big, giant change that you feel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=249.78s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is it just such a wholesale change that you don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=293.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=293.532s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=295.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: So not having the knowledge of the previous one, it sounds like really fleshing out the areas where there was always litigation, because it's like, well, what does that really mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=305.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=306.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=307.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have an update of this size, it's good to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=310.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello, member of family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=314.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, I attempted to do an AI summary and I failed because this is too big for the free AIs to ingest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=328.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I wasn't about to pay for a AI subscription just to be able to do it on this one giant policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=335.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=338.877s">[Ruseau]</a>: we could go through it page by page or section by section and just like this is what this section means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=346.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: I personally have a strong dislike of the idea of reading it because I did time it if we were to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=355.581s">[Ruseau]</a>: a Siri or AI read us the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=358.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's an hour and 27 minutes just without us stopping or having questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=366.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was with a pretty fast voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=368.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm hoping nobody here is desiring that we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=372.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other thing I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=376.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll know in the policy, and this is something new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=378.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've never put this in a policy before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=380.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: At the very end, there's a statement that I think we might want to put into other policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=385.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says, updates to contact information of school staff identified within this policy may be made without school committee notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=393.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think it's bad form to have in your policies, like the names and phone numbers of individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=400.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in this case where it's sort of part of the point of the policy is that that's all there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=406.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: I thought this was a good workaround.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=408.024s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are not reviewing this policy every single time a staff member retires or we hire somebody new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=415.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's sort of the outlier for how the policy language is drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=423.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the 10-mile diversion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=434.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=446.948s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brandley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=450.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=452.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa is presently absent still, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=459.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=459.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=460.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=461.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=461.778s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=462.038s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=549.908s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=553.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that that language went to the lawyers I forget the law firm that ma SC uses, and they.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=560.228s">[Ruseau]</a>: expanded upon and translated it as much as was actually needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=564.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't read the DESE, I mean, not the DESE, the Department of Ed Language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=569.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if they simply copied it and stuck their name on it, I wouldn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=573.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: But yeah, this is, I did not make changes other than updating the contact information, replacing the district with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=583.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also, there were a few places of punctuation and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=589.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: Frankly, there were some typos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=592.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so other than that, I did not change the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=595.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although, of course, malegal perspective, a comma can matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=599.436s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was very cautious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=601.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I use Grammarly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=604.059s">[Ruseau]</a>: Grammarly has a lot of recommendations to make this thing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=607.701s">[Ruseau]</a>: I did not take any of them other than where a comma was necessary or not necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=616.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was clearly just a mistake in the drafting of the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=620.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really didn't like the format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=622.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=625.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, I felt uncomfortable really making a big change because it did come from lawyers and because Title IX is such a gigantic, complex thing that I don't fully understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=637.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=655.555s">[Ruseau]</a>: So would you like me to share the screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=662.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I think that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=699.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just realize you can't see me shaking my head probably because I have this text up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=703.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't have anything on the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=741.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: Interesting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=744.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=746.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm searching too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=747.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so there's 26 instances of the words sex discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=758.028s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's 43 of sexual discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=760.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will say that it is not the only thing in this document that I have similar concerns about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=769.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't actually know technically if there are differences between the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=772.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: They seem like the same thing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=787.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, I'm fine with a fine and replace sex discrimination with sexual discrimination if nobody has any reason to disagree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=834.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=836.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: We will completely mess up the formatting to add a few characters anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=855.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham, are you looking at the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=861.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm on page three to page... Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=868.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=869.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=869.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=870.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=873.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, definitions, I don't think they're particularly consistent, but I don't want us to have to engage lawyers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=913.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I could just kind of give like quick go through the steps process real quick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=919.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=920.901s">[Ruseau]</a>: So starts out with who may<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=924.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: file reports, and it's anyone, which I think is interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=929.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: It doesn't have to be the victim or whatever the proper term isn't, according to the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=938.77s">[Ruseau]</a>: How to report the discrimination is in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=945.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are not steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=946.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=947.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, this organization of this document was a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=951.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's internal reporting that's related to employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=958.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is the district response to the report, which, of course, the district will respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=965.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are five<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=969.431s">[Ruseau]</a>: things that the district will do promptly and confidentially, contact the complainant, inform the complainant of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=985.057s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't really know what the point of number four is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=995.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=997.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: The complainant will have, it will be explained to the complainant what the process is for filing the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1004.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next we have filing itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1008.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is the actual process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1013.245s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who may file it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1015.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: A much longer version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1016.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: This document is very good at repeating itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1020.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a much longer version of who may file the process again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1028.61s">[Ruseau]</a>: in longer words, more words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1039.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did it say step one somewhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1040.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: It did, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1041.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1041.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: So step two is the consideration of supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1046.702s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the complainant and the respondent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1051.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step three is written notice of the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1075.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: For the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1093.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, there was a section up here about, what was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1102.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: Was it up here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1158.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: Shall I continue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1161.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the hard thing is, of course, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1164.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the hard part is, of course, without specific examples, it gets really, this is not easy stuff to draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1173.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so those are the written notice, what will be included in the notice, there will be a statement for evading retaliation, of course, submitting false information, all the things you'd expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1198.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step four is the consideration of whether to dismiss the formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1207.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there are some mandatory, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1216.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1223.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Even Grammarly didn't notice that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1233.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1234.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, step four is about whether or not the complaint is subject to mandatory discretionary dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1240.903s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the district cannot identify the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1249.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Respondent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1252.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: which is often known as the accused in regular language, then of course there's no way to further deal with the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1268.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is may dismiss, these are the may dismiss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1273.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the person is not involved in their educational programs and is not involved with the district, we may dismiss, not to say we have to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1285.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: if the complainant voluntarily withdraws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1298.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then there's more stuff about dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1301.371s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's really hard to summarize without just reading it, but I'm not reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1317.506s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the dismissal is appealed, the district will do a set of things, notifying all the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1325.927s">[Ruseau]</a>: When the complaint is dismissed, the district will at a minimum offer supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1335.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: Respondent will be notified of the allegations and supportive measures will be offered there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1342.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why is this underscored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1344.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1347.222s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, yeah, so let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1352.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's more just dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1354.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of stuff, but- Six is really important there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1357.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so let me read that one since I can't remember it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1360.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dismissal of a formal complaint for purposes of Title IX nominal exclude the district from addressing allegations under any other relevant district policies or procedures, including but not limited to the civil rights grievance procedure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1374.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: the bullying prevention and intervention plan, that thing, the student code of conduct and or collective bargaining contract, nor will it preclude the district from addressing the allegations pursuant to the grievance process in section two of this procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1392.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Title IX coordinator shall have the discretion to make any such referrals and proceed as appropriate in regard to the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1400.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: So just because a dismissal within this final line has happened, that doesn't mean it's the end, necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1420.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1421.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next step five is the initial inventory deletion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1425.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the details on what the district will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1430.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Standard of proof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1433.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: The burden is on the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1438.911s">[Ruseau]</a>: Collection of evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1440.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1448.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: Presentation of witnesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1453.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll have no, there'll be no gag orders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1461.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: Each party will have one advisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1475.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: written notice to seek privacy medical treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1478.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the district cannot access medical information in any situation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1489.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unless of course they can unless they consent to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1494.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: the investigator timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1497.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: So speed matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1500.125s">[Ruseau]</a>: It always matters to everybody involved in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1503.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's one of the changes that did happen that there used to be a 10 day waiting period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1510.712s">[Ruseau]</a>: Imagine if you're involved in this as the victim or accused or whatever the proper terms here are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1518.056s">[Ruseau]</a>: And once all the investigations are done, everybody has to sit on their hands for 10 business days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1524.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: everybody's going to school, everybody's, you know, it didn't make a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1530.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that was one big change that they made is that that 10 day mandatory waiting period is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1537.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1551.235s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1552.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1553.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I think that for minor things, I think everybody would think reasonable is, you know, same day, a day or two, but for major, major things, I can certainly see it taking many days or longer once there's lawyers and, you know, all kinds of other things involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1581.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then there's, this is the opportunity for parties to access and respond to the evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1589.145s">[Ruseau]</a>: The evidence, there's limitation in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1595.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we have to redact confidential information not directly related to the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1601.908s">[Ruseau]</a>: FERPA is very much still in effect here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1604.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is an override FERPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1610.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for anybody in the public that wants to know, that's the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is, you'll hear school committee members use it when we respond to you about why we can't actually do things you ask us to do sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1626.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: And everybody is prohibited from disseminating any of the evidence for any purpose not directly related to the grievance procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1633.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: So don't take it and go to Facebook or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1639.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is evidence that you have the right to see, but you do not have the right to disseminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1806.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's a little helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1809.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1810.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, if you have any thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2075.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just want to jump in here also that this is the scenario given there has to be a victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2083.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a bunch of students getting in trouble for vaping is not Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2087.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Even if we decided we were going to say just the girls are going to get in trouble and not the boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2095.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: The victim where who's the victim the district enforcing a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2099.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're taking action is we, I suppose we could be the perpetrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2106.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: as a district, but I don't think this policy considers that the district is actually a perpetrator in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2113.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously plenty of Title IX things are about the district refusing to, you know, deal with sports and all the other types of things, but there are victims there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2127.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2134.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, so let me find what page we're on since I've already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2147.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2148.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: Glad somebody's paying attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2149.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so yeah, all right, so let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2178.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2181.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: So next up is step seven, completion of the investigative report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2186.633s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then eight is the parties opportunity to respond to the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2191.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step nine is directed written questions from the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2195.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: So after the investigative report has been sent to the parties, but prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2204.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: The decision-maker shall afford both the complainant and the respondent the opportunity to submit to the decision-maker relevant questions of the other party or any witness, provide the party with the other party's and our witnesses' written responses to said questions, and allow for additional limited follow-up questions from each party in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2226.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: Questions that seek disclosure information protected under legally recognized privileges, such as FERPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2233.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: will, shall not be permitted unless the person holding the privilege waives their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2238.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is, seems pretty standard, not as awful as an actual deposition, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2248.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2258.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there is this 10 days to submit directed relevant questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2262.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: So again, this is still 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2266.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: There was that other 10 days on top of that 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2270.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: It would be hard to feel like things are being taken seriously if we just keep adding two week increments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2275.96s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2286.579s">[Ruseau]</a>: So 10 days to craft your questions, five days to get before your answers are due, another three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2300.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really, it's no wonder things take forever, but they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2305.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, everybody has to do the work and have their rights protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2312.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2313.942s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then step 10 is determination of responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2316.705s">[Ruseau]</a>: Findings are backed by the decision maker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2319.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who's on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2322.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: Joan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2323.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, did Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2323.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we just lose Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2324.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2324.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, no, there you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2325.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2325.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2327.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2327.755s">[Ruseau]</a>: You moved to the top for some reason on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2332.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: Standard of proof, decision makers' findings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2339.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: The determination will be written, of course, and sent simultaneously to both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2349.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's some more very long time frames here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2354.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: Section C, remedies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2357.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is what can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2362.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's the remedies, the elimination of the harassing environment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2375.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is section D, page will be on 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2382.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: Persons doing discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2383.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is about discipline, as you would imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2389.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: However, there is a reference to the two Massachusetts general laws related to behaviors that are attributable to disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2402.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll go into those, because those stand alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2408.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then there's the imposition of sanctions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2414.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: Compliance with the imposition of the sanctions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2427.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so this is sort of important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2429.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if there was a determination that it had not happened, or that it was not, sorry, not that it had not happened, that it was not considered, am I misreading this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2449.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: So what does the sentence, this one mean, do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2467.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2498.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: Does that sound right to you, Jo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2502.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2503.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2507.802s">[Ruseau]</a>: Lawyers, do you know how to make it hard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2546.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2547.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, correct me if I'm wrong, but supportive measures could be quite substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2551.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like if we felt the student couldn't be in the building, we would be offering them another option for how to get an education outside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2558.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not that they just get to come to school and we're like, be nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2564.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not what we mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2565.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: It could be something as significant as that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2722.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up we have, did I finish this section?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2725.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2728.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: Informal process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2730.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's an option to have an informal process if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2739.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: So here's the right words to describe the different people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2743.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, one second, Google is, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2746.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was crashing on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2749.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there is an option to have an informal process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2759.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2760.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is section F emergency removal under Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2766.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: The district may remove a respondent on an emergency basis at any time that the district one undertakes an individualized safety and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2777.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: And risk analysis two determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual discrimination justifies removal and that there is no alternative to the respondent's emergency removal to mitigate the threat presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2794.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: And three, provides the respondent with notice and the opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2801.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2804.074s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully we never have to use that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2806.658s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anonymous reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2812.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is that we may take anonymous reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2817.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see, we can do supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2832.978s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cannot provide, oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2836.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, we can't do supportive measures if we don't know who is supporting, who is reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2844.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see, that seems, I mean, if we don't know who the reporter is, that's different than confidentially reporting, but there's really not much, there's pretty significant limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2864.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: and what could actually be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2866.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anybody want to talk about that one at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2912.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, so next up is appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2915.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's an entire appeals process, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2919.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: Says who to send the appeal to five days after the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2928.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: The decision maker may not take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2932.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, the decision maker for the appeal cannot take part in the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2937.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could not have taken part in the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2942.538s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we do have the original policy as I received it had frankly a lot more decision makers that we have decided to go with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2954.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have some freedom and leeway to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2958.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can see both sides of that, but I'll explain that when I get to that section later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2983.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2983.778s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, can you answer that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3050.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I think what I'm hearing Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3057.927s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen saying is that, frankly, all these people are interchangeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3061.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, if John Bruno was involved, then obviously he's not going to be the investigator or the, I mean, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3073.746s">[Ruseau]</a>: that these are all roles that can just be swapped around to ensure that there's not a conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3079.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we'd have to list every person under every section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3083.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then the point is sort of that people know who to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3088.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think if you were concerned about John Bruno as like you're writing a complaint against him,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3096.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: then obviously you're not going to want him to be the appeals officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3100.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: He also wouldn't be a very good investigator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3104.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so these are just sort of like defaults is how I take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3130.825s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3134.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where was I on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3137.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: Age 15?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3143.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's see, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3145.871s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so we had finished that section there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3149.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Recordkeeping, so obviously just keep records related to this procedure maintained for a period of seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3165.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: I said days, I was confused, years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3173.695s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pretty much standard stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3177.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: Employment agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3179.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is boilerplate stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3183.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3184.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pay is identification of key personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3190.703s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's this section down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3194.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the boilerplate code that I originally had had an investigator at each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3201.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can sort of see the value in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3204.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: On the other hand, if somebody's particularly well-trained in that, then maybe they're a better choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3216.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other part of that that I was a little bit like, so McGlynn is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3221.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: of far away from the Missittook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3225.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that means that Mr. O'Brien is going to be doing Title IX investigations over at the Missittook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3232.375s">[Ruseau]</a>: But on the other side, I also was kind of like, it seems better to have somebody not at your school doing the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3239.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we were to do it where we had really, it would have to be an entire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3247.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: table of like, if you're here, this is who you contact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3251.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think it gets really messy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3254.773s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think, you know, Joan's at the top, so Joan's gonna get the calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3263.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, and this does not preclude an investigator at another school doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3270.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3319.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3328.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this prominently displayed on the district website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3332.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if there's anybody who has an idea of what the word prominently displayed means in legalese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3342.907s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will ask, I'll send an email afterwards to ask that, that if it's not already there that, you know, Joan is listed as the title and coordinator maybe in the about or section or somewhere very prominently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3362.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think on the actual main page, just like right there makes a lot of sense, because that gets very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3368.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want to have the non-discrimination statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3371.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want to have the district educational statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3380.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just gets very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3383.669s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's just my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3385.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are at an hour, and we have sort of been through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3392.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a lot to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3400.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we will have another chance at a regular meeting when we do the second reading, which we will not read also, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3462.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3465.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, whenever I tell people what it's like to be on the school committee, I do talk about that the federal, the state, and, of course, the local, everybody's got their hands in the pie, and nobody talks to each other or cares, frankly, what the other one thinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3481.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we do end up with definitions that can not only be not consistent, but can even be contradictory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3487.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we're just left to sit in that stew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3495.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's tough, especially when you're writing, you know, we write one policy, like the bullying one, which comes from the state house, and we are very specific definitions of, you know, aggressor is the word they use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3510.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then here, there's the respondent, which is like the most mild-mannered version of that probably anybody could ever come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3520.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3522.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we just have to live with the fact that in some policies, we are calling those folks the respondent and other ones that are the aggressor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3529.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think the state one actually has two different words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3536.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3538.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3538.982s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, victim isn't even listed in this one as the act in the definition section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3555.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's hard and hopefully nobody has to go through any of this, especially if they have to go through it in multiple offices because that would be terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3596.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Branley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3601.001s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3609.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Soyes, Mayor Lungokirn is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3641.894s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, um, I know we accidentally did we have 2nd readings 2 meetings ago and then several of us, we already did the 2nd reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3650.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why is it on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3653.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: The 2nd reading has to actually be on the agenda because that's the opportunity for the public to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3658.272s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like the 2nd chance it's not for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3661.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's for the public to be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3663.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh yeah, if you're watching the meeting and you see something discussed and you wanna discuss it, you may not be prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3671.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the second reading I think should happen at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3675.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will be submitting a clarifying rule update to make that clear, cause it's not clear.<br><br>
