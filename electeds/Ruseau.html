    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2826.661s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2829.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just not for this particular one, but I do believe we'll have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2832.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: roll calls for everything with a member online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2841.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2842.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2843.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2844.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Kretz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2859.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2860.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3758.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: No questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3761.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Roussell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3762.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would just like to thank you for the effort to find all this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3767.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Free money, from our perspective, is the best kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3770.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3771.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: And do you have any sense yet on how many teachers will be interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3775.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you think that you will have to deal with too many people applying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3980.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was just looking at last year's numbers, at least according to the DESE report, and we had 39, 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3988.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's a good increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3991.856s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that we had a drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3993.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't gone back and looked further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3995.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there, I mean, I haven't looked through this report since it's just right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4002.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a particular area where we're seeing a lot of, I mean, that's what, nearly 200 students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4104.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4107.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just on that point, I believe we were at our charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4109.979s">[Ruseau]</a>: So being steady makes sense because we can't exceed the charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4115.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: although I thought the charter cap might be a few students over 395 actually, so that would be surprising and lovely if we were under the cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4126.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, the smaller the number, the better for us, but that would explain why we have been steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4133.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't quickly find the charter numbers, because it's the DESE website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4138.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: Enough said on that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4304.964s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4307.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4308.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is a new format of this report and I just want to say bravo because it's very nicely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4314.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4318.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: Please make sure she receives our thank you, because this is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4321.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5140.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since you're bringing up the reading, you know, and in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5144.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: The samples that we have here, I'm looking at them and I'm wondering, considering the state of reading in the United States, it doesn't surprise me that a student took two hours or more to do this if they are frankly a typical second grade reader or third grade reader, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5169.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: So does this test understand that a vast number of students aren't able to really read at grade level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5175.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is there an expectation that the students can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5180.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just really confused by scoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5183.707s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5184.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a reading test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5186.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5187.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, how do you answer what you know if the student has to read something for which they're not capable of reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5193.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're gonna get the answer wrong if they ever get through the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5199.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just confused how this can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5325.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just one, forgive me if I've already said this, but the reports that the teachers have are student specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5334.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6318.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6319.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6321.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6324.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6326.184s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McStone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6327.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6328.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo, current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7985.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the motion as amended to include disability in the sentence that includes race, gender, or bullying, it will now say race, gender, disability, or bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7996.022s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8003.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8006.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8007.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, Mayor Longo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8040.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8083.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: We already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8086.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: I already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8185.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just realized that in the announcements, the rules and policy subcommittee meeting is this Wednesday at 4pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8192.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll be picking up the wellness policy related to recess, often called the recess policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8199.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to include that for anybody watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8202.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the notice was posted today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8205.292s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8363.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8365.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is something I may have asked in the past, so forgive me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8370.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that we're not Cambridge, for instance, but there seems to be in some districts that each building has a really a data person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8381.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I, I know we don't have that, but when I think about, and this is nothing to do with the caliber of teachers or anything like that, but a lot of teachers, my guess, unless they're the math teachers, statistics may not have been their strong suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8397.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8400.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: In the absence of having a literally a warm body always there to help them understand the statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8408.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: How are we supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8411.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, are we able to support them is really the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8420.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there going to be an ask in some way maybe in the budget to figure out how to support that because when I'm listening to this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8425.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like I was, I was a math guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8428.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, I have to admit I haven't done statistics for, I don't know, 20 something years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8437.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: If I got all these reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8442.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: It would not fit into my day and would not fit into my planning period to figure it all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8449.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how are we supporting the teachers that are not the math, I'm sure the math teachers are just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8455.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: maybe some of the science teachers, but what about everybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8537.66s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've heard from a parent about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8779.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: in math, and I realize Faiz is not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8782.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8783.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just, you know, math, I will say, more than many other subjects, you know, requires that you did the last thing before you can do the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8793.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I think about learning loss or gaps, you know, if you're, let's, I'm just picking this randomly, because I cannot honestly remember the details, but if you're in Algebra II, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8810.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: the map that this test is given and a concept that is a definite Algebra 1 concept is a student doesn't know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8821.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're still sitting there in Algebra 2, and that is not on the syllabus, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8829.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not going to be taught this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8834.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Will NWEA map highlight the fact that there's a gap, and then how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8840.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is our expectation of teachers who like they have framework for algebra two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8846.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's not an extra month somewhere they can carve out to teach something that the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8852.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of the kids didn't learn in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8858.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure this is a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8860.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's always been a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8862.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that because of the pandemic, this may not be just like occasionally you'll have a student in Algebra 2 who somehow managed to not know a concept of Algebra 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8872.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in fact, you may have a third of your students who don't know a concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8876.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do teachers manage that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8878.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: And does this testing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8880.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: help them figure it out real fast so that the teacher can sideline what they were planning to do and get back and teach that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8956.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's really helpful to hear that because, you know, there are plenty of parents who think more testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8962.823s">[Ruseau]</a>: And sometimes I'm that parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8966.504s">[Ruseau]</a>: But at the same time, we're not in a regular school year, we probably won't be for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8972.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: 10 years, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8974.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's, you know, knowing that there, this can help us find these gaps with precision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8981.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, nobody wants to just teach the whole school year over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8984.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: The students don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8986.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: We probably can't legally even do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8988.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, but figuring out what, you know, little Johnny was on Zoom and for that month, there was something else going on in the house and little Johnny wasn't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9002.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, there's no way for the teacher of the next year to have any clue that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9008.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9709.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9835.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9838.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: feel like I'm going to just ask a couple questions for which you probably don't have the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9841.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, we talked about MCAS scores, which for the thousandth time, I'm not a fan of, we do know that we were referring to the students of Massachusetts, and we mean virtually all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9856.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: What I don't know is the NWEA database for which they decide to decide that those are the nationals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9864.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are they using, I'm assuming we're not getting some of like, they're not getting, showing us a like district numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9872.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I realized like district at Bessie changes it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9876.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I doubt very much the communities that are in the like districts for us truly changed every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9884.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what I have no idea is, you know, does, who's buying NWEA and feeding their database, is it historically low performing urban schools or is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9897.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know the wealthy Western Winchester's that are buying it, who's buying it, who's this data source because I think that sort of was maybe what member Graham was trying to get at was the national norm mean RIT in kindergarten for ELA is 136.65.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9915.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we were all to just get together for a year and sit in a room and do some research projects, would we all think that it should be 230?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9924.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand the need to like understand how we compare to the state or to national averages and all that stuff and it's it's not that it's not meaningful, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9940.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike with the MCAS, where we know when we see the score that we're referring to an individual student or a district against a known cohort comparison, I'm really unsure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9954.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is NWEA in 80% of the schools or 2% of the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9958.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those kinds of things would matter dramatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9961.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you told me they were in 80% of the schools in the country, all my questions that I'm asking would just vanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9966.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: If they're in 2%, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9970.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: would make me think that the national norm means nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9976.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I'm asking this question realizing you might have to perhaps come back and get an answer later, but it seems really, really important to me to understand whether I can trust that these nationally normed things mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9992.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm glad we're above them pretty much everywhere, by the way, that's great news, but who are the them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9999.734s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10058.203s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10060.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: The appendix is not everything you had, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10063.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you made that very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10067.039s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also understand, based on some of the slides, that you had to do work to make them to hide student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10075.725s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't have the right to see individual student anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10082.99s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I look at, for instance, I'm just the one on my screen, grade level district mean score in ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10089.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I would, if it's not a week of work, I don't know how good the software is at spitting out endless reports, but, you know, I'd like to see that by a few different things, like by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10105.787s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10109.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10115.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10117.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like it when the answer's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10119.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=139.758s">[Ruseau]</a>: No second or a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=142.24s">[Ruseau]</a>: Also motion to sever the capital purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=224.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: Capital Purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=229.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=340.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=347.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to table, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1940.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask, that we get the field trip form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1946.556s">[Ruseau]</a>: and all that Corey details at a subsequent meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1949.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is happening before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1960.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just I'm not suggesting we don't let them go, but we do a policy requiring that form to be approved before the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1968.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll pretend that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1971.169s">[Ruseau]</a>: about the policy for a minute, I guess, but just, you know, let's not put these forward without including all the proper paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1979.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we don't have that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1988.766s">[Ruseau]</a>: we haven't had time to approve it because this is our first meeting and the field trip is next week how does that work policy-wise just curious i just honestly don't know remember um so i mean if the field trip was planned before the end of the school year for the beginning of the school year then it could be submitted then i would say that we should have a special meeting with a one-item agenda we can be in and out in 10 minutes but we we do have that policy because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2014.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I don't want to rehash history, but that's why we do require that we approve the form with, you know, the nursing looked at it and the nursing has signed off on it and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2025.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure that will all happen, but we are also supposed to give the sign off on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2031.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's how I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2033.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, of course, you know, this could have come up literally a week ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2039.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: so i think you know we don't exercise special meetings that often we just save them for like emergencies but i think we should use them more often um for things such as this so we can comply with our own policies there's a motion for approval by member reinfeld seconded by member brandley all those in favor all right all those opposed motion passes enjoy um the field trip to our 23 students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2556.624s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2557.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Were you fully staffed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2565.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a problem not many people probably have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2567.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2569.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we survey whether people are going to participate, do we ask them why if they say no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2586.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just sounds like something that might be interesting just to make sure there's not something that you could do differently that would increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2916.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: The number's growing so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2918.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you talk about why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Title III pays for all of this, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2955.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2956.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3683.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3684.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: I noticed the comment in the teacher feedback that four days was fun, but the two weeks we did before was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3692.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is this two weeks we did before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3754.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3755.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so Desi's paying for the meals and the time in the school and all that stuff, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3763.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they're not covering transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3767.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that, you know...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3770.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: that doesn't mean that we couldn't, I mean, you know, we don't have lots of money laying around, but that doesn't mean we couldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3777.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when the invitations go out, I'm assuming there's lots of people who do not accept the invitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3786.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we asking them why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3787.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is that useful information for planning in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3850.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you're saying Gessie didn't even come out with the grant early enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3857.86s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3871.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4669.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to thank all of the staff and teachers that have spent their whole summer doing all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4676.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of this stuff happened in places that weren't the coolest facilities either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4679.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's one thing to spend your summer working with kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4686.007s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's another to do it when it's too damn hot in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4689.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you to all of the, too many people to list, but thank you to all of this wonderful staff and the administration for making it happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4899.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could you just send line CC to the school committee when the October 1 report goes to DESE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4907.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's not gonna look terribly different, but it's good to have, you know, I keep these reports, but I also know that there are so many of these reports that they're not the important reports, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5141.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm putting it on my list for the budget season because options are the ever nightmarish redistricting, which is not a permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5153.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's sort of like in my mind, it's like a 10 year solution because people who think that they need to go to a specific school will simply buy a house in that district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5162.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: It will be a painful experience for people who bought a house near a specific school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5169.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: knowing that that's where their kid was gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5171.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then they go to register and they find out that's not where their kid's gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5175.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, every district that has ever redistricted, it's not a good experience for the process, but it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5188.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: In my time on the school committee, we have moved programs all over the city because for one reason only,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5196.001s">[Ruseau]</a>: the Roberts was too full or the Brooks was too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5199.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were never doing it because it was right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5202.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was always, we were just too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5205.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, some kids ended up on buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5209.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: The newcomers program has been all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5214.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: making decisions that are right for the kids should be how we're approaching these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5218.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that does also mean we're going to have to all experience some pain in redistricting if that's what we decide to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5226.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm adding it to my list, my short list of things for us to consider budgeting for in the upcoming year, because it isn't like we just get a map out and just start drawing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5237.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: You hire a company, a consultant who is specialized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5241.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are consultants that specialize in exactly this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5244.591s">[Ruseau]</a>: and they figure out things like what happens to busing and like you draw the line here and all there's these three new babies that were born this week on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5252.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like they do all that hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5256.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think we're long past the need to do that because we have to do what's right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5264.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the Roberts is literally, I mean, the scenario of like a bunch of new people just move in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5274.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: to that district that we're in bad, bad situation in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5281.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because if we decide those new kids have to go to another school, well, they might live right beside the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5289.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: And meanwhile, people who are really far from the Roberts, right at the edge, they're getting bused to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5297.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not tenable to just avoid this very challenging and politically very unfun experience, because as you said, we're maxed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5308.205s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5309.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, not that I don't think the principals all do great jobs, but we have principals making about the same amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5316.93s">[Ruseau]</a>: One has 177 more students to manage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5321.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: and I don't think they should get paid differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5323.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we should resolve that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5325.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, well, I guess we'll be talking about that more soon because we can't keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5332.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5463.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5465.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe that there's some members of the public who want to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6267.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6270.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6271.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate that you tried to get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6272.992s">[Ruseau]</a>: It doesn't sound like B2Q actually wants to give an answer to the question I asked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6278.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: After 15 years, my question was pretty straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6282.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any reason to believe that when this equipment must be replaced, that the electric replacement equipment in 10 to 15 years will be any cheaper than it is today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6292.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's going to be a day when we're not going to be able to replace this stuff with...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6298.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: with fossil fuel based equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6302.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I look at expenses like the electrical upgrade, the infrastructure upgrade that's gonna be required if we chose the electrical option, well, that number will get bigger and bigger every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6312.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, that's a lot of labor and big equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6317.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: So every year that number will continue to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6319.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in 15 years, I don't know, double, triple, whatever it will be today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6324.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: um on top of inflation so um i mean my estimate you know is that we are looking at just being fine with an additional 185 000 pounds of carbon emissions by choosing the gas option over the electric option<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6346.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really wanted them to do an analysis, like just pretend electric rates don't change between now and 15 years from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6353.188s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pretend the gas rates don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6355.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we can't know those two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6358.571s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what would it cost to operate these two pieces of equipment over 15 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6363.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that was too hard for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6365.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: Based on the response, it sounds like they didn't want to be bothered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6368.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because this sentence here, frankly, is really obnoxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6373.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6376.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: uh sorry where's that sentence essentially they're saying all that we should care about is cost that that's what they're saying they're assuming that the only thing this committee this community and humanity should care about is how much it costs and if that's the case we should all get some coal going because coal is probably cheaper than everything else um so i i don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6400.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: find their answer particularly satisfying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6403.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that in the future we can decide that we're not going to accept their answer until they actually give us an answer that answers our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6413.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not inappropriate for this committee to want to know this information as we are about to take a vote to pollute an additional 185,000 pounds of carbon into this atmosphere for one boiler at one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6428.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6431.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's absurd that they don't see this as anything other than a cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6440.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how else to be more ticked off about it than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6445.044s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll let my colleagues ask their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6538.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6574.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6577.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: This just dawned on me when somebody mentioned, I think you mentioned kitchen and electrification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6583.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6584.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6585.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we did buy stuff that we have to send back because our electrical infrastructure can't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6592.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you know, we when we decide we want to replace the Brooks's kitchen equipment with induction everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6602.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: we will be paying this expense then because we won't be able to do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6607.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's kind of like every project that is around electrification, we will either decide that we're just gonna, well, I guess we can't do it, it's too expensive, but it's like the same big expense in the middle of all of those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6621.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And which year we decide, which budget do we decide, when does the city ever really have enough money to do that stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6629.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6630.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are big questions, but we're never going to get to our goals around carbon emissions if we just, every time we have the decision, we're like, well, we can't afford it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6642.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're never going to afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6784.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, we do need to approve the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6788.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: capital planning, that the capital purchase, I'll make the motion to approve it because they need a boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7889.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: know i'm just reading an article um from this last year about worcester and their um they they got no bids so they decided to purchase at least 13 buses and that's sort of the trial of bringing busing inside i think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7910.233s">[Ruseau]</a>: The elephant in the room here is that we want workers to work for $20 or $25 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7915.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for every parent that has ridden on a school bus for a field trip, you know that is utterly insane because you couldn't pay me enough money to ride on a school bus every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7925.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: No way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7928.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we want to solve the problem, and I don't think solving the problem is expecting Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies to find these magical people to work for, frankly, not very much money for terrible hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7944.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they're not 40 hour a week jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7948.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, a solution that I'm going to ask you, if you know of districts that have brought all transportation inside, do they really run into these problems or do they have to pay their workers living wages with a pension and healthcare?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7961.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I don't know whether the bus companies do all that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7965.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I do know that they don't pay them enough, but do districts that have brought this stuff all in house and have a union and all that other stuff, do they have these problems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7993.442s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7994.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's just, I don't know either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8047.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I certainly don't think we can do that for this upcoming contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8050.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: That would be impossible, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8054.509s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know that it's a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8056.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, the efforts that Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies are going through to find people to work in these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8064.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I heard, I don't even know who I had the conversation with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8067.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think it was you, but like during the pandemic, all these workers went to work for Uber and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8075.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not interested in coming back to a job paying less that is, you know, I won't say worse because, I mean, obviously lots of people who drive buses probably enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8088.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would not be one of them, but they all went someplace where they got paid even more with a lot more flexibility and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8097.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thinking we're going to get them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8101.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: if we keep paying them the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8103.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the same conversation we have with afterschool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8105.575s">[Ruseau]</a>: We really wanna solve the afterschool, and it's 50, it's 60, it's $70 an hour, and you can raise your eyebrows, but do you wanna solve the problem or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8113.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're not making new people, so we gotta get people to quit existing jobs to take these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8121.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really basic, simple math, it's capitalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8126.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we want to solve these kinds of problems,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8129.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: they can be solved, but they are not gonna be cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8131.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: The taxpayers have to decide, do we wanna solve the problem or we just wanna complain about the problem because the two cannot, or just complain about how much it costs because you can't have both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8145.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, you can, but you don't get a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9293.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to, you know, the bathroom work is great, but we have all been to many bathrooms outside of schools and somehow the uric acid is not what you smell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9304.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would like to hope that there's regular maintenance that can keep it from being where the grout has absorbed all the way to the board, the blue board in the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9316.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: because that's not actually what happens in most bathrooms in most places you go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9322.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've been to bathrooms in other schools like at Shore and they don't have to tap people in to do that kind of work because it's cleaned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9335.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9356.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9487.291s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just, Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9491.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: Apparently, this was news to me because I don't follow this level of detail with food, but the USDA has regulations on the number of calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9501.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have a friend who has a son at the high school who's like, you know, a man, an athlete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9510.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9511.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: the same number of calories have to be given to that person to somebody like me or somebody who doesn't need many calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9519.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really kind of bonkers that like 850 calories, it doesn't matter what on earth you as a human being need is the way it has to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9529.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9530.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: just found this out i found it rather unfortunate but that's those are the usda rules i guess and um i think it's crazy frankly i mean some of these you know i was not an athlete as you probably could have figured out but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9545.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: if I was like 850 calories is a snack for some of these kids and that's supposed to be their lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9553.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just think it's really unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9555.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10067.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10068.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to warn everybody that the rest of the Title IX policies which we'll be receiving in the coming weeks make this look like a paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10077.765s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of them are like dozens of pages long, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10082.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: So maybe we'll want to think about how we get through that in a meeting because we do have to at least read it once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10087.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, for this one, this is one of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10091.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: many policies that we have to, this is when we're updating for Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10097.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: All of our other Title IX policies don't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10100.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's put the past in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10103.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: They should have existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10104.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so I don't, I think the policy speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10108.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there is a number of cross-references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10112.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Almost all of those don't exist in our policy manual right now, but those are the ones that are coming before you in the coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10119.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10180.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10185.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you ask if it was at all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10188.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10191.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10194.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10195.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10196.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10216.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: yes um we this is a relatively new thing for this committee the consent agenda i believe we just created that last year and i believe these are additional two types of approvals or things that we just approve so um i think it was the last meeting our meetings in june where we're like oh shouldn't this just be in consent agenda and i think everybody sort of thought it should so that's why i'm suggesting we amend this is there a motion on the floor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10270.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of the amendment to BEDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8056.596s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to thank you for bringing forward budget transfers to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8060.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8061.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I wish we could figure out where the extra echo is coming from, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8067.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8078.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8080.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8305.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we already motion to approve the Cummings grant or did we already approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8441.797s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Soyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8442.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9382.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dr. Cushing, before you step away, though, are there schools where there's no charge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9745.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I would recommend that whatever community standards are developed that first of all, they're written down and then they're passed by our attorney because, um, students do have a first amendment rights, although it's slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9758.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, and it can't just be a matter of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9761.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: You don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9762.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: The principal doesn't like it because that does a pass muster with we are the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9768.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: the teachers of the government, we are all the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9771.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that is, most people are confused on what the first amendment means, but the government interfering with what can and can't be said well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9782.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: having varied rules about what can be said based on what the content is is not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9789.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, somebody wants to do a rainbow flag here, that's probably fine, but then you go to certain places in this country and the same rainbow flag might get you, you know, expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9802.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's an example of the need to be very careful here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9810.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: some things are offensive to some people and they're not to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9813.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it is not going to be up to the school to decide what's offensive and what's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9818.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a danger here I think that is deeply concerning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9826.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: and uh i don't know that we have thought that part out it can't just be that the principal doesn't like it or you take a vote of administrators that those those are not options so having clear explicit guidelines ahead of time not afterwards ahead of time where you can say here are the guidelines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9850.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: And from the guidelines, any rational person could say that's in or out of bounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9856.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's how you avoid a First Amendment case here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9859.568s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm going to guess that other schools that have the painting thing have already been through this, probably didn't get it done beforehand and then had to deal with the consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9871.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we really should find out what other districts are using for guidelines, the exact language and see if...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9878.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: we like any of that, because that does worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9882.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'll just eat up huge amounts of resources and time and lawsuits, God forbid, but lawsuits cost a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9891.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm very worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9893.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm also...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9897.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about, I'm not concerned about the $75 to paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9900.995s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9904.637s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that it was mentioned that we would set some money aside to help kids that couldn't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9911.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: But as some of you have heard many times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9915.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, not all, there's a lot of new members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9917.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So most of you haven't heard a lot of the things I've had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9920.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: But by the time you're in high school, if you don't have the resources, you're not asking for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9927.259s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9929.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: When you spent your childhood being aware that you don't have the resources, you've learned to just stop asking because that's not for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9937.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's for the kids with the resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9939.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm opposed to charging $75 to park, $75 to paint,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9948.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm still open to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9950.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10432.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10435.361s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's another relevant to the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10441.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: But having funds available for student activities is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10448.524s">[Ruseau]</a>: is a budgetary issue that, you know, right now it's everybody just raise all the money you can, any which way you can, rather than just providing you a reasonable amount of student activity money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10459.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that that's an issue we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10464.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully, if the overrides pass, we can put a small amount of money, small budget-wise, not necessarily small if you're a student and you want to use student activity money, but money directly into that rather than just relying exclusively on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10481.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: using all your free time to raise money, which I mean, all of us were teenagers once, some of us very recently, and you probably could do something else with your time other than raising money for your favorite clubs, like doing the activities in the clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10497.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I hope we can get to that point where we're not expecting that of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10503.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10526.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10527.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to waive the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10550.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10551.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this, as I mentioned in our last meeting, is one of many policies I'll be putting forward to deal with the Title IX changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10560.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10561.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10562.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX changes that came from the Department of Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10565.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: recently and our professional association provided templates well they provided the language um and so this is one of many they they come together and sort of as a set but rather than making us have to pass um 45 pages of policy in one night um they're broken up so i assume everybody can read but it's on harassment and retaliation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11023.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also, you know, I was talking to a friend who lives in Cambridge about this question, and it was interesting because she's a highly engaged voter, an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11035.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: She had read the actual state packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11038.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a little booklet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11041.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: The booklet that comes out and explains it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11044.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: And she had read it, and her impression was that it removed the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11049.298s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11050.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't received mine yet, so I haven't read it yet, so I don't know what the language is exactly, but I think it's such an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11056.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: We, first of all, in Massachusetts, cannot end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11060.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: If it's not MCAS, it has to be something else, because the federal government requires that we do this testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11066.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: The federal government does not require that it be a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11072.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: we could not, the state could not end MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11076.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if they did, they just have to institute something new and give it a new name that would be MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11083.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think anybody who's afraid that we're going to stop being able to compare Medford to other districts, if that's something you want to do and you want this one test, you'll still be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11095.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it does mean, and you know, it's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11099.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's talked about as it's not a common thing but it does happen where students are excellent students they are engaged they get great grades but they are for whatever reason just incapable of passing this test they cannot get a diploma in this state which is insanity teachers assess their students all the time and if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11125.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: professionals with masters and PhDs think that this student is, is competent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11130.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that isn't good enough, rather than a test that was written by, frankly, not educators in, you know, some offices somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11141.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: And why did Desi move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11144.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know where, I don't know where they moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11147.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: that they're the wrong people to determine that this person is ready for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11152.185s">[Ruseau]</a>: And before that, before we had the MCAS requirements for graduation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11156.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: we were still at the top, Massachusetts as a whole, was still at the top for education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11161.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not like the MCAS made us number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11164.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were number one before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11166.294s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think the harm that the stress, the pressure, the teach to the test, all that other stuff, it's just negatively impacting education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11178.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not exactly news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11180.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm very supportive of getting rid of the MCAS requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11184.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11346.03s">[Ruseau]</a>: I need a giant screen, but then nobody will be able to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11352.655s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11353.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11354.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11411.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Orso, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11412.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Mayor Longo-Kern has abstained due to conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11498.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11503.051s">[Ruseau]</a>: I actually submitted two policies and the other one got dropped by accident because somebody thought it was the same policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11511.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the next agenda, there will be a different one, which is around use by students and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11543.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the amendment is to add to the listing of the products<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11551.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: to include, what is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11592.936s">[Ruseau]</a>: They wouldn't be prescribed a pouch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/f4DKETRRFaY&t=11764.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think I know the answer, but I just want you to confirm the English learners are not the letter name, letter sound inventories is they're not there because of they have a very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=390.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll put it in the chat for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=765.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, Member Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=768.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: The FY25 for the Brooks water heater, didn't that come in at $267,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1250.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1254.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1256.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Peter, do we know if that included handling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1260.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, these would be networked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1262.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: So do we know if that included figuring out how we're going to network at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1309.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly like to be involved in any conversation on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1313.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep, happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2538.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I just don't want to disagree with Peter, but we are definitely, you sort of almost got there where I was going, but we're just cutting future kids, not the kids in front of us now, is what we're doing, as if they don't matter anywhere near as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2557.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's really, I do think that treating it as, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2568.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a, what's the word I'm looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2570.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a values proposition here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2574.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: By not cutting from any of the kids now, everybody, the kids, the community can think everything is dandy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2581.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we end up in full-on crisis when there's nothing left that can be done, which is where we are in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2588.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think, by the way, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2594.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, it's been a couple of years it's been a couple of decades at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2597.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yeah, I'm sort of beating that horse but it is, these are these are decisions that I think very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2607.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need to make and understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2611.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: do things do cost more over time, even if they don't get more expensive, you know, exponentially, at a minimum, they're gonna get more expensive from inflation and all the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2623.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, we've got to stop saying no, and we've got to, if we need a million dollars in maintenance costs a year, and we have to choose between maintaining our facilities or taking services away from kids, we need to take services away from kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2965.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only other thing I see in the bottom list that I think it would behoove us to have as soon as possible is the electrification assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2977.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, I have no clue how expensive that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2981.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like the kind of thing you do at one elementary school and you can copy and paste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2988.691s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the middle schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2991.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I don't actually think it makes any sense to consider electrification at the high school at this moment in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3002.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for the other schools, I think knowing what it would cost so we're not dealing with a break fix scenario and don't have a real understanding of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3015.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: the gulf between what an electrification option would be and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3022.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: going with gas or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.247s">[Ruseau]</a>: So not $800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3442.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's like project management as well or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3618.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3621.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3622.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm looking at the policy, and you may be going right next to this, but we are supposed to create four lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3630.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, we have one list all done, which is the all projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3633.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3636.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, when we pass this, you know, one of the lists is projects that are eligible for Community Preservation Act funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3646.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: net school spending, and then things that are not eligible for either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3651.898s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just wondering, who has the expertise to decide whether something is eligible for CPC funding or CPA funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3757.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I don't even think, that's not really an opinion, that's fact kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4212.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I think we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4219.519s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to continue the meeting to a date yet to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4233.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4234.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: To November 19th then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4235.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: At what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4239.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Five o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2503.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2507.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of these fixtures, I mean, we were talking about one part per billion, 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2514.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we have a sink at Medford High with 967 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2524.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: The thing is, is that all of the really bad stuff isn't at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2529.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the worst two are at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2534.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: 235 parts per billion at the Andrews, 180 at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2541.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there are 176 fixtures over 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2549.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm obviously very interested in mitigation, but I really hope that how we are here and why we are here doesn't get any kind of sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2563.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: No sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2564.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2566.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2570.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, 967 parts per billion, I bet DCF would take a kid out of a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2577.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2578.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like that's like, well, I can't do that kind of math at this hour that quickly, but hundreds of times over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2587.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: the maximum amount before you have to shut down equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2592.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to the results of the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2596.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: I look forward to all the very graphic detailed reports explaining what was snaked and looked at and where every fixture that does get replaced, I want those fixtures saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2607.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: need to know where they came from, how they were purchased, how did we end up with them, if it was a fixture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2613.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously if it's not a fixture then we got to find the root cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2616.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't want it to just be we replace the 376 fixtures, it costs a million dollars or whatever it costs, and we throw them all in the dump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2627.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: There needs to be answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2628.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, for the Medford High stuff, the answer is that's what it was when we built it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2633.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for everything else, I want to know who received funding to sell us a piece of equipment that was not necessarily allowed at that point in time, because I just can't believe that these levels are a result of purchasing the appropriate stuff and putting it in front of children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2656.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do have a question about whether or not it makes sense for the school committee to draft a policy on required testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2663.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: One of the things that's very unclear right now is like, what does it cost to test every fixture in our whole school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2670.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, is it $50,000 a year or is it a vastly bigger number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2676.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And without that number, it feels like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2679.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, my gut test everything every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2682.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if you tell me it's going to cost a million dollars a year, then my gut starts to feel a little less comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2689.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I understand that this testing we weren't paying for, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2696.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2697.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, if we can get an estimate for what it would actually cost for us to do this on the regular, I would like to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2706.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of how much on the regular would depend very much on the investigation as to how we are here and why we are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2714.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we find out that this certain fixtures were purchased and they had lead in them and we replaced them, then it makes sense that we don't have to test those fixtures regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2726.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: But those schools are 24 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2730.015s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm looking back at the data on the state's website there are a few from 2016 or 2018 but pretty much nothing ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2738.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I want to make sure we're never, we don't leave a future school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2742.387s">[Ruseau]</a>: and certainly kids and staff to discover that they've been consuming this stuff for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2751.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's, I don't know if I have a question, but those are my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2755.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5002.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Make a motion to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5033.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5035.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of policy GBEB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3645.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: to go up on that point of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3647.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at the last budget we just passed for the schools, you'll see that there appears to be a $3.5 million increase in transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3656.565s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at our transportation contract, it's actually, we pay them more per year than our last budget's total transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3666.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: because it shouldn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3668.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, in the past, because our budget wasn't big enough, we would not be school committee, but, you know, the finance people and the superintendent would get together and they would just like start erasing numbers and making them smaller to get down to a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3682.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because by law, every penny we spend in our budget has to be tied directly to where that penny's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3688.973s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no wishful thinking in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3691.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it looks like our budget for transportation went up $3.5 million this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3696.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: It didn't go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3697.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: It went up a little bit, like 80,000, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3700.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3701.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: The rest of that money, previous years, was just not on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3705.016s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then you would not hire some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3708.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: They take some money from these accounts that aren't really for transportation and pay the bills that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3713.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you have no idea how much it costs to run this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3718.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the first budget in the time that I've been on the school committee where the transportation line item says what we have to spend for transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3726.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a very simple example because it's such a stark jump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3729.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there were budgets since I've been on the school committee where we have full-time special education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3736.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: permanent teachers, and if you looked in the budget, their salary on the budget says zero dollars, because it wasn't enough money, but we weren't gonna fire them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3744.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we just kept them in the budget with a zero, and then on July 1st, we started paying them, and we didn't pay for other things that we needed to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3753.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the budget has always, in my time, in seven years, this is the first budget that actually makes any sense to anybody reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3761.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a level of transparency that I'm just thrilled by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3766.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really hard because it does mean that if you decide you're gonna be transparent, next year if transportation is 4.1 million, you can't just suddenly decide it's gonna, well, we'll put three there so we can keep these teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4755.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our next question, we discussed this a little bit in the beginning of the panel through the remarks offered by our three panelists.<br><br>
