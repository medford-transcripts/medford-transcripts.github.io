    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9531.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9541.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=9547.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is it actually kept cold while it's sitting in the class for an hour or two?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1940.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just had a question about, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1946.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a question about whether the in-class breakfast, how is the milk transported to the classes and how long does it sit in the classes and come back and over and over multiple times a day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1956.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do you track that the milk isn't the same milk going to the class for four or five days in a row?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6.577s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mrs. Metz, here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1575.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1576.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1577.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: Michael stole my first question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1579.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1580.17s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was bound to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1581.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: I knew it was bound to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1583.551s">[Ruseau]</a>: So what is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3113.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm struggling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3118.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could you all stop taking my questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3123.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3124.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3126.038s">[Ruseau]</a>: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3187.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just to follow up on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3188.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3188.724s">[Ruseau]</a>: So do you think that recess has any place in the discipline system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=3195.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: Should recess ever be taken away for disciplinary reasons?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4542.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: Teaching colleges, you did mention your work with Desi around, you know, what teaching colleges are really, how they're preparing teachers or often how they're not preparing teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4553.865s">[Ruseau]</a>: How would you systematize supports for new teachers in particular?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4557.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because, you know, of all the teachers I've spoken to, their first year is sort of like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4564.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: a very bad memory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4565.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, they don't sleep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4566.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4567.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4567.737s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it just seems to me like a lot of that is just a lack of supports for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4573.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how would you systematize some supports for them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4733.203s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=5618.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6399.377s">[Ruseau]</a>: I get to go first so that nobody steals my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6406.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was my number four question, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6407.581s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wasn't prepared for you to point to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6414.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll just go with the question, my number two question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=6417.925s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7757.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7758.449s">[Ruseau]</a>: Teaching colleges often don't prepare teachers for the challenges of a classroom right out of the gate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7765.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: What would you do to systematize supports for new teachers to ensure their success?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10365.117s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10367.018s">[Ruseau]</a>: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=640.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=643.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, with all these schools, I'm sure, I'm hoping you can have an answer to this question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=647.767s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=681.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, actually, one that's popular, but for which that doesn't make it necessarily a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=687.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure that answering this is uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2733.89s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2744.292s">[Ruseau]</a>: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2808.531s">[Ruseau]</a>: And do you think that recess should ever be used, should ever be removed as part of disciplinary action?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2819.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Should you ever take away recess?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3389.432s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, but when you get a chance, I have a question from Sebastian and from Justin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3393.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3408.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3410.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: That sounds pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3413.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's see here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3415.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you believe that civic engagement should be a part of the education process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3420.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if so, what programs or policies would you continue or begin to foster civic engagement?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3427.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if not, why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3433.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is a lot better, I know, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=3435.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't write the question, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4805.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9096.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9096.902s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hi.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9099.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a short question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9100.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9101.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not necessarily a short answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=9103.424s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you are skeptical and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11589.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sometimes I feel like the more I learn, the less happy I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11597.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11898.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=60.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=126.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: Your mic may be on, it may not be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1696.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I didn't go and add a lot more data because I felt given the task it was very difficult to try to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=3034.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's coming through okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4350.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you explain how geozones are different than just drawing lines now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4453.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's really fancy gerrymandering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4459.217s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sorry?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4459.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's sort of like gerrymandering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=4461.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not trying to be like, this neighborhood goes here, it could be like... No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5253.405s">[Ruseau]</a>: improving community engagement and buy-in from all sectors of the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5258.847s">[Ruseau]</a>: I feel like parents are sort of a de facto, I think those are our constituents, but they just paid our taxes and the rest of the community didn't, we'd all be in trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5269.089s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so finding a way for the rest of the community to, not that nobody else in the community cares about our schools, but we're making sure that the rest of the community that doesn't have kids right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5279.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: is as close to as interested in the students as parents are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5284.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe not as interested, that would be a lot of work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5289.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: So for me that, and that's not a short term thing to fix, but it seems to me that it should be a very high priority, always, forever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=5303.041s">[Ruseau]</a>: Getting us on that road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=12.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: is to review the resolution on the disciplinary practices of suspension pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020, excuse me, order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law and the Governor's March 15, 2020, order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=181.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: The agenda for tonight is the purpose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=184.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's only one thing on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=185.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: The purpose of the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee is to review the resolution on the disciplinary practice of suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=193.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will read the resolution, which is going to be the shortest thing I've read so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=199.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: The resolution was sent to the subcommittee by the full committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=203.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: last Thursday, I believe, or I don't remember when our meeting was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=209.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Resolution on the Disciplinary Practice of Suspension, whereas Mayor Lungo Kern and the Medford City Council have declared racism a public health emergency, whereas Black, Latinx, and disabled students are disproportionately suspended, whereas suspensions harm students that are not suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=226.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: Whereas dropout rates are higher among students that are suspended, whereas out-of-school suspensions increase the likelihood of juvenile arrest, whereas suspended students are more likely to repeat a grade level, whereas students that are suspended are not being educated, whereas school attendance is a critical requirement to receive an education, whereas receiving an education is a requirement of academic achievement,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=254.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: And whereas student achievement is the highest goal of all school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=258.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, therefore be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools, one, ends the use of out-of-school suspensions effective the first day of the school year 2021, two, provides for the continuation of a learning environment for every in-school suspension, ensures that two, three, ensures that in-school suspensions will not occur in isolation without instruction or rehabilitative counseling,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=281.069s">[Ruseau]</a>: Four, select alternative tools for use in disciplines such as restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=286.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: And five, incorporates any funding requirements to ensure the implementation of the selected alternatives with fidelity in the next budget cycle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=295.34s">[Ruseau]</a>: At this time, I will open the floor to anybody who has questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=299.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: Any members want to speak?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=323.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you all could raise your hands, just so I can figure out who to call on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=337.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: Either one is fine because there's not 450 people in this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=343.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. DeLava.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=492.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=493.98s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody else must want to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=495.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: They all came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=500.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=500.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=502.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=506.523s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=507.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: I guess it's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=820.0s">[Ruseau]</a>: Apparently, okay, can I share just one thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=826.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a lot of things open on my screen, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=836.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: There it is, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=839.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=840.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=844.07s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody see that okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=850.898s">[Ruseau]</a>: So one of the questions I had after listening to Mr. DeLeva was,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=857.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: actually, it might have been Mr. Downs that mentioned that suspensions are, you know, in-school suspensions are treated the same because there's not an education being provided.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=868.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the state is still definitely reporting them separately as distinct things, Mr. Downs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=924.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: So are you saying nobody is tracking the difference between taking them out of the classroom and sending them to guidance and sending them home for a week?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=941.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul, Mr. Delato.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=951.662s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=956.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Zoom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=957.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: One second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=959.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: Stop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=960.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: Share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=960.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: There we go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=961.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=962.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=965.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, my understanding is they're really, I mean, I understand that the law might say that they're the same thing, but unless somebody is telling me we never send a kid home and that they're always still on the premises, then there is a difference regardless of what the law says.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1061.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to share their screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1063.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have it right here in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1064.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is definitely not zeros across the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1067.705s">[Ruseau]</a>: For in-school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1069.586s">[Ruseau]</a>: They have student discipline days missed reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1076.19s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's no, I can't know whether or not discipline days missed means, if you're saying we don't have an in-school suspension program, then these are all days that kids were not in the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1090.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we're not reported at all when we take them out of class for two periods.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1097.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because that's not accurate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1112.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm looking at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1295.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: In favor of in-school suspension or better yet, getting to the root of the cause because, my apologies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1304.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1324.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you know where my phone is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1330.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1410.969s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1411.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1563.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1564.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would, if I may, if we were equitably providing suspensions, I would be more than willing to have a conversation around how we can solve the problems that cause suspensions, but we are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1583.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: 62% of suspensions adjusted for race were not white people, and 38% were white people, white students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1593.439s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that tells me, unless we are comfortable having a conversation around the suggestion that the black kids are worse than the white kids, which I am not comfortable with, and I don't think there's any evidence to suggest that's an accurate view, that we have two problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1608.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have the problem of how do we address kids that might actually need a suspension?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1614.434s">[Ruseau]</a>: which is what I hear you talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1616.555s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't hear you talking about the fact that the primarily white staff notices the black kids doing the same things the white kids are doing, and they're the ones that get suspended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1626.521s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's like, it's almost tiring that that needs to be repeated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1632.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that nobody's offended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1634.446s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also hope that if you are offended, you understand that you are not understanding the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1640.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: But,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1642.509s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, this, this problem is not the issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1646.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: First of all, your example of a knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1647.911s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, I grew up in rural New Hampshire and I would have been shocked if any of the kids didn't in high school didn't have a knife in their pocket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1655.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: That would be weird.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1656.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there wasn't a time, you know, long ago, perhaps even in my lifetime, when in some parts of this country, people brought guns to school and that wasn't actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1666.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: call the police scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1668.032s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, what I think of as like suspendable behavior and what you think of and what everybody thinks of isn't the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1678.395s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it isn't the same for every child either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1681.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: Which child is considered performing a suspendable behavior isn't the same child to child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1688.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1690.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: My biggest concern right now is not whether or not a kid comes to school with a pocket knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1694.802s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I'm not talking about a big Bowie knife that is intended to behead a deer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1698.743s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm talking about a pocket knife.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1701.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: If that kid's getting suspended, I would say that's already a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1704.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I think if there's intent or any reason to believe that that knife is there for a violent purpose,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1713.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a different conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1714.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: But just the presence of a pocket knife, I mean, I think would be a pretty shocking reason to suspend, in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1724.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: And again, everybody has an opinion, and everybody's opinion is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1728.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's another problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1731.707s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, this resolution was intended to solve the problem that has not been solved with all of the good work of all of the good people in the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1740.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do believe it's good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1742.63s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not an attack on anybody, but it is still not getting better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1748.852s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I think that a new, looking at this in a different light of, okay, we aren't gonna solve the racial disparities in how kids are seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1761.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: simply by wishing it away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1763.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we can all take anti-bias training till we're blue in the face, but unless you grew up under a rock, you're still going to see the black kids as the kids that are threatening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1775.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so it's, I feel like it's my job on the school committee to figure out how to make sure that they're not getting suspended because these out of school suspensions are not just times where they're missing their education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1787.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1788.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: dramatically increased rates of dropping out, which we need to rephrase that all together, but also the opportunities to be involved with the police are dramatically increased when kids are not in school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1805.31s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll let other people talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1807.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=1808.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2050.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, do I have to unmute you, Stacey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2433.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's my understanding, my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2462.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just a quick point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2465.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Department of Ed data that we reported to them indicated that 81% of our out-of-school suspensions, students disciplined with out-of-school suspensions, 81% of those were non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2483.365s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would suggest if the feeling is that there's a threat involved, we need to take a hard look at how we're coding this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2491.797s">[Ruseau]</a>: because the story I'm hearing is that we're really concerned about the safety.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2496.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the safety of what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2498.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody vandalizes the wall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2500.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: That doesn't seem like a safety offense to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2503.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would just ask that we, you know, as a note, realize we need to be really caring about how we report all of this data, because this is why we're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2515.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the data reported<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2516.914s">[Ruseau]</a>: said that, you know, we were doing all these suspensions because people were trying to kill other kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2522.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wouldn't we wouldn't have this resolution and we wouldn't be having this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2525.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: But instead, it says 81 percent of the suspensions at the high school, at least, were for non-drug, non-violent, non-criminal related behaviors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2534.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: That to me is chewing gum, swearing at a teacher, writing on a wall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2540.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I don't know what other other things fall in that category, but the vast majority are for things that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2546.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: don't sound like what you're all concerned about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2548.951s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that concerns me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2551.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: The other one thing I did want to quickly mention, and now I forgot it, but I'll come back to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2557.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I do want to let Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2558.817s">[Ruseau]</a>: Moretti, who's been waiting a long time with her hand up, I apologize, speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2562.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you unmute yourself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2563.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2777.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=2990.009s">[Ruseau]</a>: Superintendent, you would like to speak, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3122.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3122.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I'll have, um, may go next then, uh, member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3129.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where did they go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3130.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did she, he or she lower their hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3144.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: Uh, never Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3352.608s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to say one quick thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3358.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: When I was writing the resolution, I didn't just sit down and pop it out in a half an hour and call it a day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3363.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I did, I would say, many hours of research and read plenty of articles about how just banning it and calling it a day<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3373.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: creates full-blown chaos and it's a nightmare for districts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3376.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are plenty of districts that have done that in California, for instance, where no resources and no planning and no alternatives were even considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3385.495s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was just the school boards over there, just like it might've been in the legislature, just said no out-of-school suspensions and chaos ensued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3395.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: And often that stuff was even reversed so bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3400.532s">[Ruseau]</a>: want to be clear that this resolution was not an attempt to just, you know, stick it to you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3406.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: That wasn't the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3407.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: The goal was to, as Member Graham pointed out, you know, if we pass this, it is inclusive of the requirement that we provide the resources, which I heard earlier from Mr. Peleba and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3421.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: Schulman that, you know, there was a program, it wasn't necessarily the best one, but then the resources just went away.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3427.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3430.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: The committee has to be as committed to making this happen long after, if we pass this, long after this passes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3440.217s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we can't just forget at budget time that the restorative justice or whatever other program, that it's not free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3449.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aside from the staff, literally there's a lot of costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3452.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I went to every single session on restorative justice at school committee conferences,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3458.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: on how to do it right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3460.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: And most importantly, I was looking at what not to do, because every district seemed to have a story about how they screwed that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3468.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the theme among all of those districts that the biggest takeaways for how to not do it right was to not put any resources into it, to just think your staff is going to wake up in the morning and know what restorative justice is, or do it in one grade level and just hope it kind of just flows up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3488.843s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is not an attempt to just flip a switch, call it a day, and put a check mark next to our names that we cared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3497.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think Mr. Assistant Superintendent Murphy would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3795.634s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Dave, Mr. Barker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3798.295s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just would use the words implied disproportionality, I believe you said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3803.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's be crystal clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3804.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is no implication here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3806.336s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is absolutely no question that it is disproportionate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3811.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: And any argument against that, I would just love to hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3833.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3834.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3835.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: Looking at the amendments on the screen, and then I will call on Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3838.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rodriguez.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3840.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, across the nation, I don't really mind that part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3844.736s">[Ruseau]</a>: It does sound a bit defensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3846.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like, let's be clear, it's not just a Medford problem, but I think what just happened to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3853.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: I lost that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3859.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3860.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maryse, was that yours?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3864.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3866.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why don't we let Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3867.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rodriguez speak now, since she<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3992.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=3993.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there another, Mr. Downs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4081.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4082.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think this is a really, really important point that Mr. Downs just brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4087.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, and I could never for a second defend, you know, suggest that we not defend victims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4096.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I also want to remind everybody that I don't believe there's any spot in the law that says we can just permanently take a student and never educate them because they have become a perpetrator against the victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4106.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: They still have to get an education too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4109.613s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not talking about adults who can be just sent off to the prison and never seen again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4115.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're talking about a kid who did something wrong to another kid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4118.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: And looking at the data, there's been no sexual assaults reported.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4122.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: I find that hard to imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4124.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm guessing it's, again, more of we're not reporting it the way it really happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4129.028s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I find that really problematic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4133.17s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when a kid does something to another kid, no matter how egregious, that other kid is coming back to school, whether it's tomorrow, a week from now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4144.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: the victim doesn't suddenly become whole and happy and like it never happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4149.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the approach is to use punitive measures against the perpetrator, and that's the end of the story, we're not helping the victims at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4160.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because first of all, the perpetrators are likely to be doing it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4165.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, the short term problem of dealing with an incident can't be the whole plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4174.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do we make it so that these two kids who are in the same AP bio class are going to be able to be in the same AP bio class for the rest of the semester?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4186.21s">[Ruseau]</a>: Suspending one of them isn't going to make it easy on the other person, the other student, at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4194.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they might feel better for a minute, like, yay, Johnny got suspended for doing what he did to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4201.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: that doesn't make it any more comfortable for the victims.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4204.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I just think that focusing on, and that's the whole point of restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4209.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that is just in the resolution, it is such as restorative justice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4215.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not prescriptive as to what the school system will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4218.22s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would leave it to the professionals to figure out what the right choice is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4222.963s">[Ruseau]</a>: Restorative justice is one of several programs that are available and I have not evaluated them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4227.987s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's why it's not prescriptive as to what one gets to use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4232.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just the only, it's the one I've heard of the most.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4235.716s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, but, you know, the whole scenario that we have to be able to take the kid out that did something terrible, we're not talking about murder here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4245.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, and we're not, according to the statistics that we keep reporting, we're not talking about sexual assaults and rapes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4254.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're talking about, according to this, the vast majority of these are non-violent, non-drug,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4262.071s">[Ruseau]</a>: criminal offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4264.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's not Johnny punched somebody in the face.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4267.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not a rape.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4272.498s">[Ruseau]</a>: The vast majority of these kids who are losing their education and are having increased probability of ending up in prison are kids that are doing things that I'm betting everybody on this call has done all of those things, many of those things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4288.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4289.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need to be careful with false equivalencies and drawing generalities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4293.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also think that even for those severe things, unless there's some kind of loophole I know of where we can just say, Johnny, you don't ever come back to Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4304.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good luck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4306.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: That kid's coming back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4307.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that kid's going to make the victim uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4310.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's worry about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4312.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4315.64s">[Ruseau]</a>: My son's a ninth grader.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4317.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is he going to do anything wrong in his whole four years in high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4320.191s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4320.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that we have a plan more than just punishing him.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4325.034s">[Ruseau]</a>: What about the person that got hurt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4327.696s">[Ruseau]</a>: So who else wants to talk?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4332.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=4534.605s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5050.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. Murphy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5139.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5141.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I guess my question, and I apologize for not knowing this, but if we pass this, and of course you are suspending as required or allowed under statutory<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5154.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: authority, and looking at the current Department of Ed dashboard, which is terrible, if anybody's not looked at it, you're lucky, is it a breach of any privacy rules for you to tell us explicitly what those suspensions were as related to how they were covered by the law?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5220.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5221.02s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think if I'm not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5224.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: speaking for Michael that just spoke, you know, I mean, having this opening, which is there whether we put that in there or not, is fine as long as we can have a, you know, trust but verify that the stuff you put into that category is in fact, we can verify that you truly put the right things in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5250.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I don't believe that the reporting on the Department of Ed's website is actually, unfortunately, and I don't, I mean, it's such a terrible website that I'm not surprised, but they really should just have a, you know, a section for required by that statute 222 or whatever it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5268.523s">[Ruseau]</a>: a whole dropdown that just simply lists that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5270.564s">[Ruseau]</a>: So those would be the ones that you have to report that way and that you don't have a choice on suspension or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5277.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unfortunately, they don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5278.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I, you know, I just, you know, it can't be that today the report shows that 81% of the suspensions are for non-violence, non-drug and non-criminal related offenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5291.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we do this and two years from now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5294.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: It turns out that we're at 80% of our suspensions are for violence, as if suddenly the whole population became violent overnight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5303.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think we're all on the same page there, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5363.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we can agree on the last part of that, not on the first part.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5367.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if the student has not been imprisoned, they still have a right to an education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5373.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: I agree with that part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5380.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I don't know whose hand was up next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5381.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it was miss member grams.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5724.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to let everybody know we are a little over time, so I will let a couple of, if you could be brief, Member McLaughlin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5752.179s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will bring that up right at the end, because it's not that it's not relevant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5757.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's, I believe, an entire meeting unto itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5761.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. DeLava?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5841.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5841.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. Murphy, did you want to speak real quick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5844.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5845.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5846.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in the chat early on, there was a comment from Lisa and Michael about the issue of removing from the academic setting, which is sort of at the root of suspension from the academic, providing an education perspective, in that during our pandemic,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5874.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: What does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5876.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if somebody is excluded from a class, my son, he had changed his name briefly in the Google Meet or Zoom session in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5888.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as a result, the teacher kicked him out, which was fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5892.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the teacher at the moment didn't know that, in fact, there was no way to add him back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5897.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so he was without that class for a while until we noticed that he wasn't actually participating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5903.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was not an intentional type of situation that happened there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5907.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the issue of excluding from the academic setting while we're in a remote educational situation, really, I mean, we would need several more hours tonight to go over that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5922.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: That is an important topic, I think, that hopefully the administration and principals are talking to their staff about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5928.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: What does that mean to mute students, to remove them from classrooms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5934.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are issues that, from a purely academic perspective, they're the same as suspension.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5942.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we probably would, nobody would ever call it that, but that's probably a fairly accurate analogy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5949.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm going to bet we won't ever report that kind of stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5952.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: How on earth could we?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5954.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just think it's an important thing to make sure that is being talked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5963.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's, it's, it's, we're way over time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5965.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't know that I can really, Superintendent have, have you all had conversations about this particular topic yet?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=5977.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry to put you on the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6042.0s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I think about this particular scenario, it reminds me of the impact over intent is an important consideration here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6053.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I've been muted on a meeting and I didn't take it personally, but that doesn't mean somebody else being muted didn't take it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6060.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we're talking about young children,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6063.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: they don't necessarily just take it personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6066.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: It might really be a severe impact to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6069.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: And certainly, obviously, would impact their ability to participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6072.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I appreciate that you'll bring that up with your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6077.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there anybody who wants to say anything finally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6079.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, we have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6081.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't have really a copy of the amended version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6087.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if the members are comfortable with the amendments we've discussed, we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6094.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: we can cobble those together in a document, send it in the packet, and then if we get it wrong, we simply can amend it during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6103.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there a motion to approve this as amended with the superintendent's changes and the reporting changes that member Gramp offered?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6114.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: And forgive me if there are other amendments that I'm not thinking of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6154.574s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a second?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6158.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6158.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: And member McLaughlin, I believe you have to do a roll call because.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6174.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6174.589s">[Ruseau]</a>: Three in the affirmative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6176.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the resolution as amended will be sent to the school committee for our meeting following the next, I believe is the 28th of September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6186.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6189.382s">[Ruseau]</a>: as with anything that we send up, the school committee is more than welcome to amend it at that time as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6195.384s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this does not necessarily make it set in stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6199.865s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any other comments?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6202.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6203.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6203.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6223.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6224.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Member McLaughlin, if you could take a roll call for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6228.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6231.703s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6236.104s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6236.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much, everybody, and have a nice evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6238.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: And good luck tomorrow.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqhmAQnFD74&t=6239.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: My kids are very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2526.247s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a mask mandate in city hall?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2543.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can we have everybody use a mask as required?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2547.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: The mandate wasn't a request, it was a mandate, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2572.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll motion to adjourn this meeting if I do not have masks on everybody in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2578.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not sure what the point of a mandate is, if it is not actually gonna be followed in the very chamber where we're actually governing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2610.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2835.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2844.382s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2846.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't see on the agenda the Boy Scout part of the... I know there's some Boy Scout thing going on tonight, and I would like to not have them wait until hours from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2857.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any way we can... I don't know where it is on the agenda, so it's hard to take it out of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2868.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=2871.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3684.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3685.334s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3686.395s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just had a quick question about our dashboard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3688.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: Does the dashboard include Kids' Corner staff and children that are in the Kids' Corner for positive cases?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3699.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=3700.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't, if you don't know, I mean, we can just, I'm not sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5391.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5392.498s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've just got a question about the format here, because I'm assuming a bunch of us have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5399.262s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is the format going to be that we will, sometimes we do the public first, sometimes we do us first, or us at the beginning and the end, and I don't really have a preference, but I just want to know what it is so that we don't just move on and none of us have asked our question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5662.315s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have lots of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5665.016s">[Ruseau]</a>: First, I'd like to thank Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5666.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: Puccio and Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5667.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: Retromel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5670.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know speaking at the podium isn't really, well, always easy, and I appreciate the details, and I also greatly appreciate getting a copy of one of the statements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5682.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: I look forward to the other one, because a second time through is always helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5687.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do have a couple of sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5689.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: technical questions, and I don't know the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5691.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not asking them to be facetious, but I'm hoping Dr. Cushing can answer them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5696.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because there's certainly questions that I've seen asked on social media, they have been asked tonight, and I'm asking them because I wanted somebody with a definitive answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5708.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: So one of the questions that I have is, privacy laws and all that other stuff, I think there's a lot of misunderstanding,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5720.837s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe there isn't, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5723.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: But my question is really simple.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5725.579s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can a victim be told what the punishment was that was given to somebody who harmed them if we assume that there was a perpetrator, if you will?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5734.503s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can they be told what the punishment was?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5772.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you and I asked the question, I wasn't really quite sure, because, you know, if anybody's been victimized, knowing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5784.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: that there was an appropriate response is really important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5788.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for adults, when that happens, there's the news, there's the court filings, there's all that other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5797.141s">[Ruseau]</a>: And FERPA obviously has nothing to do with anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5800.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we are accustomed to being able to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5804.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: And actually I think victims of crimes like are given this information purposefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5811.408s">[Ruseau]</a>: because they kind of deserve it, but in the under 18 crowd, whether they deserve it or not isn't really relevant because they can't have it, and I just think that's an awful place for us to be, but it is what it is and I just want everybody to understand that because I've just.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5830.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: know, it's just been a lot of online commentary about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5835.669s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, this, I've noticed that none of the school committee members have had a statement on what's been going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5842.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, and somebody asked me why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5844.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I said, because we don't know what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5847.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't have the rights as a school committee to know anything about this case at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5852.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: No more rights than anybody else living in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5856.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5858.661s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, that makes it uncomfortable because people would assume we know lots of things that we do not know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5864.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think it's important for the community to know that we don't know all this stuff and we're keeping it to ourselves or we're, you know, being coy or anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5874.966s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't know, we should not be asking, and certainly we should not be told if we were to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5882.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, I just think that's really important to be clear<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5890.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a lot of other stuff that was from the presentation, actually, not so much there, but I don't know if we wanna do the questions on the presentation now, because mine are really just a small set of those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5906.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll ask one question then, one more question and we'll move on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5909.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also wanna thank the community members that have stepped up to be substitute teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5915.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know a couple of them and I know that it was a huge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5922.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a lot of conversations with one person who decided to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5926.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a hard thing to, you know, you've not been teaching or you're not in the workforce right now and to volunteer to be a substitute when then the news makes it sounds like being a teacher is going into a war zone every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5938.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a huge thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5939.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I would just encourage anybody else who might be thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5944.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: Look, if you try it and you don't like it nobody's gonna be angry, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5949.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: You might like it and we really, really, really need you to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5954.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also wanna thank our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5958.285s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we talk about the lack of mental health services in the community, our staff are doing these evaluations, determining kids need services and then sending them back to class because guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5970.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no services.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5971.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that means that the teachers are dealing with kids that are having unmet needs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5979.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's just the way it's gonna be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5982.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no magical group of counselors for us to hire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5986.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's horrible and it's ugly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=5991.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just really wanna thank the staff that deal with this every day that are trying to help the students to the best of, but I mean, most of these referrals out of the school system are for things that our staff are not trained to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6006.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, but they still have the students and they're doing their best and I just think it's really important to thank them for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6012.22s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll stop because I have lots of other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6974.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6975.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6978.609s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Member Graham, for asking those questions about the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6980.951s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we have any social workers in the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6984.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: School adjustment counselors are social workers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6985.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6986.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6987.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: That answers that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6989.315s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then all my other questions are really about the presentation and the exclusion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=6994.798s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm gonna save those for subcommittee, I think, because there's a lot in here I just don't think really<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7006.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: matched up with our conversation over a year ago, but this is probably not the right meeting for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7012.755s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do just want to point out around exclusion, you know, and data, because I mean, it matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7020.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: I went and looked at the Department of Ed's data just before our meeting tonight, and it says that since 2013, we've actually had zero expulsions in our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7033.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like to believe that's true,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7036.17s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think more likely what's happening is our reporting is abysmal, and I don't put that on any individuals particularly, but I know of specific suspensions that occurred in the elementary level that do not show up in that reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7050.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think it's really important for people to understand that when we talk about exclusion and suspension, we're talking about the stuff that's actually happening, not what's on the website for the Department of Ed, and the differences are shocking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7064.11s">[Ruseau]</a>: the differences and what's really happening versus what's showing up on that website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7068.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think some of it's related to the data systems that we have and how they're all connected and how things get coded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7075.96s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I just, this issue of suspensions is much bigger than if you just go look at our website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=7083.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll save the rest of my questions for subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10151.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: Before I offer, before I motion to table this, I just want to, I've received a couple of communications about concerns about my items on the agenda in context to what's happened in the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10164.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just think it's, and I'm going to actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10167.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: at a subsequent meeting make a suggestion change to our rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10170.588s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I wanted to make it clear to the community that this item number two was actually emailed to the superintendent's office on November 10th for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10180.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was not in relation to what has gone on in the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10184.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: I try to plan my motions out far in advance and apparently I did not hit the jackpot with the timing on this particular one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10193.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: So for number two, I would like to make a motion to table this to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10203.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Number two, I would just like to send to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10234.973s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, the 20th is quite a rather interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10238.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's do the first meeting in January.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10240.939s">[Ruseau]</a>: January 3rd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10266.135s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10267.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: This also was submitted on November 16th, not related to the last week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10273.501s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, two strikes and I'm out, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10276.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I would like to just motion to send this to subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10762.179s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau, I think wants to answer that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10764.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10764.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I have the actual report in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10767.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was only for the McGlynn Middle, although there was a little bit of the McGlynn Elementary included because of the fact that it's one building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10774.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, the report was done by the Center for Trauma Care and School Alliance of Inclusion and Prevention Incorporated, possibly the longest name for a company I think existing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10787.285s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's one long name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10789.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I remember when we got the report, and I,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10797.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: The biggest takeaway was that things were dandy, which was surprising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10803.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: And maybe it was just that things were pretty good, considering what everybody thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10809.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that might have been really what was happening is that everybody thought the McGlynn medal was, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10816.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, culturally a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10818.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: They came in and they they surveyed students, the Yale population, I don't have the full list in front of me, and the staff MTA, and things were much better than I think people had imagined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10831.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: the gun clip incident was months before when they finally were in doing their work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10839.588s">[Ruseau]</a>: So of course, things can improve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10842.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we did have one, but it was not for the high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10845.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can't remember, was it last year or the year before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10852.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was one of my budget priorities that I have is that we would be doing these on a rolling basis through all of the school communities, you know, like one every other year, but because I think it is hard to keep the pulse as staff and students and families and principals and everybody's changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10871.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the state and the federal government is telling us to change all these things all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10875.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's school committee members, certainly we can't keep a pulse on this ourselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10883.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think in the short term, the focus for me and why I'm also a co-signer on this is that it seems that the high school is definitely where it needs to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10891.746s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just wanna also comment on the amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10902.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the amount is completely a mystery because it was paid for by the mayor at the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10907.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we were not even consulted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10909.877s">[Ruseau]</a>: The mayor just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10911.522s">[Ruseau]</a>: I presume picked up the phone or the superintendent picked up the phone and made the call so we'd I have no idea what it costs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10919.832s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, therefore, there was no basis for the number in here, but we had to put something in here, so this number may well be wildly more than is needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10931.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: I emailed the company that did the last one, and they really could not give me a number without consultation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10937.613s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I said, well, it's not me they should be consulting, it's the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=10942.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we just picked the number that hopefully will be the right number or big enough, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11240.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11241.327s">[Ruseau]</a>: And to kind of build off of that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11244.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, when I remember Graham and I were talking about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11248.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I think everybody in this room can probably come up with some examples of things we think should get done that would have effects on the culture and the climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11258.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what seems most important is that somebody who will create this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11266.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: will tell us the order to do them, because we can't do them all at once, even in the best of cases and best of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11272.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't want us doing feel-good projects around climate and culture that have no real effect, because we've missed the elephants in the room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11281.915s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I expect some of those elephants in the room to be uncomfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11288.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: If they're not uncomfortable, then just send out a Google<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11291.727s">[Ruseau]</a>: survey and call it a day because that's a waste of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11294.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: This, this should be telling us things like is our health curriculum, missing the mark on relationships and you know like there should be some pretty big things that are identified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11311.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what they would be actually, but so it's really important that not just that it's a big list, maybe it isn't a huge list, but it's the order that it needs to happen is really important, I think, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11353.306s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11361.187s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/znVC7Rz2lFI&t=11362.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2826.661s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2829.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just not for this particular one, but I do believe we'll have to take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2832.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: roll calls for everything with a member online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2841.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2842.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2843.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2844.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Kretz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2858.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2859.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=2860.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Stone, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3758.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: No questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3761.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Roussell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3762.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would just like to thank you for the effort to find all this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3767.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Free money, from our perspective, is the best kind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3770.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3771.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: And do you have any sense yet on how many teachers will be interested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3775.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you think that you will have to deal with too many people applying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3980.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the result.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3981.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was just looking at last year's numbers, at least according to the DESE report, and we had 39, 37.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3988.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's a good increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3991.856s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that we had a drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3993.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't gone back and looked further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=3995.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there, I mean, I haven't looked through this report since it's just right here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4002.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there a particular area where we're seeing a lot of, I mean, that's what, nearly 200 students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4104.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4107.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just on that point, I believe we were at our charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4109.979s">[Ruseau]</a>: So being steady makes sense because we can't exceed the charter cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4115.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: although I thought the charter cap might be a few students over 395 actually, so that would be surprising and lovely if we were under the cap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4126.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, the smaller the number, the better for us, but that would explain why we have been steady.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4133.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't quickly find the charter numbers, because it's the DESE website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4138.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: Enough said on that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4304.964s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4307.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4308.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is a new format of this report and I just want to say bravo because it's very nicely done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4314.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4318.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: Please make sure she receives our thank you, because this is excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=4321.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5138.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5140.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since you're bringing up the reading, you know, and in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5144.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: The samples that we have here, I'm looking at them and I'm wondering, considering the state of reading in the United States, it doesn't surprise me that a student took two hours or more to do this if they are frankly a typical second grade reader or third grade reader, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5169.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: So does this test understand that a vast number of students aren't able to really read at grade level?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5175.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is there an expectation that the students can?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5180.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just really confused by scoring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5183.707s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5184.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a reading test.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5186.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's about what they know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5187.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, how do you answer what you know if the student has to read something for which they're not capable of reading?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5193.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're gonna get the answer wrong if they ever get through the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5199.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just confused how this can understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5325.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just one, forgive me if I've already said this, but the reports that the teachers have are student specific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=5334.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6318.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6319.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6321.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6322.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6324.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6326.184s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McStone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6327.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=6328.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo, current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7985.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the motion as amended to include disability in the sentence that includes race, gender, or bullying, it will now say race, gender, disability, or bullying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7996.022s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=7998.524s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Hayes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8000.266s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Kretz?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8002.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member McLaughlin?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8003.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8005.234s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Musko.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8006.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8007.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, Mayor Longo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8040.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8083.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: We already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8086.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: I already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8185.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just realized that in the announcements, the rules and policy subcommittee meeting is this Wednesday at 4pm.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8192.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll be picking up the wellness policy related to recess, often called the recess policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8199.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to include that for anybody watching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8202.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the notice was posted today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8205.292s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8363.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8365.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is something I may have asked in the past, so forgive me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8370.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that we're not Cambridge, for instance, but there seems to be in some districts that each building has a really a data person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8381.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I, I know we don't have that, but when I think about, and this is nothing to do with the caliber of teachers or anything like that, but a lot of teachers, my guess, unless they're the math teachers, statistics may not have been their strong suit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8397.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8400.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: In the absence of having a literally a warm body always there to help them understand the statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8408.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: How are we supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8411.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, are we able to support them is really the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8420.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there going to be an ask in some way maybe in the budget to figure out how to support that because when I'm listening to this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8425.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like I was, I was a math guy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8428.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, I have to admit I haven't done statistics for, I don't know, 20 something years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8437.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: If I got all these reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8442.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: It would not fit into my day and would not fit into my planning period to figure it all out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8449.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how are we supporting the teachers that are not the math, I'm sure the math teachers are just fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8455.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: maybe some of the science teachers, but what about everybody else?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8537.66s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8773.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've heard from a parent about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8779.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: in math, and I realize Faiz is not here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8782.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8783.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just, you know, math, I will say, more than many other subjects, you know, requires that you did the last thing before you can do the next thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8793.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I think about learning loss or gaps, you know, if you're, let's, I'm just picking this randomly, because I cannot honestly remember the details, but if you're in Algebra II, and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8810.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: the map that this test is given and a concept that is a definite Algebra 1 concept is a student doesn't know it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8821.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're still sitting there in Algebra 2, and that is not on the syllabus, if you will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8829.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not going to be taught this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8834.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Will NWEA map highlight the fact that there's a gap, and then how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8840.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is our expectation of teachers who like they have framework for algebra two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8846.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's not an extra month somewhere they can carve out to teach something that the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8852.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of the kids didn't learn in the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8858.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure this is a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8860.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's always been a normal thing for teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8862.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that because of the pandemic, this may not be just like occasionally you'll have a student in Algebra 2 who somehow managed to not know a concept of Algebra 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8872.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in fact, you may have a third of your students who don't know a concept.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8876.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do teachers manage that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8878.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: And does this testing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8880.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: help them figure it out real fast so that the teacher can sideline what they were planning to do and get back and teach that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8956.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's really helpful to hear that because, you know, there are plenty of parents who think more testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8962.823s">[Ruseau]</a>: And sometimes I'm that parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8966.504s">[Ruseau]</a>: But at the same time, we're not in a regular school year, we probably won't be for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8972.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: 10 years, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8974.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's, you know, knowing that there, this can help us find these gaps with precision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8981.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, nobody wants to just teach the whole school year over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8984.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: The students don't want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8986.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: We probably can't legally even do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=8988.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, but figuring out what, you know, little Johnny was on Zoom and for that month, there was something else going on in the house and little Johnny wasn't paying attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9002.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, there's no way for the teacher of the next year to have any clue that that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9008.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9709.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9835.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9838.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: feel like I'm going to just ask a couple questions for which you probably don't have the answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9841.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, we talked about MCAS scores, which for the thousandth time, I'm not a fan of, we do know that we were referring to the students of Massachusetts, and we mean virtually all of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9856.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: What I don't know is the NWEA database for which they decide to decide that those are the nationals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9864.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are they using, I'm assuming we're not getting some of like, they're not getting, showing us a like district numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9872.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I realized like district at Bessie changes it every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9876.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I doubt very much the communities that are in the like districts for us truly changed every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9884.221s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what I have no idea is, you know, does, who's buying NWEA and feeding their database, is it historically low performing urban schools or is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9897.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know the wealthy Western Winchester's that are buying it, who's buying it, who's this data source because I think that sort of was maybe what member Graham was trying to get at was the national norm mean RIT in kindergarten for ELA is 136.65.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9915.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we were all to just get together for a year and sit in a room and do some research projects, would we all think that it should be 230?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9924.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I certainly understand the need to like understand how we compare to the state or to national averages and all that stuff and it's it's not that it's not meaningful, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9940.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike with the MCAS, where we know when we see the score that we're referring to an individual student or a district against a known cohort comparison, I'm really unsure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9954.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is NWEA in 80% of the schools or 2% of the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9958.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those kinds of things would matter dramatically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9961.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you told me they were in 80% of the schools in the country, all my questions that I'm asking would just vanish.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9966.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: If they're in 2%, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9970.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: would make me think that the national norm means nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9976.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I'm asking this question realizing you might have to perhaps come back and get an answer later, but it seems really, really important to me to understand whether I can trust that these nationally normed things mean anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9992.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm glad we're above them pretty much everywhere, by the way, that's great news, but who are the them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=9999.734s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10058.203s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10060.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: The appendix is not everything you had, obviously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10063.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you made that very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10067.039s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also understand, based on some of the slides, that you had to do work to make them to hide student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10075.725s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't have the right to see individual student anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10082.99s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I look at, for instance, I'm just the one on my screen, grade level district mean score in ELA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10089.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I would, if it's not a week of work, I don't know how good the software is at spitting out endless reports, but, you know, I'd like to see that by a few different things, like by school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10105.787s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like to see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10109.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10115.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, look at that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10117.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like it when the answer's right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi5mNKAxLlE&t=10119.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=49.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to table to the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=56.076s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3150.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3152.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: I, this is a question I don't know if our attorney can answer the question or the superintendent knows the answer but I do not believe we can legally tell anybody what the consequences of a disciplinary action were, even if we are not talking about a student by name.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3166.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: Nobody in Medford knows who the student is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3168.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm assuming somebody knows who the student is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3170.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also assume somebody knows who the victim was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3173.089s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, it'd be like talking about, well, the president, we won't mention his name, is in trouble and this is the consequence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3180.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the school committee also does not receive any notification and cannot have access to information about the consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3188.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3190.345s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's just a fact, whether or not the superintendent can tell the community that expulsion will happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3195.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know the answer to that question but I do know that we cannot receive notification that a student will be expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3203.352s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can read the law as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3204.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: If there was a murder, I think it's fairly safe to say that most of us would conclude an expulsion was on its way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3214.015s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, but, but we will not receive that notification, ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3219.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I just think it's important when asking these questions to, to be clear who you're asking, because you won't get the answer from the seven school committee members, what the answer is, ever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3234.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: We do not write the law, you all get to change the law by going to your state reps, we write resolutions all the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3241.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are always calling our state reps and state senators and saying, we don't like this law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3246.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want this law change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3247.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one on the thing tonight, exactly that I have the floor, so you can wait Mr beacon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3253.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3256.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3258.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've heard people say they want to change the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3260.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are so many laws I want to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3262.593s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think many of us have very specific laws in common with all of you that we want to change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3268.676s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we don't write those laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3270.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: We call our state reps most many of us know our state reps and state senators, and we give them our opinion very often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3278.775s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, but we don't like the laws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3281.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you have a choice, we can break the laws, which I know that some people are quite comfortable with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3288.408s">[Ruseau]</a>: And therefore, if we break the laws, if we break the laws, then the people that we broke the laws, you know if we just sit up here and we somehow know the information about somebody who's accused of something, and we disclose it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3301.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, that make make us all feel good until we have to write the check as a city for violating the law, so we are not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3310.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: None of us are afraid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3311.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are also not going to get that information to share it with you because we're not going to get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3315.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3315.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mr. Beacon is going to tell me how I'm wrong now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3317.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3432.349s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate that an attorney, I'm assuming who is a member of the bar doesn't think that the law matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3442.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: The law actually, if I could speak, the law does not actually include the school committee and discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3448.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: The principals have all authority on suspensions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3451.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: In fact, students can't even appeal it to the superintendent unless it's more than 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3458.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if you wanna come and ask us to do stuff we can't do, and that makes you feel good, then you should do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3464.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if you want something to happen, then we do have to pay attention to the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3472.432s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, my daughter was also in that school texting me and I was very upset too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3477.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not just like some rando.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3480.734s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I know how you felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3483.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know how you felt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3484.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: My daughter was texting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=3486.556s">[Ruseau]</a>: Point of order.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=7443.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8196.894s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8197.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was very happy with the answers as my confidence in you is boundless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8203.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I wasn't surprised by many of these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8206.877s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's one word that I'm sure you know what word it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8210.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm going to talk about opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8214.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our contract and the amount of professional development time this district has,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8219.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: is essentially the legal minimum in my understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8222.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: Other districts, they have 189 days that they pay their staff and we do 183 or 184, 183, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8231.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if you think about six days of professional development for your staff year after year after year, it is unreasonable to conclude that those six days of professional development do not make a dramatic difference in your staff's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8248.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8250.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I'm not asking you how to solve that because that's a financial problem and something we'll have to discuss perhaps the next contract to try and get maybe one more day of professional development, which would be a 25% increase, which would is a real substantial change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8266.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: When I see the word opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8269.32s">[Ruseau]</a>: I read that to mean the staff may decide to participate in the professional development or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8274.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that is correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8276.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8333.833s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8334.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8336.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: I feel like this is really a question for next year, which is I believe when we start the next contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8342.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Actually, no, we got a plus one so we have a little bit more time but I do think as a district and as a city we need to talk about funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8350.481s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, we always have to talk about funding but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8353.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know if we can get one more professional development day which is, I believe, around $100,000 if I remember some big number to pay the staff for one more day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8362.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: I may be misremembering that but it's it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8366.248s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not $10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8366.928s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, we.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8374.272s">[Ruseau]</a>: in five minutes flat and certainly you and your role as a leader could come up with a year of professional development if the staff did nothing but do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8384.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I think we should have a real hard conversation about how to expand that available time because when I look at other districts that are doing 189 days, I mean, I'm assuming they're doing something interesting with their professional development and it just feels like we are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8403.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: missing a lot of opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8406.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, there's opportunity to really move our staff forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8412.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not expecting staff to do this on their own free time in the summer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8415.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is part of their job that they should be paid for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8418.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we're not gonna pay them, we certainly can't demand them to sit on professional development.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8424.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I hope when we get, it's probably 2024 when we should really be talking about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8432.245s">[Ruseau]</a>: a good sense of like, do we want to go for one more day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8435.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we want to go for two or three?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8437.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I'm assuming you would agree that we could fill up two or three more days of professional development a year in a heartbeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8444.736s">[Ruseau]</a>: We always could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8445.276s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8445.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=8446.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9420.829s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9422.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was contacted by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9425.481s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm slightly embarrassed, I can't remember who contacted me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9429.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody I didn't know yet on Facebook about the coalition, the Feed Kids Coalition, which is working to press on the state legislature to make free school meals permanent as Maine just did a few weeks ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9443.352s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the importance of it is not just really about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9449.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: free school meals which is sort of the obvious part, the, the challenges we face as a district, when we do our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9457.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: Prior to the state doing their budget means we have a choice to include the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9464.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then perhaps that money turns out to have not been needed, because the state decides in the last minute to include in their budget, or we don't include it, and then the state doesn't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9475.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: decide to make it free and then we're stuck where we are not providing free meals to our kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9481.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just an awful position for all school committees to be in because I don't think any school committee's budget is done at the right time to deal with the uncertainty that the state budget has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9492.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: Last year, the state did extend the free school meal in the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9500.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, they did it, I think their budget wasn't even done before June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9504.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: 30th I think it was actually after that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9506.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we had already as a body decided that we all we have a policy that we will provide free school meals but then we did not include it in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9515.743s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we got, frankly, very lucky that we have a policy that we were not going to fund, and then the state came through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9524.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this coalition is just trying to press on our state legislators to make it permanent, take this uncertainty out of the entire process for school committees and for students and families, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/KbmDLbbGzYg&t=9538.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I wanna thank everybody for hopefully supporting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=7134.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9654.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, are we talking about people who have actually applied, or we're just gonna randomly pick people that you want, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9675.486s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I just wanna clarify, you keep using the word alternate, though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9677.927s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are not alternates, so I don't know what you think the non-voting members are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9682.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: They must come to every meeting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9685.336s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are required for a quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9687.297s">[Ruseau]</a>: Actually, I'm not sure about that, but they must come to every meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9690.658s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9691.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: But they are not alternates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9697.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: They don't get to vote if voting members stop showing up or if we have to find a new voting member, they don't get the seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9831.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, I find it offensive that as a politician, you're using the politician in the four-letter word, sensitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9836.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really obnoxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9838.188s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanna be very open with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9840.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're a politician there, you're talking about politicians in the negative sense that the public frequently does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9846.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not helpful when politicians ourselves talk about each other in that sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9850.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, you're not concerned about the number of politicians, you're concerned about politicians in the negative sense of the word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=9857.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just need to get that out there, because your tone is extremely offensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10268.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are required by law to be approved each year by the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10491.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/XPHQFz6BgV8&t=10494.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for doing this tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5773.745s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to speak on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5777.793s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5780.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: The resolution does speak for itself pretty clearly, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5783.378s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think it's, you know, Medford has done things differently than lots of other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5791.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: In fact, doing things that are, oh, that sun is right in my eyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5796.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: And done a lot of things that are frankly not even, that are explicitly laid out in the law, in mass general law, that should be done differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5803.594s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's sort of a mountain of things in that category.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5808.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: The.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5809.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike Somerville, where they have transferred the buildings over to the city, in which case the school committee has no authority over school buildings, also doesn't have to pay for any utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5820.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: And during COVID, the school committee could not open their buildings because they had no authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5825.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: The city had all authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5827.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in Medford and the vast majority of communities in Massachusetts, the school committee has explicit and total control over our buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5837.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that that is not then how Medford is operated, but we should be doing no capital improvements to our buildings, we should be doing no emergency repairs to our buildings, unless the school committee has authorized them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5852.971s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that's a part of the resolution that's not actually stated clearly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5857.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I guess it is in the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5859.015s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, and I just want to make it clear that this committee, um, the majority of the folks that ran for office, um, included in their platforms that we would stop, uh, using fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5871.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, um, I just, uh, that's what this resolution is about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=5875.041s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, um, I'd make a motion to approve unless somebody else wants to talk on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6027.032s">[Ruseau]</a>: I certainly am very interested in this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6029.855s">[Ruseau]</a>: I read it, and I have a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6033.758s">[Ruseau]</a>: This resolution provides an out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6035.839s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are going to be situations for which we must continue to use fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6040.843s">[Ruseau]</a>: For instance, I think sometimes when it comes to the backup options,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6045.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: having an electric primary system and a backup system that's fossil fuels right now might be the most<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6051.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: appropriate thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6052.89s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I hear that the city's hiring an OPM to do a project that the school committee has not even authorized, I can't help but feel like there's a big problem here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6061.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm not interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6063.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: If at the end of that presentation, we need to have a meeting to discuss approving that project to use fossil fuels, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6070.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that would become the new policy of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6073.135s">[Ruseau]</a>: Putting it ahead of this, to me, feels a bit like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6076.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: we're gonna go ahead, hire an OPM and start doing some work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6079.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then after the fact, the school committee said, you can't do that going forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6083.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, that's not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6086.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the law is explicit that we have this authority and nobody should be touching our buildings without our approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6093.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm incredibly interested in this presentation and look forward to it and definitely want to know a whole heck of a lot more about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6103.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: the options and the site challenges I understand that we have with geothermal in that area.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6109.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if in 10 years, the federal government says, under no circumstance could public buildings use fossil fuels anymore, did we just blow however many millions of dollars and have to rip it all out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6121.522s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't know what the future holds, other than the fact that from the climate, we sort of have a pretty ugly picture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6127.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we don't know what higher levels of government are going to do<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6131.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: when they finally come to grips and finally start taking very strong action to stop the use of fossil fuels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6139.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: And public buildings are usually the first thing they go for because that's the stuff they have control over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6145.981s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I respect very much director Hunt and her work and especially the work around the library and the police station.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6156.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: I look forward to working with her and lots of other folks on the new high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6162.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think we need to draw a line in the sand someday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6165.191s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know when anybody else would like to draw the line, but I feel like it should have been done 50 years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6173.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: So maybe now's a good time to draw the line in the sand on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6177.139s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, this resolution allows for us to decide, okay, we're gonna stick another fossil fuel thing in our buildings and just pretend that the climate is not completely falling apart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6189.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's an option, but we need to make that vote when we make that decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6194.444s">[Ruseau]</a>: And today, we aren't even being asked about these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6198.125s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6254.237s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everything you said except for one thing I agree with, you do not speak for the committee without us voting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6260.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I really take offense to the idea that the chair who by definition the chair is the servant of the body is not the head of the body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6269.309s">[Ruseau]</a>: That is the definition of a chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6271.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we did not ask you to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6273.712s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I appreciate that as the mayor with the purse strings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6277.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: that there's a lot you can do and there's a lot only you can do, but we didn't ask you to do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6284.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so you didn't, as the school come forward as a representative of the school committee to get this work done, you came forward as a chair, as the mayor, you don't have that authority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6295.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, that's very upsetting to think that you can speak for us if we have not voted, because you cannot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=6426.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember all the potty?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8457.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8458.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like the presentation I especially like the additions to it that were spoken because there was things sort of missing I thought from the presentation that you answered about the backup gas boiler backup is probably the wrong word since it will actually need to be in use anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8478.995s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is my seventh year in school committee so I'm just going to be blunt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8483.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: If a future superintendent doesn't like the electric bill.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8486.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can they turn off that system and just go to the gas system to save some money, because that's, that's an, that's a Medford mo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8493.78s">[Ruseau]</a>: we're gonna cut this budget this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8496.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if we stop using electric at the Andrews and just use the gas backup system and it costs way less money, that is a decision that won't come to the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8504.528s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'll just be somebody in facilities or in the superintendent's office, no offense to the superintendent, but when the pandemic began, or maybe it was just before the pandemic, Director Hunt evaluated the high school about what it would be, how we could save money by installing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8524.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: more efficient equipment to heat or cool the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8527.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: It turns out there's no such thing as more efficient because all of the equipment was turned off or dead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8532.244s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you can't do better than zero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8535.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I'm just deeply concerned as this is a system that could support just in perpetuity if somebody decided the electric bill was too high.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8552.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: I assumed I just, you know, just thinking about like how we're going to figure out how to make sure that that does not happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8557.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not for you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8561.018s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm super excited by the solar on the Andrew stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8563.281s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's very exciting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8566.605s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a question about what is construction manager at risk process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8692.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8693.452s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's nice to hear that it's not the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8698.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: waterfall approach or whatever it was called where you have to just wait and wait and then you get the low bid and it's the lowest bid by a long shot and everybody's like uh-oh like what did we get a bid for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=8709.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not sure my colleagues will have other questions but I'll come back to my question because I gotta find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9759.002s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9759.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think you're answering my question about R22, which was that when we're done with this, there will be no more R22 in use at these two buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9768.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9768.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9769.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: Best thing I've heard all night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9771.725s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9773.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our stuff was good, but there's also more great stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9776.306s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm going to scroll up here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9781.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just renovated my kitchen, and I had to spend a fortune on power upgrade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9787.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: which on scale probably is less than the $350,000 that we were talking about for a whole school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9798.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is obviously a problem in probably every municipal building and school building in the country.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9806.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there anything going on of interest around how this is funded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9811.235s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because to think that every school building in the country will be able to pop<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9816.315s">[Ruseau]</a>: a $350,000, right, a $350,000 check for electrical upgrades, that just doesn't seem like a scalable or, you know, we have Prop 2.5 in this state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9827.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there's no way every school building is ever going to be electric if everyone has to upgrade their, the do national grids bidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9836.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we all look at our bills and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9839.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like we pay this much for electricity and this much for the delivery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9842.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what's included in delivery if it doesn't include actually the infrastructure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9847.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is this just the way it is right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9850.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there anybody looking at how to change that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9855.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is this sort of like when I upgraded my panel at home, like 8,500 bucks just to install my new kitchen stove?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9863.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that what we're talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9901.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: When I did this upgrade at home, which nobody cares about my home projects, but one of the things I'm worried about is, in 20 years, is this going to be enough power in 20 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9914.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when we talk about these buildings and we spend $350,000 to upgrade the power, is that really enough power no matter what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9921.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or are we going to potentially have to do this yet again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9924.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I'm sure that the power that's there now was big and powerful and a lot when the building was built, and far more than a building 50 years older.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9934.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is this just like we're on a treadmill of dumping tons of money to have more power come to buildings?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=9942.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or does this feel like this would be an amount of power that nobody can imagine using at all kind of thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10007.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10052.928s">[Ruseau]</a>: A little flip in your kitchen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10054.409s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=10056.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11667.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11668.057s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11670.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: the rate card format very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11673.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where did the 10% come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11674.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just threw those numbers into a couple of different intra-inflation calculators or compounding at 2.5% like we can do for increases in our property taxes here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11685.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I come up to a number of much bigger than 440.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11689.825s">[Ruseau]</a>: As an example, the elementary school gyms in FY16 for<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11697.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: The four category I actually don't have a category differences, the 400 would actually be $520 and you know we're not swimming in cash so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11710.056s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you just pick the 10%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11795.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was my next question, but you answered it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=11797.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12372.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12374.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do think it's important to figure out how we invite people is is a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12378.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then scheduling becomes a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12379.96s">[Ruseau]</a>: So more people we add to the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12382.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like in the past, we've said we really wanted to hear from principals on something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12386.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: then we needed to make sure principals could be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12389.61s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is open so everybody can come, but I think figuring out how to tailor the people that I'm gonna try to reach out to so that it's not going to be November before we can hold the meeting, it's a battle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12404.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: And some groups of people will be people that I will have, none of us will have any way to actually contact them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12409.702s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm really hopeful somebody will be able to tell us how we can get ahold of former students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12416.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe Joan's shaking her head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12417.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if that means she has some way to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12419.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: She does good, it makes me feel better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12422.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: But yeah, so I hope to hear from lots of different people who have a relationship to the Curtis Tufts past and present, because we do have a very important question to answer here and the timeline is not on our side, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12438.636s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, I'm not a fan of rushing anything, but yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12444.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: would have a choice here, so thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12447.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd make a motion to approve, although I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=12770.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I have motion to approve that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13014.577s">[Ruseau]</a>: And a lot of this HVAC equipment, I mean, we heard, what was that, 32 weeks or something crazy for the lead time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13020.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't envision this as something that is going to actually gum up the works at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13026.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's more of a FYI.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13028.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, it's only FYI if it needs to be a fossil fuel-based equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13032.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: If it's not, then spend all the money,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13037.754s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13067.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, and if I may, I certainly, first of all, I mean, the kind of equipment that we're talking about is not normally purchased stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13076.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we're not, fossil fuel stuff is stuff that has to be installed, and like, it's a big effort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13082.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there was another, earlier in our consent agenda, we had a couple items that actually shouldn't have been in the consent agenda because of the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13090.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I went, for the next meeting, I was gonna actually make a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13093.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: policy change to our consent agenda to include things like field trips and donations so that we can include those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13101.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to include this as well because why not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13105.371s">[Ruseau]</a>: So sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13133.182s">[Ruseau]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13139.66s">[Ruseau]</a>: Roll a potty's excitement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13141.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13141.902s">[Ruseau]</a>: I love it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13142.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's very not everybody on the audience can see it, but it's enjoyable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13147.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anyways, remember, we're hungry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13148.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember Bramley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13149.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm very hungry, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13151.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13152.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13153.229s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13154.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13155.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: Roll a potty?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13156.932s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13157.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13158.773s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rossell?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13159.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/RAMzOXnU5sc&t=13159.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Lungo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=61.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: The gang's all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=62.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think Chad is the only other person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=89.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll be back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6568.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are in fact limited by our city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6572.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/A1IveHErhfY&t=6573.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: If everybody in the room was like, Federal Rec should be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=658.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1100.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to suspend Rule 46 requiring a second reading of 2024-26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1116.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1117.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: That motion to, do we then have to actually motion to approve the policy?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1122.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're not having the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1123.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we have to then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1125.531s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1127.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1161.765s">[Ruseau]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1163.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: You want me to speak on that, Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1166.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1167.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we have our consent agenda and in the policy that explains what's allowed to be in there, it has, well, I don't have the full set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1176.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a list, a laundry list of things we allow to be in a consent agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1180.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as we have discussed, well, I mean, last week, we actually accidentally had them in the consent agenda, but this just simply adds the approvals of capital purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1191.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in our last meeting, we talked about how we wanna be approving them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1195.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then I got a question from an administrator about, so how do you do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1200.01s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we have to come here and do a whole song and dance every time we wanna buy a new skylight to replace something leaking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1208.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't think the intent of this committee is that we have a song and dance every time we have to replace the skylight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1216.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: any of these approvals that are capital purchases, so we're not actually funding them, but the city is, but the assumption is the administration has already talked to the city and the city said, yes, we'll pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1242.932s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we can just sever anything we actually need to discuss for real.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1246.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it just seemed like, you know, we already had one tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1250.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think actually last week after we had talked about this, there was another one as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1254.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's just like, when we don't really think we need to talk about it, a consent agenda sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1259.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1268.327s">[Ruseau]</a>: May I make the song and dance again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1271.21s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to suspend the second reading, rule 49.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1280.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/b7dJktkvvbU&t=1282.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve the updated BEDB policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=112.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Branley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=115.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=119.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=120.679s">[Ruseau]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=121.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=122.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Sohir, Mayor Longo-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=227.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just would like to note that both of the student reps are actually here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6561.141s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6562.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for the best presentation I think I've had in seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6565.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: The worst one at the same time, of course, but I understood it in a way that I feel like I've not understood our finances before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6574.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's just one of my goals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6575.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wish it was a presentation about wonderful things and it was just as clear, but that's not what we got tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6583.86s">[Ruseau]</a>: In last year at this time, I was on a little bit of a rant about how every single year on page eight, you have this correction to all of our fake spending.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6597.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in every budget that I've been through, we would say that homeless transportation was 100,000, even though it was 500, 600,000 the year before, because we had to get to the number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6608.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we would put a number in the budget that was completely a lie and everybody knew it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6613.647s">[Ruseau]</a>: And last year I ranted because we had the, what did we spend in the previous year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6618.431s">[Ruseau]</a>: What were we actually budgeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6619.832s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they were, it was like no other thing I've ever seen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6623.375s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like to see us spending 1.1 million and then budgeting 250,000, it was really kind of like, and I was ranting, I'm like, here we are, next year we're gonna be in the same exact spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6635.804s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you made me a bit of a, I'm glad to be wrong for the first time on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6640.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unfortunately, that does mean that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6643.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: the budget is reflecting actual expenses, which everybody can agree is what we would want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6649.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just, that means that we can't, this budget does not represent a fantasy so that we can get to the number in the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6657.302s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I greatly appreciate that as hard as that has made this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6716.837s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we still have the custodial contract to settle, which would be 2021 through 2024, and additional for the next coming year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6729.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6731.446s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think there's a couple of things I just want to say about budgeting that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6735.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm going to go back to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6743.866s">[Ruseau]</a>: option to have a penny of additional spending outside of an identified revenue source.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6750.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there's this other thing, when we're talking about this undistributed salaries, because we're in the middle of negotiations, if we set aside $600,000 for what may be the cost to settle a contract, and then we don't have it settled before the end of the fiscal year, all that money just flows right back to the city, and then the following year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6774.262s">[Ruseau]</a>: the smart accounting would be whatever you think you need for this year, plus the 600,000, because you're going to still need that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6780.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we've had years where we would have $1.5 million set aside for contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6785.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: We wouldn't finish the contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6787.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: We would send it back to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6789.016s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the following year, we budgeted $250,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6790.478s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no world where that math makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6797.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: That problem, some of that problem can be solved by the school committee getting contracts done on time, which we are working very hard on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6804.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it creates this very lopsided thing when you look at our budgeted allocations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6811.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the budget goes up $1.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6814.702s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't even spend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6815.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: It went back to the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6817.504s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then the next year we got, whatever the increase was, it doesn't tell you the story because that was money for three years ago contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6826.69s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when we look at that graph that shows percentage increases year over year, it is a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6835.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not that it's not important, but it does not mean really what it says it means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6840.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: And even if we were to do one of actual expenses year over year, well, in this year, if we paid three years of contracts, that's this year's expense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6848.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it looks like we spent way more, but it's really settling contracts from years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6852.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: So all those numbers are very, very funny, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6902.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wish we could keep it open for as many years as we have outstanding contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6906.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm gonna just go through my list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6909.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for my colleagues who've answered some of the, have asked some of the questions already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6914.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: In the enrollment trends, how many of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6920.856s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm slightly confused on the kindergarten situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6923.137s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this year we had to add some kindergarten classes because we had some like literally August and September, like, I don't wanna say onslaught, that sounds terrible, but like an awful lot more registrants than we expected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6936.159s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so we added those kindergarten teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6938.599s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now we are not expecting that number to go down in the fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6943.38s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we not including those kindergarten teachers in this budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6947.981s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we're just gonna over the summer as a registration makes it too much for the current in for the kept kindergarten teachers, we're just going to go hire new kindergarten teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6957.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's the plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6982.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was just slightly confused on how that was working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6986.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page 13, we have four literacy coaches.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6990.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are not continuing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6991.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: They were actually vacant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6994.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: My question is, so do we have any literacy coaches at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6998.104s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unfortunately, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=6998.845s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have zero literacy coaches as we have focused on literacy for five straight years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7005.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, I see the assistant superintendent saying we actually have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7008.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7026.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7033.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7033.887s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7035.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page 14, member Olopade had brought up, I think he was bringing up like, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7045.993s">[Ruseau]</a>: Special Education Services, and I'm the Medford representative, I'm the chair of the Shore Educational Collaboratives Board of Directors, and you know, and actually it's like, it feels like it's actually just the Chelsea special ed department, because it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7063.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know, two-thirds or maybe even three-quarters of all of the SHORE students are actually from Chelsea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7068.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: And of course, SHORE is in Chelsea, so that's probably not a coincidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7072.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when we're in our SHORE meetings, we have talked about how districts come to SHORE seeking assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7081.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are a number of types of specialists, for instance, that are truly unicorns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7085.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe there's some for the blind that are like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7088.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, there's like two in the state or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7090.767s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when we think about in-district services versus out-of-district services, cost is always an issue, but sometimes cost is not the issue at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7100.412s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know Shore just hired somebody and I forget her title, but she does something that like all the districts around are very excited because they need those services for a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7112.378s">[Ruseau]</a>: So like, it would make no sense to hire this person full-time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7115.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: to serve one student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7117.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are very few of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7119.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we will be getting that service from SHORE, and they will employ that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7125.143s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's very complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7128.244s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe Chelsea also has space constraints for their special ed students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7133.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's a lot of reasons to do things in district, a lot of reasons to do things out of district, and certainly the least restrictive environment is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7141.069s">[Ruseau]</a>: But a least restrictive environment for which you can't actually provide the services<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7145.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, that's, I don't know what to say about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7148.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if you literally cannot hire a person to do the services that are necessary for a student to progress, then, you know, that's sort of a tough spot to be in, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7196.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they are meant for public school students, although I know that some, I believe most of those district placements are also students of the district that form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7214.41s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7217.492s">[Ruseau]</a>: Page 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7217.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7223.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, this issue of the two new positions for HR or payroll, you know, in my seven years, I have asked for more reports than is probably reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7234.737s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, it's definitely reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7236.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'll go out on a limb and say 90% of those reports are not things that we can get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7243.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're questions like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7245.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: How much are we spending on overtime?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7247.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Medford, both in the city and in the schools, does not have a modern information system for their finances.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7254.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: So Munis, which is just one company, but it's the one most people have, is very expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7259.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: A year ago, I believe it was a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7261.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe it was two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7262.584s">[Ruseau]</a>: We had a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7263.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was going to be $1.7 million to implement in Medford public schools alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7269.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that would be a capital expense and a massive training effort for a number of staff and like a 18 month project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7278.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we don't have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7279.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a lot of times we ask questions so that we can talk about efficiencies or the direction of the district or lots of other questions for which you need payroll or HR information for which the answer is you just can't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7293.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're not gonna have like a staff member and especially in a lightly staffed department<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7298.214s">[Ruseau]</a>: spend weeks and weeks pouring over data to type up a spreadsheet for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7302.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you can do that if you have tons of staff, but then you probably would just have mutants if you have that kind of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7307.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm very grateful for this because every time we have an increase for teachers or anybody, any other of our union partners and we settle it, and then two and a half months later, they haven't gotten their retro pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7322.449s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the new members haven't had this experience yet, but we get lots of emails as if you all are just like on vacation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7327.947s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in reality, when you have to give retro pay for three years for somebody who got a diploma in the middle of that and then increased in their step and then increased in their longevity, it is a painful manual process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7342.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I believe Munis actually makes a lot of that stuff very easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7345.259s">[Ruseau]</a>: And adding these two people for $150,000 is, I'd rather take these people and get Munis, but I don't see us coming up with an additional $1.7 million anytime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7357.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wanna get questions answered that we as a school committee really need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7361.652s">[Ruseau]</a>: One of the reports that I've harped on now for six years, I think, is a hires and terminations report, which my understanding from when I go to the shore, all the other members of the board are from different districts in the area, no other Medford folks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7377.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I get to hear how things operate everywhere, which is fascinating and wonderful and really upsetting at the same time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7384.755s">[Ruseau]</a>: They all get a hires and terminations report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7386.597s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of them monthly, some of them quarterly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7388.758s">[Ruseau]</a>: Shore gets it every single meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7390.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it says, who, what are the open positions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7393.883s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who left the district and why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7398.407s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, not like gory details, but like designed, you know, medical or retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7405.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who do we hire?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7405.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: A really important report for school committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7412.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: For Medford to do that, it is not a report that you can do because our payroll system is separate from our HR system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7418.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody would have to literally sit down and spend countless hours just to give us this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7424.125s">[Ruseau]</a>: And countless may not be the right number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7426.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you go on our website, there's a staff directory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7429.089s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do a search for somebody hired in the last few months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7431.551s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7432.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do a search for somebody who left last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7434.894s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7435.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7436.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because that and every other district is fed by the HR system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7439.793s">[Ruseau]</a>: or the payroll, whatever, or Munis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7442.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: In Medford, somebody has to have it on their to-do list in the HR or the payroll group to go in, run a report, probably make it look pretty, send it over to Lisa at, you know, and the web design team who will then like have some students work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7457.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's like weeks of work for something that should just be automatic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7462.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I very much support these positions, even though I understand, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7468.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: that there's a cost and there's an opportunity there that we're, there's a loss because we're including these.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7478.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: HR also does all of the certification, teacher certification stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7482.962s">[Ruseau]</a>: We used to have a deputy superintendent that did that, which from a financial perspective is probably not the most fiscally responsible person to be doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7493.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: But now we have HR doing all that and it's like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7496.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not talking about an HR department, like, you know, 12 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7501.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: I tried to look it up and my vague memory is that payroll alone in Malden Public Schools, which isn't that much bigger than us, was four staffers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7510.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so to say we're lean is really an understatement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7514.327s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we can't get the job done and, you know, I'm not gonna put words in your mouth, Jerry, but let's be honest, when there's not enough staff to get the work done, it doesn't get done<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7525.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: in a timely manner, which I'll save that comment for later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7529.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I definitely support that addition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7532.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I actually believe this is the third year in a row where we've been like, let's add them then because we hear the problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7541.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somerville's technology budget is $5.4 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7545.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we're talking about going from 30 to 100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7549.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: So Somerville has 500 more kids than us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7554.748s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's really staggering, frankly, to think of a school district with, what is that, 10-fold, more than 10-fold, 45-fold what we have for a small fraction more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7574.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not really anything to discuss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7576.754s">[Ruseau]</a>: We know we need to bring that number up, but we don't need to bring that number up $100,000 a year, because by the time we have a reasonable budget, Somerville's technology budget will be a billion dollars.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7587.64s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we'll never get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7590.302s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's an investment I really think we have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7596.564s">[Ruseau]</a>: put it on the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7597.244s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, that's the problem when there's not enough money, it's put it on the list and then you sort the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7602.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then these are the things that will never make the list, never make the actual funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7762.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7763.001s">[Ruseau]</a>: I certainly agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7764.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's mission critical.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7766.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is my seventh year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7767.542s">[Ruseau]</a>: I still can't use the internet when I go to Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7770.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've sort of wore myself hoarse trying to actually get that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7778.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, I have a computer science degree and I feel like anybody says that's not possible, like, I just can't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7787.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like, it's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7789.557s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, so is it possible for free?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7792.459s">[Ruseau]</a>: The answer is obviously no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7794.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, I did look at the number of nurses and changing gears a little here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7799.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somerville has<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7801.297s">[Ruseau]</a>: actually about 800 more students than us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7803.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is a year ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7804.238s">[Ruseau]</a>: They do have 17 nurses, and we're going to be down to 11.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7807.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do think I am concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7813.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: The guidance counselor ratios or whatever it was, the National Association of Guidance Counselors, we were better than that number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7823.936s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I always wonder about how those numbers are created.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7826.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are they like serving the whole country, finding the average and saying, hey, that's the right number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7831.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because you have states where there's 10,000 kids per guidance counselor or something, like not maybe 10,000, so many thousands of kids for one guidance counselor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7841.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: And same for nurses, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7844.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's sort of like, that's interesting information, but is that the right,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7851.454s">[Ruseau]</a>: number is sort of I think the question I think other people have sort of said as well is like, what is the right number, you know, and you know when when I talked to like, just people in the community about the budget and how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7865.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: how it's the most insane system ever invented was public school budgeting, because we have to have our budget done before the state tells us even how much you're gonna get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7873.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you imagine setting your budget before knowing what you actually have for income?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7877.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the feds, they're always a year and a half late or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7882.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we also have the, I don't think there's any other scenario where students can just show up<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7892.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is my big thing about calling charter schools public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7895.3s">[Ruseau]</a>: If that's true, then anybody can just show up and enroll their kids, and that's not true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7899.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: But tomorrow morning, 15 kids could show up, and we will educate them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7905.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe not tomorrow morning, maybe the day after.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7906.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it doesn't matter what our budget was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7909.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: And one of those students could require significant medical care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7916.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it doesn't matter if that's $50,000 a month or even more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7921.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I believe the number I heard was the highest was there was a student was running us $400,000 a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7926.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, that's, I mean, we still should be doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7929.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's what we have to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7931.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: However, when that student shows up in January and we set our budget in May of the previous year and we didn't have enough money then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7939.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: we still have to figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7940.704s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so it's, I'm not, this has nothing to do with the students at all here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7947.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: But my point is just that unlike any other endeavor where you can be like, well, we just won't do it this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7952.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like, oh, there's a road and it has a pothole and you're like, everybody's complaining.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7955.38s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're like, we don't have any money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7957.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: You wait for the next year and then you do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7960.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's literally not an option for schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7963.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: We will always do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7965.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if those students that show up mean that we have to increase the number of classrooms here or there, and it makes it so that we don't have enough resource, then we will actually cut somewhere else, because negative isn't an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7976.99s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because as you pointed out, you don't want to be Brockton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7979.412s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know if everybody knows what's going on in Brockton, but they had a $22 million deficit in the current year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7986.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: To be clear, that means that unless their city just rides in with a check, people are losing their jobs mid-teaching a class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=7994.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, goodbye tomorrow you don't have a job and we'll figure out what to do with the students stick them in study halls, I mean I don't know what's really going on in their schools, but you don't cut $22 million in the middle of a school year without it being a bloodbath frankly that that's that's probably what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8011.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, I greatly appreciate that you have sort of set the bar there is that we will not be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8018.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: this, like Brockton, and I don't know anything about their system and their school committee and their city and how they came to their budget and how they lost all that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8028.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's nothing to say negatively about them, but we can't be them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8032.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's lots of other districts that have gone through this much smaller scale, but I'm glad we won't be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8043.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: in that situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8044.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to, there's one other thing I've heard a number of times, and I was just laid off in December after 26 years from my employment, which I hadn't really disclosed publicly, but, and it's not been easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8057.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've never been laid off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8059.042s">[Ruseau]</a>: And frankly, I kind of thought I was in this job till I was retiring because big company and I liked the work and it was always work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8068.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8070.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: there's this amusing thing that happens in layoffs in private companies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8075.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I sort of hear it happening here is what are we gonna do with the work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8078.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: What are we gonna do with the work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8080.93s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's fascinating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8083.832s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like I had a great boss and I think a lot of people were like, well, we got to transfer the work from this person to that person who's already working completely maxed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8093.699s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we don't ever just come to terms with the fact that maybe the work won't get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8098.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: And obviously, students in your class, as a teacher, that's not really the scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8103.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I talk about, like, if we have to cut $2.7 million, I mean, I don't know where it's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8109.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if it doesn't come from classrooms, then maybe there's nobody cleaning the classrooms anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8114.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, that would be a worst case scenario.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8117.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: But like, the idea that the work will always just get done is ludicrous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8122.574s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's ludicrous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8123.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just not, you know, I look at these administrators and secretaries and other people who are doing work and whether there's too many of them for the amount of work and all that stuff is an important consideration for the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8134.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if, you know, this is public money, we have to be good stewards, but they were doing something and, you know, all those administrators, their work, will it actually get done or will we simply put it on their plate?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8149.235s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then that plate will just grow like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8152.29s">[Ruseau]</a>: some of those folks already were doing more than one job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8155.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in particular, I've been on the HECAT, the Health Education Curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8160.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: whatever the AT stands for, for the last year or two, I can't remember how long we've been doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8167.734s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we finished the analysis and I feel like we're ready to start talking about picking one and implementing one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8174.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the person running that is one of the people who is no longer gonna be at least in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8179.861s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I understand with the way movement happens that they may still work here, but they won't be working here in that role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8187.492s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that work certainly doesn't belong in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8190.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you're running the health curriculum and now you're running math, which makes no sense, you aren't gonna be doing the health curriculum too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8199.716s">[Ruseau]</a>: And even if we did say, hey, you gotta keep doing that, they gotta do math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8204.498s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we just spent all this time, we've heard from the community, the health curriculum here is not where we want it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8213.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And now I feel like, is it just,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8217.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: hope and a prayer until maybe someday we have enough money to actually implement a health curriculum that our students will have some clue what's going on before they're adults.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8228.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just deeply worried about that because we did just invest so much time and I just don't see how it happens without the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8239.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: I seem like I'm talking and not asking a lot of questions, but I do think it's important just to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8245.702s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that we have regulatory requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8249.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we do have to say, oh, the work is going over here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8253.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we also have to just be a little more honest about it actually isn't gonna get done though, because there's just so much time in a day, and it's just not gonna get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8265.495s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do wish we were more able, without getting the regulators on our back,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8270.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: to say, here's the pile of work, we put it over there, and let's identify all the work that will not get done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8276.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because then that's kind of a story to tell the community when we say, we need more money with an override or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8282.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they're like, you have now half the administrators, and you're getting it all done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8286.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why would you need more money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8287.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8289.667s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you can get it done with half the people, why would we give you twice as much money?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8293.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we just tell that story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8297.699s">[Ruseau]</a>: Instead of saying, no, there will be nobody doing this work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8301.78s">[Ruseau]</a>: And here it is on the pile of things that we might do if the city was to have an override and it was to pass.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8308.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we don't do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8309.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's a missed opportunity to be honest and transparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8314.444s">[Ruseau]</a>: We talk about transparency sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8317.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: endlessly, everybody has their own definition of transparency that, by the way, this is the most transparent presentation I've ever seen, but transparency does mean different things to different people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8328.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I think of transparency, especially around this job consolidation, as we're not doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8336.056s">[Ruseau]</a>: Instead of saying, this administrator is picking up two other administrators' jobs, and they're gonna get it done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8344.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just not able to buy that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8346.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so this presentation to me represents a disaster.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8351.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the $2.7 additional million in cuts represents a catastrophe, although I didn't use the dictionary to know the exact differences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8362.222s">[Ruseau]</a>: if we have to make the additional 2.7 million in cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8365.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm saying it out loud because, again, for transparency purposes, there are limits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8369.97s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can't have too many kids in a classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8372.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have a teacher's contract, maximum size classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8374.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not gonna be in one of these districts with 40 kids sitting on heaters around the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8381.141s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's never gonna be met, at least with our current teacher's contract, and hopefully just never.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8385.913s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we're not doing that, and we can't, you know, we have minimum manning for the custodial, which is reasonable, at some point we have to start looking at programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8397.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: And nobody wants to say it out loud, but if anybody thinks we're getting rid of math or science or English or history, y'all need your heads examined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8405.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8406.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: What's happening is the arts, the sports, those are going, and those are not 2.7 million probably altogether.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=8414.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we need more money, and I hope to never have to vote on another $2.7 million cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9054.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, it is three minutes, but if people could just give their name and address where I can try to keep up rather than watching the whole of the meeting again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9061.304s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9566.705s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if everybody in line is all the people that wanna talk, but I do, the three minutes is not meant to cut anybody off, but nobody wants to be speaking at midnight, so if we can try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9577.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wish we had a timer like you see in the State House, and I really, just not to scream at you when your time's up, but so you know, because I'm the talker, I go on and on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9590.722s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=9591.503s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just, you know, it's hard three minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12345.633s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12350.401s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12351.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: In my seven years, I have heard that our administration is bloated 7,000 times probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12357.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one superintendent and two assistant superintendents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12360.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's not another 30 people hiding in the corners anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12364.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: And while sometimes there are districts that do have different levels of these folks, they are almost always staffed by adding countless other people at lower levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12375.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, in many other school districts, every building has a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12381.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: grade level administrator, a grade level and disciplined level administrator, so a fifth grade science administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12391.188s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have none of those people in this district, none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12395.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, I mean, everything that the speaker had to say, agree with almost everything, but the myth that we have this gigantic bloated administration, it's just a myth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12410.399s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one superintendent, we have to have a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12413.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: We do have a director of people services, which is a legally mandated position for special ed and a few other things that she does.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12420.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we have an administrator for all of academics for the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12425.994s">[Ruseau]</a>: And look around, nobody has one person responsible for academics K to 12, other than Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12432.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we have another administrator who is essentially doing<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12435.865s">[Ruseau]</a>: operations, innovation, and I forget all of his titles, but so we are not bloated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12441.967s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in fact, I can't really fathom how we could have less administration and this school committee and all the school committees that I've been on in the past so far, like we throw countless things at these folks to do far greater than they could actually<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12457.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: get done, they do try.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12458.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I just think it's important to point out that there is not this gigantic bloated administration, we have one administrative assistant covering all of them, even though there's, you know, positions that I think there's supposed to be three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12475.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: there's one and they're covering all of those administrators and they're covering the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12479.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we of course also have a lot of asks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12482.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think it's just important to set the record straight on that because they're working like all the time and I can't imagine how we could have less.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=12492.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13032.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13033.272s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13035.273s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly welcome that in the handbook, but the law is actually not very unclear on this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13042.273s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would not want school committee members to have the open door policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13046.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: The group here right now is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13048.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: We wanna go on and look at some school committees around the state where you're like, that person should not be showing up in students' classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13055.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's why it's the law, is that when everybody's great and we'd be fine to have them in our class, we're all fine with it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13064.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: But really a key part of the First Amendment is it's the same for everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13071.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when somebody's on the school committee who's disruptive to teachers' classrooms, if that is just allowed, then guess what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13081.309s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're gonna show up in your classroom, they're gonna disagree with the way you're teaching a subject or the content you're teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13086.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that that is not, when we think about inviting school committee members into the class, we think of the good things that are gonna happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13095.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do agree completely that there are lots of good things that will happen, but it is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13100.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, at this moment in time I don't have a full time job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13104.034s">[Ruseau]</a>: How many hours a day do you want me sitting through your classes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13107.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think most teachers want to have me sitting in their classes for, you know, maybe I'm just curious how you teach or, you know, anything you can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13121.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: the superintendent must invite us, and most superintendents, I think, delegate that to lower other people within the district to be allowed that, but an explicit invitation like we did get last week, or was it this week for the, I don't even know, it's Monday, last week for the social studies presentations at the high school, we did get an explicit invitation, a couple of us were able to go,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13146.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was great, but I think that having us just show up when I have spot in my calendar, walking around the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13153.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that is not what educators want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13156.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also don't really think that's what students want like who is this this guy just roaming around.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13164.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: but I completely understand the intent, and I think if we can codify some way to make it more of an open door, like here's our intent, and then here's the process school committee members must follow, which would definitely have to include permission, because when we show up at a building, we are no different than anybody else in the entire public of the world, frankly, and have no more rights to be in that building, even if our own kids are in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13193.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you are not there to see your kids,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13194.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: You do not have a right to be in that building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13197.948s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't think that we can put it in the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13202.392s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think we can draft a policy that overrides that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13205.354s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we could perhaps come to something that would lay the path for how we could do it the right way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13212.987s">[Ruseau]</a>: and make that really open and obvious that like, you wanna go, here's what you gotta do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13217.17s">[Ruseau]</a>: Email this person, get an actual invite.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13221.233s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I just think that's an important thing for us to talk about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13225.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we can talk about it at the Student Advisory Council, because I do think it's important for us to get into the class.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13233.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13619.322s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13619.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13622.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't believe it was last year, I believe it was the year before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13625.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's this sort of question in Massachusetts law about, well, it's settled for city councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13635.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the city council just refuses to pass the budget, I believe it's 45 days later, whatever the budget was that the city administration presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13643.897s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, how many?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13647.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: just becomes the budget without the vote of the city council after a certain number of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13653.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, well, that's the city council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13656.182s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have asked our professional association, which has every school committee member in the state, and frankly, people who have probably been on school committees as long as I've been alive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13666.948s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, our previous finance director was an attorney and like, you know, we,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13674.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: It does appear to be an outstanding question if we just refuse to pass the budget, what happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13679.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: One option, one opinion is that on July 1st, without a budget, the district stops operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13685.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: Of course, school's not in session.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13688.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we have funds that are like, you know, not leftover, set aside funds for like special ed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13695.454s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a few places where we're allowed to save money for special eds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13698.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: One, I believe there's a transportation one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13700.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, like we could technically operate off of those funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13704.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: for some period of time, which of course does assume that we're a week away or a month away from finally agreeing on a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13711.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other opinion is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13716.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just becomes the budget even if we didn't vote for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13719.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like no school committee, and it makes sense when you think about school committees and if you've, y'all haven't been to our associations, but it's a group of people, nobody runs for school committee because it's a good time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13731.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: We run for school committee because we care about kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13733.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so for us to decide that we'd rather shut the district down,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13740.439s">[Ruseau]</a>: rather than take a horrible budget that at least is still operating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13745.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: It does appear that no school committee has ever just said, we're just not going to pass a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13750.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, it's it's it's settled for what happens with the city council 45 days or whatever the number of days later it just becomes the budget whether they voted for it or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13760.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for school committees, that is an outstanding question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13763.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'd like Medford to not be the first community to ever have to sit, go to a judge and find out what the right answer is by getting us enough money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13774.445s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not necessarily saying I'm, if we have to cut another 2.7 million and after the administration comes back and says, well, this is what that is, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13787.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe we will be here and refuse to vote for our budget and get to find out for the first time what happens in Massachusetts when a school committee refuses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13795.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, 2.7 million more than the horrible stuff we've discussed tonight is a number where I'd be like, fine, we won't have school until this is settled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13805.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because what is school if you've chopped this much?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13811.431s">[Ruseau]</a>: I hope we won't get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13812.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my understanding of the courts is we'll probably just lose and we'll just say it just becomes the budget is my guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13818.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it is an outstanding question and one that I think about a lot when I think about what it would mean to vote for a budget that chopped six, seven, whatever the number is, millions of dollars total.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S39QSClb618&t=13832.317s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=0.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think be voting to adjourn a meeting, because you need a majority of the folks to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=10.137s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, I live on the train tracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=13.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that the end of the meeting, people are tired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=17.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, one of the things that has happened in open meeting law is that failures to properly adjourn a meeting, there's plenty of open meeting law violations around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=28.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: like whole town councils, the annual meetings, they have to come back together to vote to end the meetings, really dumb.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=35.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanna make sure that the ending of the meeting is fully crystal clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=41.217s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only squishy thing here is that the beginning of the meeting, whoever's taking the role does have to have like a voting member, non-voting member on the piece of paper or the document they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=55.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: so that they can make sure there's a quorum of voting members to begin the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=60.071s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's very doable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=63.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just a little more complicated than I think I'd imagined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=67.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't have anything else other than this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=69.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: If there's stuff people think needs to be added or changed, let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=183.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: I already got it, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=270.964s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I changed the chair to actually be the SBC email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=323.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=324.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I think I've read that language before, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=351.941s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where am I looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=374.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I'm fine with just email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=379.375s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=380.076s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=382.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: Uh, comments and writing by email to the SBC.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=385.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=388.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll replace that with the name of the actual email address once we have one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=474.478s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, well, Robert's Rules of Order does say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=479.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: But one of the most common mistakes about understanding Robert's Rules of Order is that literally all of the rules can just be changed on the fly by the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=492.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: there's a set of rules of which can be completely thrown out the window at the blink of an eye, which, you know, if you haven't thrown them out the window, then we should be following them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=501.459s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, my personal opinions on this is that for subcommittees and, you know, I don't think we'll have committees at the whole kind of a thing for this particular, for the school building committee, but, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=516.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: I personally prefer first names and just the collegiality that we'll have in a small group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=524.824s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do think in a large group, when there's no public present and we're not making a big decision, you know, we're working through documents and, you know, I just, I tend to prefer more collegial, you know, collegial is not the right word, but, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=543.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: Informal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=544.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: Informal, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=546.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: But then, you know, we are being recorded and broadcast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=550.523s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm very much open to always using, you know, the proper, you know, member, all the party member team, you know, I mean, we don't, there's a lot of benefits to both in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=567.793s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it sometimes depends on who the folks are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=573.387s">[Ruseau]</a>: that you're actually, who is the rest of the committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=575.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, like if we don't have any kind of significant personality conflicts in the school building committee, I'll just, I don't know how else to describe it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=586.791s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like everybody gets along with everybody, nobody's interrupting anybody, you know, being less formal seems real easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=595.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the chair has to wrangle the group,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=601.88s">[Ruseau]</a>: on a regular basis, then that becomes more, it becomes less, you know, Paul, stop talking is much less, you know, doesn't sound great compared to, you know, remember or so your time is up or, and I feel like we don't know that stuff yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=621.487s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm all over the place, but that's just my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=734.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sorry, Tracy, I hate to ask you to repeat that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=738.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: The train was going by and I disconnected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=828.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sounds great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=828.951s">[Ruseau]</a>: I did, well, I think it was while Tracy was speaking, I realized there might be two exceptions I just wrote in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=834.372s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what you all think on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=840.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's correct, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1013.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a great question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1014.962s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, as a non-voting member, I actually,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1021.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't personally feel like I need to make my vote known how I would vote if I had been a voting member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1029.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the reason I don't feel that way is that when there is, as in the item just above it, when there's debate, I mean, it's pretty uncommon that people are going to be speaking on a topic and nobody knows how they actually were gonna vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1045.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's, in my mind, the role of the non-voting members is like, if I'm going to have any influence, it's going to be in what I have to say so that the voting members may choose to vote a different way or vote the way I want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1059.288s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't really feel the need for us to record all the non-voting members' opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1067.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: But obviously, when we go to the full committee, there can be a different opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1129.289s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I don't know how long it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1131.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're missing a lot, but that's because it's ridiculous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1230.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: I put this one in here, Jenny G. It's actually something we frequently have even in school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1237.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: And to me, it's always new members that are confused by this, but once the voting has begun, there is no motions allowed, no amendments, no conversation of any sort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1251.076s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you can vote no and then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1256.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then talk about it or make a different motion, but it's just a constant problem even with a small group of seven so I do worry about a large group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1265.737s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, being like I got one more thing after we started to take the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1312.852s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1313.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1316.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: I agree, except I do think it's important to include the most important caveat there is the only members that may actually do that are those that voted for the thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1327.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, in the winning thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1328.862s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if a motion was on the floor and it passes, the only members that may in fact redo this are those that voted for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1337.925s">[Ruseau]</a>: If it fails, the only members that may do that are the members that voted for it against it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1506.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do agree with that, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1507.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as I say one too many times, these are living documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1512.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: We literally can change them on the fly in our meeting with a majority vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1518.413s">[Ruseau]</a>: Perfect is not a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1520.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just going to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1683.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1687.504s">[Ruseau]</a>: The school committee rules can be bound in a book.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1759.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I mean, you know, I thought about this and, you know, one of the things that I struggle with a bit is, well, first of all, we're sort of onboarding as we go right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1779.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody is a current member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1782.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, we might be able to just like, I'm sure we have a list of things we could say we should have on that list, but it feels more like it should be just a living document as we like, somebody, as we are doing meetings and we're like, oh, you know, if somebody knew, if somebody was just thinking and paying attention to like, a new person coming in today without this information, they're coming in in a month, I should say, without this information,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1810.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, they really need it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1812.319s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's the onboarding of like, this is our set of rules that we just approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1817.22s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is, you know, this is the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1819.641s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1820.581s">[Ruseau]</a>: Here's everybody's names.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1821.862s">[Ruseau]</a>: Here's our email addresses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1824.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those things are basic things for a checklist, which I think we should draft, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1831.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: But then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1833.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: thinking about making sure that they're effective and then they could be coming in in year four of this project for crying out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1840.669s">[Ruseau]</a>: It makes me feel like that needs to be a living document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1842.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we finish all of eligibility and somebody starts two months into the next phase, we may wanna like flush things off that list rather than saying, here's your 7,000 pages to read now that you're a new member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1858.473s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's just my thoughts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1877.969s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I don't, um, I would rather just refer to it from here and have it be someplace else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1888.773s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, you know, cause I mean, you know, who would maintain it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1894.596s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1897.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: We certainly can start one now and have a list of, you know, the things that are going to stay the same throughout the entire process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1909.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: Payroll, you know, like the kind of thing you did if you were joining a company, then you sit at your new desk and you have no idea what ends up, even though you've got your account now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1941.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1942.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, but, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1944.018s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, I like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1944.498s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we can, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1958.593s">[Ruseau]</a>: meet as needed when we realize, hey, you know, this is no longer what the current list looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1996.939s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you see my?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=1999.66s">[Ruseau]</a>: You never know when I do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2002.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we have OML.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2004.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2006.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I'm just going to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2008.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: SPC rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2010.829s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2015.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: SBA process overview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2021.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: Issue email address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2024.599s">[Ruseau]</a>: Add to distribution list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2088.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I don't know about a press release every time we add a new member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2105.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, hopefully that doesn't happen often, but I do think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2165.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2175.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thinking about coming from this meeting and going to the full membership, I think my preference is that we actually, this is what we send them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2187.088s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then that the checklist isn't, they don't approve the checklist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2191.071s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want their feedback if they have ideas for more things, but it should just be such a living document that just changes on the fly as anybody and everybody thinks, oh, well, what about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2202.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rather than it being a policy that we have to vote on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2209.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I can certainly also, you know, if we're not gonna vote on this one, I'm not gonna vote obviously, but like, if this is not something we're sending to them for approval, then I can work on this list and making it look like something useful offline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2228.563s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't know if we have anything else to add to this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2256.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: Should we take the chair may limit to two minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2260.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the public comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2261.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want to keep that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2263.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not the members thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2266.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's down below.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2267.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2281.967s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2284.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2291.19s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like we've got something good here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2292.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2293.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, even though I assume that we all will make a vote emotion and vote for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2298.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will go through real quick and just even after the meeting and just make sure we don't have any typos or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2366.02s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2369.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: One more time, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2370.994s">[Ruseau]</a>: Stoneham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2374.475s">[Ruseau]</a>: Arlington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2380.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's very interesting as I looked around, I have very little time left.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2384.179s">[Ruseau]</a>: Winchester.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2402.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it looked better before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2438.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2439.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2451.205s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mohawk, did they do one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2455.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not it though.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2456.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: There it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2503.288s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, my subcommittee on that will be reviewing that, I forget, is it next week maybe, the week after?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2512.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because they did do that and, I don't know, I have too many meetings, I can't find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2521.575s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not tomorrow, I hope, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2610.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2611.273s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2612.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's a good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2613.849s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do wish they were a little stricter once you weren't a school committee member, but that's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2784.932s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2785.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the actual act of deciding, I mean, of selecting an additional member is not going to be in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2793.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think it's also not going to be, there's not going to be one path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2800.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if Jenny spoke about it in our last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2811.076s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2812.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, like if we lose,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2815.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, some kind of specific kind of engineer, and we have another specific, that same kind of engineer in the queue of people who applied, then, you know, the chair will probably want to replace them with that person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2828.492s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's hard to formulate, be formulaic about that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2835.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2836.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously that, you know, when the chair's asking somebody if they want to take a seat, you know, the meeting schedule will be important so that they can stay with the meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2847.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: But yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2861.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm not a voting member, but I'll just, I mean, actually there's two school committee members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/M_PcKAypdrM&t=2866.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't have to tell you all how to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=20.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello, everybody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=22.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the ad hoc subcommittee handbook evaluation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=62.97s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let me see if I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=69.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, why don't you, if you could read that out for me, since I don't have it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=97.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=99.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: Any questions or comments can be submitted to me, pruseau, P-R-U-S-E-A-U, at medford.k12.ma.us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=127.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: The agenda for today is as approved by the committee on February 4th, 2024, item number 2024-8,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=135.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee will establish an ad hoc subcommittee to establish a process and norms around annual handbook review for the resolution passed unanimously on 11-20-22.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=148.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: 2024, which was item 2023-26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=150.24s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if anybody hasn't lost yet, I'm impressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=154.982s">[Ruseau]</a>: That one said, be it resolved that the subcommittee will establish at the February 5th school committee meeting, we're a little late, and we'll work to complete the process as close to the original deadline of April 1st, 2024 as reasonably possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=170.571s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm going to take the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=172.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=174.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=174.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Reinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=177.791s">[Ruseau]</a>: Russo present three present we have a quorum so um you know um our charge is to draft well a document in other words a policy about how we would like to proceed with our handbook reviews each year and um<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=197.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: I did search other school systems and not surprisingly slash not surprisingly, actually, I couldn't find anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=207.38s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's very interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=208.36s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the law does require us to approve them each year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=211.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my guess is some years we do it in Medford, some years we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=217.627s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm betting that a lot of school systems are in the same boat, but hopefully we can lay that down and that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=225.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I have a draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=227.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: that I have been writing today that I will share.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=251.746s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=252.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I do that's thank you because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=255.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: while there's nobody watching right this moment, there might be somebody in YouTube and certainly people might watch this later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=261.009s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the way the intent is that school councils will draft a recommended update to the handbook and then those will come to the school committee for approval, presumably in the spring for the following school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=281.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that historically in Medford there, I remember one time approving handbooks or maybe two times in my seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=289.521s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it was sort of like, here are the handbooks, you have to approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=292.824s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=294.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they were at that time, they were all very different handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=300.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: And obviously middle schools and high schools and elementary schools have different handbooks, but for all four elementary schools to have different handbooks was kind of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=309.81s">[Ruseau]</a>: It wasn't just that they were formatted differently with different fonts and colors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=313.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: There were actually some policy and content differences that could not be correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=319.941s">[Ruseau]</a>: The School Committee has a policy, and in some of the books, it was the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=326.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: In others, it was<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=328.089s">[Ruseau]</a>: something drafted long ago or by a principal or a superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=333.451s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the need to clean that up has been an ongoing process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=337.392s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I will say that we are in much better place now than then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=340.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: The elementary school handbooks, for the most part, are the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=344.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: Content-wise, I believe they're pretty much the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=347.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think one of them is still formatted very differently, but honestly, that is not a hill to die on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=353.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: um i have a guess as to which one that is but we don't need to talk about that but i have it in front of me as well um but you know again i i do honestly feel like format and you know like some schools have they're named after a person others are named after a river you know like to have your handbooks look different i i could get behind that um but the content<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=377.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: needs to comply with policy, law, regulations, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=384.038s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's sort of the point of this meeting is to get a process in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=388.262s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when we review things, first of all, we know that all of the handbooks we've approved are, in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=395.97s">[Ruseau]</a>: complying with that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=397.792s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, there's always more interesting things like, you know, how does each school handle a drop off in the morning and pick up and, you know, every school's got a different physical structure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=407.941s">[Ruseau]</a>: So those would be different, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=411.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's sort of the baseline stuff that we need to make sure we have and that we are doing the approval that we're supposed to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=417.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's the number one most important thing is that we are supposed to by law put our signature on these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=425.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so we're gonna lay that out tonight, how we get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=432.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: So can you see this okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=438.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I am drafting a different policy which we're not here to discuss tonight and it just happened to have it was a schedule timeline kind of a policy which I'm not going to tell you about because of open meeting law, but I realized that it was sort of useful here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=452.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so there's.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=454.77s">[Ruseau]</a>: three phases in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=457.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, this is a dialogue between us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=460.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's the initiation of the update process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=465.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are dates that I just walked back in my mind when I thought would make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=470.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do expect the administration to have opinions on this, and we can change the dates, obviously, during the regular meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=478.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in my mind, sometime time between August 1 and September 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=482.088s">[Ruseau]</a>: The process will begin, and this is to begin the handbook update for the following school year, so I have that the superintendent will create a digital versions of each hand school handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=495.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know using the word digital here is kind of annoying, but I just wanna make sure we are clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=500.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: We are not talking about printing huge binders of paper that we're expecting to get anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=506.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so this is just a copy of the current, this is the current handbook that will be in use this particular school year that this is happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=515.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm going to use dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=518.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just gonna say during school year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=522.519s">[Ruseau]</a>: 2024, which began in 2023, this would be the current handbook we're using right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=529.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then the superintendent's office, and this is one thing where I'm not clear if maybe it's somebody else in her office or whatever, but that these copies, which I'm calling drafts, will be updated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=544.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody in the office will go through them, looking at school committee policy that has changed within the last year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=551.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: any district policy and for the uninitiated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=555.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: So school committees have a lot of authority over policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=561.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: The way the law is written is that if we do not actually say what our policy is, then the superintendent is the policymaker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=571.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just anything the superintendent says,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=574.994s">[Ruseau]</a>: goes as policy, I mean, obviously within the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=577.937s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's why I've separated them out here because there are plenty of things for which we may have a policy on, or we may make a statement about what we expect and want, but then there's lots of things we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=588.445s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, whether we should or not is unrelated to this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=592.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then district policy is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=595.451s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't want to put superintendent because sometimes it actually ends up being the principal, or it could be at a departmental level of like a science policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=605.68s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, so I just put district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=607.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do think the word district, it might be a better word, but I don't know what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=612.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, any of the changes that have to happen because of changing policies, laws, regulations, legal rulings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=622.423s">[Ruseau]</a>: those need to just be put into the drafts by the central office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=627.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't want seven or eight schools running around trying to find out what legal rulings there were this year, what school committee policies changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=635.33s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, that's just silly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=639.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that would be school councils doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=642.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are just volunteers from the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=644.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think that's the right way to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=646.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there's teachers too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=647.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a draft,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=651.749s">[Ruseau]</a>: that incorporates all of that stuff will be created by the central office, a memorandum detailing each of those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=659.033s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I do not mean, I don't think anybody here expects to include in the memorandum corrections to spelling and punctuation, but each substantive change, there should be an explanation for what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=676.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then a copy of the handbooks originally, which are the current operating handbooks, the draft one, the memorandum explaining the changes, and a copy of this policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=687.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: will be sent to each school principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=689.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the Roberts will get their version of their handbook with the required things and each of the schools will too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=697.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, each of the handbooks do not necessarily contain, you know, the high school handbook may contain things that the elementary one does not and vice versa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=708.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is the initiation of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=711.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: I suspect administration will have some tweaks to this and you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=716.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: The point is it starts within some reasonable timeframe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=721.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the most important things in my personal opinion are this memorandum of changes so that we are not being asked at the end of this to read a whole manual from a school and just guess what changed from the previous year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=736.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's an impossible task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=740.488s">[Ruseau]</a>: So next, those things go over to the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=744.755s">[Ruseau]</a>: The school councils and I'm not outlining how school councils get created and all that other business that's all the schools have them already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=753.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're expected to draft what I'm calling the recommended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=761.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Handbook, so they'll go through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=763.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: They'll have the document that includes all of the changes that had to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=767.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: And these are not changes that the school council is expected to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=770.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they'll have opinions on I mean, everybody has opinions, but these are not changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=774.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're going to if the superintendent makes an update because school committee changed the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=780.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: The school council doesn't undo it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=783.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's, this is just, they can make all of the other changes that they want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=787.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are many changes school councils recommend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=790.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: So they will go through the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=793.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: They will not be confused about why this language suddenly changed because it will be in the memorandum explaining it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=801.297s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they will generate what's called, John, go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=830.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, not feedback, the school council is responsible for providing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=837.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they may provide us, there's also this school council changes memorandum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=844.756s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if they make a change,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=848.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, a substantive change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=850.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm really struggling with examples.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=853.135s">[Ruseau]</a>: Make a substantive change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=854.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not again, not regarding the laws and policies and regulation stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=857.918s">[Ruseau]</a>: They make a change to the handbook and.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=864.143s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=864.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=868.486s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if it's not controversial, they're just gonna say, we've changed this and the principal and everybody thinks this is gonna work better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=874.19s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's one sentence and everybody's happy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=877.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: If there's anything more challenging, then I can certainly see dialogue going on there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=884.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the goal here is also that the school councils don't have to come and stand before us as a school committee for hours on one night.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=893.564s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not expected of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=896.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's also not reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=908.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=908.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they can have a concern, but the policy change isn't going to happen in time for this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=927.915s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I mean, the school councils, I think, are constantly in that mode all year long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=935.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I've not been on a school council, but I imagine that things are piling up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=941.446s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then when it's time to start this work, they've got their pile of things that they need to work through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=947.871s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's between them and, well, the principal is part of the school council, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=954.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: The listing is in the law, but I forgot it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=957.662s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, but so this is, you know, this is in every way divorced from school committee so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=966.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: So they'll create a memorandum as well that just explains their changes, not the required changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=973.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then they will send that recommended handbook<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=977.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: and the memorandum to the superintendent for review and submission to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=983.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't put it in here that the superintendent may have opinions on it, but my thoughts on that are this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=991.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: The superintendent and central administration staff are not 16, 25, 40 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=997.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: If a school council and a principal have all approved this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1001.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't foresee the central administration sitting down to review and decide whether they agree on everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1008.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a universe of endless availability of time and resources that doesn't exist in most places, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1016.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anyway, so I just want it to be like, superintendent gets it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1020.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: The review is if the superintendent really even wants to review it, and getting it to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1026.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up is our review.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1029.22s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I put a pretty big timeframe here, but I did wanna make sure it happens before we're in May.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1036.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: So for school committee members and you both are, this is your first term, but May has many names in school committee council, school committee circles, because that is when we get 750 invitations to every performance at every grade, at every school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1055.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: and every art show and every presentation from the social studies and the humanities and every single award ceremony.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1064.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: And May is both joyful and absolutely impossible for school committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1071.839s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in my mind, thinking about all the other responsibilities we have, I want this thing to be out of the way before May hits because May, I like May,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1081.727s">[Ruseau]</a>: if we're able to just focus on the students and the successes of that school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1088.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we also have to fit in countless other meetings, which we do, but let's limit it if we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1095.093s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anyway, so that's the purpose of the timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1097.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I put that the item on the agenda would be review and approval of school year, and then obviously the number of handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1106.379s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'll be put on a regular school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1109.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: digital copies of the handbook prior to changes, the recommended handbook, the mandatory changes memorandum, and the school council's changes memorandum will be in our packets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1123.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: School committee will take action such as approval amendments or postpone approval to a subsequent meeting or subcommittee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1130.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, I can envision that like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1134.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: early on, you know, the first year, maybe even first two years, we may be like, this takes a lot more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1140.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: But ideally, after we've done this, maybe even only one year, we'll be like, we'll all know to flip to the memorandum, we'll read the memorandum, we'll be like, oh, okay, well, that all makes sense, both of the memorandums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1154.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we won't be going line by line through, you know, dense handbooks from multiple schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1163.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously people are free to do what they want with their time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1166.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that obviously the first time you ever review a handbook, it's probably a good idea to read the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1174.959s">[Ruseau]</a>: But considering most of the content doesn't change, it's not a very efficient use of anybody's time to read it again from scratch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1184.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, but in the event that, you know, like title,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1190.742s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX, is that the one that's got major changes that just happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1194.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: There will be lots of changes that will come into our handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1200.227s">[Ruseau]</a>: We may, and how that language gets transmitted from the law, I think that's regulation, but how it gets transmitted from the regulation into language that the superintendent is putting into the manual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1215.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: we may have a real interesting set of conversations that need to be happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1220.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that may be like, we send that to a committee of the whole or a subcommittee just to discuss that specific piece, like how this really works in Medford or what we think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1237.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, a lot of times we will have no choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1240.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that during the previous,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1244.08s">[Ruseau]</a>: presidential administration, there were changes and we did not like them, but we also didn't have a decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1249.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: There was no decision making for us to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1252.909s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to make sure we had it out that at the end of this meeting, we will do one of these things to make sure we eventually do approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1294.964s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, we only can approve the whole handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1298.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can amend it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1301.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there a better wording for that, you think?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1321.235s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can approve one at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1322.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can just say they're all good and go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1348.793s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't mind that except in a lot of other districts, all the elementary schools have one handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1356.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's a lot of value to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1391.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: As you know, both all of us as well as the future school committee members will be like, what did they mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1398.24s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we, how do we do that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1399.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like, that's the whole purpose of this meeting so we can stop that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1419.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: What does... I think that the school council's approval of the handbook is procedural.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1426.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no, that doesn't make it the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1429.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't think sending it back is a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1433.375s">[Ruseau]</a>: We just can change what we want within the, you know, excluding the legal stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1439.46s">[Ruseau]</a>: But<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1440.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, being collaborative, I would certainly much rather us be like, let's invite them over to discuss this in a subcommittee, rather than just whole cloth, like tearing out something that they took pains to create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1453.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, that's not really ever something we want, unless, you know, in the weird situation where as a council creates something, and as a committee, we just, a majority of us disagree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1467.565s">[Ruseau]</a>: And,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1468.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, we could make such a change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1471.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know that we've done that before, but again, we've also not approved in a meaningful way before, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1584.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I mean, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1586.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1588.703s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, so if we assume for instance that there's nothing, when the superintendent in the first section is making updates, let's say that the superintendent does not feel that there's any conflict in that particular school's manual and that there's no update required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1607.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, the thing about school councils is they are volunteers and they are, and with anything where there's a volunteer<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1618.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: where you rely on volunteers, there's gonna be people who, the people who volunteer are interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1623.117s">[Ruseau]</a>: And why people are interested varies very greatly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1630.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: There may be people, there could be a whole pile of people who are volunteering for school councils right now because they disagree with how we did discipline policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1638.503s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when they draft language around that, they may interpret our policies in ways that as a majority of the school committee does not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1648.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: see that that is how we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1651.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the thing about language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1654.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: No matter how hard we try to be as precise and clear as we can be, there's honest interpretation involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1664.637s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then there's, of course, always not good faith interpretation involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1669.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1671.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: In my mind, if there's something going on in a handbook that is not a good faith interpretation of what we have in policy, well, then we would use our authority to make the change to the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1689.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I mean, my hope is that that's just not a regular occurrence or something we really need to worry about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1694.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I am grateful to these school councils that there's all this extra work that they're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1700.182s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, it's some of our staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1702.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, but there's always going to be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1707.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: an opportunity for disagreement between the school council and the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1713.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: And even though the law lays out this whole process, it is our approval that is required.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1719.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in my mind, at least I'm pretty sure that's the case, it is really up to us what they say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1726.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think nobody writing the law was gonna say school committee sit down and write a school manuals every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1733.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1735.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's the root of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1736.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, a superintendent could also read the changes and be like, that doesn't really comply with the intent of the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1752.812s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1754.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: because I think that that's, in a district where we had endless resources and that might be a thing, but none of us believe that that's coming anytime soon.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1766.343s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly, I would be happy if the superintendent's office had the capacity to read all of these things and really confirm that they comply with all of our policies, but it's a huge, huge undertaking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1780.533s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1784.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: Getting us through this the first time is the part that's going to be hard because it's going to be more work for every single group involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1794.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that once we're through it once, it should be dramatically easier.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1799.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aside from the fact that there'll be examples of what the memorandums should look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1804.78s">[Ruseau]</a>: People will perhaps number their sections of their handbooks so they can refer to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1809.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: There'll be page numbers everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1812.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of those things just happen naturally when you have to start writing about another document in a document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1821.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that won't be easy the first time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1825.041s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, like anything, like all policy, we go through this, we do it for a year, and we're like, oh, that just stunk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1831.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: What were we thinking?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1833.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's change it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1837.503s">[Ruseau]</a>: definitely happy to change it, happy to throw it all away if it turns out it was just not a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1844.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the most important thing to me is that we can approve these handbooks and approve them knowing what we're approving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1852.169s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's sort of the unfair thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1854.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like a Friday we get 400 pages of handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1861.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm a slow reader, but I think for fast readers to get through it by Monday is a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1875.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I would love this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1875.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: We could just use track changes, but I don't want us to get into the specifics of the technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1881.352s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then it also requires that school councils are all using Google.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1885.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then they don't necessarily have Google accounts with the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1888.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it just goes wild from there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=1937.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like that, a new phase three, superintendent, I'm just gonna put that as- I think it's just, what is the superintendent review?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2005.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's a heck of a job for the first time through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2009.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, well, that's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2010.531s">[Ruseau]</a>: How does that, just making it number four instead of a whole other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2013.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2017.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2018.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2019.894s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a really important point and one that has come up many times in my time as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2025.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it handbooks, the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2028.263s">[Ruseau]</a>: recess and homework.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2032.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2066.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2067.636s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that you just said something reminds me, like we want to make sure also that this policy is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2072.588s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, if all the hair books were perfect today, we'd want this to still be the policy and we don't have to like keep coming back and changing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2079.07s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, and that's why I like that consistency language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2085.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: But you know, the superintendent can, with this first phase, which I don't honestly know that happens at all right now, but if this first phase isn't happening and it begins to happen,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2100.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't mean the superintendent herself, but under her direction.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2103.563s">[Ruseau]</a>: But this cleanup of inconsistent language can happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2109.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's going to create a draft to send to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2113.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if it's already corrected in there, kind of getting out ahead of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2120.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's a process between her and I think the principals and school councils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2137.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: What else we got?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2152.185s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2157.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I think that might be a very, that might be a resolution we should work on is that we will draft a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2168.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: a handbook schema or whatever the right word would be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2175.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, we do it for our agendas and for other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2177.923s">[Ruseau]</a>: We say like, this is the structure we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2181.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: And some, you know, some handbooks, you open it up and there'll be like, mass general law quoted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2187.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, I think most everybody can agree that no,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2193.624s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you want to include it, put it in an appendix, but in fact, maybe just don't put it at all and just say what the law number is, because exactly two people per year are going to read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2211.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, but it can be at the end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2216.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: Stability of our handbooks, some of them is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2235.843s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2236.444s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, that's true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2237.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, and I think a nice,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2241.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: addendum would be great, but some of them it's very much like, welcome to this school, and then you see language on the Mass General Law website, and you're just like, what does that even say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2257.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2258.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that handbooks really do need to be welcoming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2262.011s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can't remember who was recently talking to about this, but they're like, you should open the handbook and read the first page and have a really a strong sense already of your expectations as a student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2273.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like it shouldn't be that you have to go 42 pages in, start to kind of grasp what's expected of you because nobody reads the whole thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2283.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's a different conversation, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2289.187s">[Ruseau]</a>: either for another policy or just for the councils to have themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2294.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe the high school principal is actually working on a whole new format for that one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2303.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I haven't seen it or anything, but I'd be very interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2315.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: Part of this is to prevent some of that from happening too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2320.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's helpful when policy respects all of the people in the process as people who have lives and other things to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2327.913s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I got that binder that the rest of us got, it didn't, and frankly, it just didn't feel very respectful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2337.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, really, we're gonna go through this and know what's different this year from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2346.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: and not to be unfair to anybody, but like the process as it's currently happening is not respectful of anybody's time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2356.281s">[Ruseau]</a>: So.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2367.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not saying we couldn't get hard copies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2370.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just, but you know, do you want to read four elementary<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2377.125s">[Ruseau]</a>: school handbooks when in fact, much of it will be the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2384.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're a fast reader though, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2408.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, honestly, that is sort of the expectation, that everyone is reading every handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2413.959s">[Ruseau]</a>: And in my mind, once we've done this once, everyone will just need to read the memorandums.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2435.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: yeah you know we've talked about onboarding of new members i'm going to move don't mind my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2441.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: screen going my video going out, because I need to plug in but um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2448.442s">[Ruseau]</a>: The onboarding of new members has been a topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2451.123s">[Ruseau]</a>: And actually, I have a Google Doc with a very long list of things for new members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2455.564s">[Ruseau]</a>: I did send some of the things out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2458.205s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the reality is that there's too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2466.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so figuring out how to deal with that is a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2475.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2475.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just, I mean, I would say it's an impossible list of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2480.655s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you know, when you go to a school committee conference and when you go to the, the, the, the, the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2488.239s">[Ruseau]</a>: Charting the course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2489.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: Charting the course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2492.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is a, I'm pretty sure it's a conversation that happens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2495.322s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I've been to several of them, but you know, there's this whole concept of becoming an effective school committee member and it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2503.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: It can sound a bit snotty or snooty, and it's not meant that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2511.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just that the depth and breadth of knowledge you need to bring all year long to every conversation and things that are changing is frankly staggering.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2524.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: What that means is you're adding more each year you're in office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2529.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: Nobody, I don't believe, and I would doubt anybody who says otherwise, nobody in the history of school committees has been elected and been effective immediately, maybe on an issue, for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2543.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: but not like on the breadth of things that we are required to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2550.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our list of presentations on our policy manual is several pages long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2555.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're supposed to receive all of those each year and all of us are supposed to understand and approve them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2561.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: It takes you a while just to read the list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2565.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2568.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: What we decide to include in onboarding, which I know we're slightly off topic, is we might want to have a subcommittee meeting on at some point, a different one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2577.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because how do you bring people up to speed so they are effective as quickly as possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2582.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because the truth is, is the whole committee benefits when the new members are effective as quickly as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2588.758s">[Ruseau]</a>: We all do, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2591.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, it's not that you won't have to ask the questions for which everybody else in the room already knows the answer to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2597.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's always going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2600.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2602.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, there are some basic things, and I don't just mean Robert's Rules and Open Meeting Law, that you kind of have to know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2613.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's nobody out there teaching them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2615.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: They don't teach them at Charting the Course, because every district's different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2619.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a really good question and a hard one to answer in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2624.557s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2647.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2648.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, our approval, by the way, I mean, I gave us a February, March and April, three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2653.445s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we get these handbooks and we get the memorandum, it's, we just do it in one weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2660.407s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not, we don't need three months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2662.847s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if they say they need more time in certain sections of this process, we have it to give to them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2669.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll just cut some of our time down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2672.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted it, I like going early and having them pat tough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2676.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2677.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: Otherwise, the councils are meeting in March to start talking about the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2684.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2689.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: and then we're approving handbooks the last week of June at best or just not doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2695.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't know if this October to January school council thing is reasonable at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2704.424s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, I haven't been on a school council.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2705.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't even know when they form and I'm sure they form at different times with each school and whether or not, if everybody's just coming over and staying around for another year,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2715.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: then, you know, oh, it's born, we agreed, and we're just going to keep the same council versus a whole turnover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2733.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, I, this is a, this is a, in my mind, this is a draft policy that if we report out of here positively, then the committee and the administration can respond to and I, I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2747.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we do approve it tonight to go to the full committee, I will ask the superintendent when I send her this document to send it to principals for their feedback, you know, to come to the committee or to email all of us so we can bring our notes on how we might want to change it at the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2768.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: and it's a policy so it would be you know first reading and then this is not what we would want to just waive the second reading we want people to have a chance to let it soak in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2804.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only time it is not or designee, we actually would say, we'd have to specify that only the superintendent can do something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2820.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's, you know, part of that is that also the superintendent is the only person we actually can have, we have authority over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2827.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, um, yeah, but no, we, we don't have to say that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2833.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, it's something that I very much wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2836.495s">[Ruseau]</a>: I, for a while when I was writing policy, I always went or designee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2839.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then I'm like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2840.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh my God, it's like putting the words Medford in our school committee policy everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2845.029s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have to remind myself to go take the words Medford out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2848.471s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's the Medford school committee policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2850.833s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously we don't mean Belmont.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2854.042s">[Ruseau]</a>: we'll do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2855.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the length of this thing matters greatly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2859.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: As someone who reads very, very slowly, I'm very attuned to this becoming too verbose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2869.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: Verbose enough, but not... I mean, there's also this...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2875.245s">[Ruseau]</a>: other conversation, we're off topic slightly here again, but like just saying the committee is actually sufficient.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2882.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: But whenever we're talking about things like this, where there's a school council, that's when I decide we need to go verbose because, you know, like with the school building committee, you can't say the committee, do you mean us, the school building committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2895.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you mean the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2897.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, I see that, that's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2900.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it's hard to find consistency because you'll end up with some policies where you're like, oh, you said school committee everywhere here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2906.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, but there was a reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2907.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2917.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2917.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you not see it all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2918.936s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2946.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where do I have three to mandatory?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2952.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: What's wrong with that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2952.94s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just kidding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2964.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: Funny, I thought I copied it and I had mandatory here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2967.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where's my I paid for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2970.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: What's my call it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2972.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thing that should find all my typos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2977.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: I thought so too, but I don't see it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2978.748s">[Ruseau]</a>: I must have turned it off by accident.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2981.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2983.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm gonna have to look at that,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=2985.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do rely on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3042.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I mean, yes, but again- No, I want this done by May 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3082.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: As I wrote it, I was like, how can I connect those things?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3085.104s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm hoping is a better way to describe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3087.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like to not use the word digital.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3091.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3093.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'd like to assume that it's implied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3134.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, we'll leave that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3141.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: Actually, I'll say there's copies of the handbook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3147.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not going to specify the format because some members prefer digital, some prefer papers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3152.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll leave that out of there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3153.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3245.936s">[Ruseau]</a>: How's that sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3248.777s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm going to resist giving it a name, because it's one that we may never see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3253.959s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, no, it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3302.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: Much better than finding out what I typed later was like, didn't make sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3307.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3328.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, we would, so let me stop sharing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3333.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Once I can find that, stop share, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3336.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I had to move to my bedroom where my power cord is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3340.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not going to do that horrible thing where people have meetings from their bed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3346.767s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the, I have too many windows open, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3353.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the motion, the basic motion would be to report out<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3362.742s">[Ruseau]</a>: Policy, BC, whatever the policy ID was, I just had it in my face a second ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3368.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3371.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: H-C, C-H-C-A-dash-B, C-H-C-A-dash-B.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3381.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: To report policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3386.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not positively, what's the word?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3404.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, so to report policy blah out to the full committee for... Adoption?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3413.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: Adoption with subcommittee, with unanimous, well, not with subcommittee recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3425.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let me read it out loud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3426.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: To report policy CHCA-B out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3435.34s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was the other thing that we were just talking about?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3443.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration and school principals, I'll just say principals, so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3472.318s">[Ruseau]</a>: meeting where the policy will be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3476.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: How's that sound?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3480.41s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you want me to read it one more time or do you all get that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3484.036s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can read it one more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3485.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I never like people- Second reading, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3489.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the motion, which one of you all would have to say so moved, to report policy CHCA-B out to the full committee for adoption with subcommittee recommendation for approval.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3501.101s">[Ruseau]</a>: A copy of the recommended policy will be sent to central administration and principals so they may provide feedback at the regular school committee meeting where the policy will be considered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3510.804s">[Ruseau]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3526.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3530.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, on the motion Member Ntapa.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3534.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3536.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3539.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, in the affirmative, the draft policy is reported out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3545.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you all for this wonderful work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3547.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: I honestly don't look forward to having to actually do all this work on the first time through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3563.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't honestly see this, we'll be doing any of this this school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3569.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3570.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, nobody's gonna be able to draft any memorandums at the timeline we're in right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3586.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, what we do this time around, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3588.229s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I think we may in fact,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3590.319s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, if folks get time to read them all, somebody definitely should make an emotion to approve them, but they have to be on the agenda for us to do that, and they aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3599.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, it's fairly awkward for me to say out loud in a meeting, especially recorded, that maybe we end up doing the proper thing in approving them this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3609.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Alas, we have also not done that for many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3612.57s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's not like I'm suggesting we break the law and do something that's never been done before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3620.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that, yeah, we can talk, you know, maybe you and I could talk offline about how we would want to do this, or you could talk to another member and say, like, so how do we get these approved?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3631.823s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we want to approve them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3645.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct, that's correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3646.413s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, looking around other districts, all they have is that same language, they have to be approved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3652.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: No comment about when, what happens if they don't, no comment about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3667.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not too late, but it's also not necessary because unless policy specific, I don't know if this is the law, but I'm, this is definitely how everybody operates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3677.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unless a policy says effective immediately, it is intended, implied to begin the next school year, July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3692.059s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK, well, let's take a peek.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3731.582s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3735.044s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rule 46, the policy will take effect immediately unless another date is specified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3742.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: However, I should point out that immediately, we're already past the end date of this implementation on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3747.77s">[Ruseau]</a>: So immediately does mean August 1st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3752.412s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can echo back to April.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3755.743s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I'm just making it up as I go, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3759.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: But since all these dates are now passed, I don't think we could reasonably think that we have to have done this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3788.792s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3789.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3790.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, when we passed the policy on out-of-school suspensions, we actually passed it in December, and we specified implementation for September 1 of the following year, because we expected there to be substantial effort to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3808.41s">[Ruseau]</a>: be in compliance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3811.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it's a really important question, is when does something start?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3814.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: And thanks for bringing it up and for reminding me that the policy I wrote, the rule I wrote, actually I had backwards in my head.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3824.038s">[Ruseau]</a>: So unless there's any other discussion, is there anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3839.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think we would do that because it wouldn't be on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3846.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3852.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3856.039s">[Ruseau]</a>: Probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3857.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we have not received yet the three updated handbooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3869.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: Timing me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3878.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3879.454s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then yeah, that seems like a really good time for us to get around to actually approving them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3899.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's outside the scope of our agenda of this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3906.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't make any decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3910.377s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is there a motion to adjourn?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3914.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/8X8NZBlcbA8&t=3933.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember, so yes, thank you all for a lovely and productive meeting and have a good evening and this meeting is adjourned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1142.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1143.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we met, we sort of felt like this would be a living document rather than something to get through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1151.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: As we move through the process, like, you know, when we've got shovels in the ground, some of these things may be irrelevant, but we want to make sure that it's not overwhelming, but actually appropriate for something to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1167.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: seats.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1168.556s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, I don't know if that was actually written somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1173.939s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is at the bottom right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1177.12s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we would just modify as we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1179.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anything that you think should be there, should let Jamie or me or somebody else add it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1186.565s">[Ruseau]</a>: It has to be a meeting conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1189.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1449.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: They were remarkably like- they reached out a whole bunch of other projects they were involved with, and I was looking for rules, so I didn't ask about any of the documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1949.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1950.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: The event table, I like that a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1952.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do think there are a number of businesses<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1955.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: get a lot of foot traffic where we put things up as well, like Colleen's scoops.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1964.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, there's probably others as well, be very supportive and have a lot of foot traffic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1970.669s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I mean, I'm shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1972.21s">[Ruseau]</a>: My daughter works with colleagues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1973.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm shocked how many people are in and out of that place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1976.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's wild.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=1978.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2362.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2364.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: One of the things that I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2365.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: worry about is the people who are like coming at us with stuff about the feasibility of reimagining they want to do now is, you know, when we get through that gate, we'll get through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2378.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, we will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2379.511s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're getting through that gate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2382.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: It isn't the time to then start engaging the community to start thinking about reimagining because like the race began and catching all those people in their reimaginings and interests<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2395.99s">[Ruseau]</a>: even though we can't do anything with them right now, so that on day one of that process, they're all queued up, ready to be hauled, because, well, I mean, it is just a lot of paperwork right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2411.036s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we don't hook them and keep up, because frankly, none of them are probably interested in paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2420.12s">[Ruseau]</a>: On day one, I mean, I know, when I run for office,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2424.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: two full years, I have people contact me and they support me, and then time to start my campaign up and I'm like, who are all those people again?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2433.432s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just don't want us to, I mean, I don't know if we create a shared document where we just add names of people who have interests, maybe a little note, how did you meet them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2444.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was their interest?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2446.157s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that when we have a reason to meet them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2449.83s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not all just like digging through our memories of this long process of reading documents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2455.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that my own, like, intent to do that every day falls flat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=2460.64s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think about that as a committee, something to formalize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3304.145s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, it's Wednesday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3460.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3462.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: The very stuff is just part of the ISP.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3469.843s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it seems different because it's a separate program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3472.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's got its own name, and it's in a different location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3475.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it's part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3477.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's how we're going to dodge that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=3484.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: I hope it won't be a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4657.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we'll have to feed all of that back into this before it's done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4661.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4661.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: The other thing about having space for kids from other communities, and I believe this happened with Everett, I don't know if this is before your time, but we have them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4672.501s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everett is coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4673.961s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Everett is like, wow, we're sending, I don't know, 10 kids over to Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4677.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maybe we should have our own program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4679.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: They start their own program, and then suddenly we don't have those 10 kids all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4683.445s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like this year, we no longer have them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4687.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a risk-free thing to build capacity for surrounding communities, especially if they have any capability to actually do it themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4698.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: If they don't have a case, if they don't have a vocational school at all, obviously the risks are very different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4703.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when they have something, or it's a program where the upfront costs are not exorbitant, just need a teacher, those I think of as more risky because it's not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4715.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: they just, they would want to keep their money too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4719.719s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yeah, there's no easy path, but like, I don't know if plumbing is one of the ones where there's no way to send kids anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/rzmG_N2g03Y&t=4729.845s">[Ruseau]</a>: Figuring out how to get a plumber to teach would be a problem, but there are opportunities, but they're not all risk-free.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=0.089s">[Ruseau]</a>: to make it today because of the prior commitment to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3.911s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I am going to get us going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=9.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: So wait, it's 301.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=10.234s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=10.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm trying to figure out, my kids aren't home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=16.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: So hopefully that will remain the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=20.679s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=21.38s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the May 15, 2024 subcommittee of the Fever Health<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=28.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: and special education subcommittee meeting for three o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=32.589s">[Ruseau]</a>: This meeting is being held via Zoom only.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=35.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: It will be recorded and is being broadcast onto Zoom as we speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=41.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do hear that I'm not alone anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=45.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: The YouTube link is in the meeting notice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=50.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=51.778s">[Ruseau]</a>: https://mps02155-org.zoom.us slash u slash A-D-D-N-A-W-M capital L-G capital Y. I think they thought that was better than the old way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=70.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if I agree.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=71.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anyways, if you have any questions or comments you want to send during the meeting rather than speaking up, you can send those to me directly at PRUSEAU at medford.k12.ma.us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=85.272s">[Ruseau]</a>: Please include your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=90.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: The agenda for today, as approved by the committee on April 29th, 2024, item two,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=95.754s">[Ruseau]</a>: Item 2024-22, be it resolved that the Special Education Behavioral Health Subcommittee will meet to discuss whether the Curtis-Tufts School should be co-located with the Medford High School campus to improve educational outcomes for Curtis-Tufts students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=111.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: Say that three times fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=113.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will invite current and former students and staff to provide<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=118.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: comments, but it also resolved that the committee will report back to the school committee on whether the credits test program should be co-located no later than June 3rd, 2024, because this information is critical to the progress of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee as it completes the district's educational profile.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=137.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a mouthful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=139.902s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm going to take the roll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=141.662s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Intapa is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=145.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=148.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: And member Rousseau is present, two present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=150.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have a quorum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=152.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have lots of people popping on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=153.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is lovely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=154.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: We usually have zero people on subcommittees other than those of us that have to be here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=157.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=160.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, I was trying to figure out how to run this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=164.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will admit it's an unusual subcommittee meeting because there's not like some policy we're updating or, but I thought maybe we could go around and introduce ourselves, those of us that are here so that you can say like why you're here, just for my notes, but also so we can have a sense of how to move the meeting along.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=187.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'll start at the top for me, which is of course different for everyone and that'd be Suzanne.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=219.289s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=220.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade, I just want to say who you are in case everybody doesn't already know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=236.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dr. Edward Vincent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=286.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=308.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=310.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a little fly running around, so I'm not losing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=312.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just like can't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=314.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up, I have Jess Ferley, Healy, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=321.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if you don't wanna introduce yourself or anything, that's perfectly fine too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=326.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: And actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=336.852s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, Jess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=338.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have Lori, but I believe there's more than one person there, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=369.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=371.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's at Travers Ed right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=384.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=385.81s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's good to know is in the room, little easier when we're actually in person, but then we all can make it so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=391.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, at the school committee meeting where we had this motion made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=399.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: really wasn't the point of the topic or the conversation going on, but there was, I forget the person's name, who is not actually able to make it here, is the director of the program over at Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=411.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I believe in Somerville, they used to have a program separated very much like we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=416.187s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then when they rebuilt Somerville High, are they actually done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=419.41s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's been the longest project in history, it seems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=422.372s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when they rebuilt Somerville High, they added<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=426.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if it's a wing we haven't actually taken a tour yet for their alternative high school students and apparently it has been beyond wonderful he described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=439.434s">[Ruseau]</a>: dramatic increases in participation of those students in extracurriculars, you know, sporting and club presidents and things that are very difficult when you're not located with the rest of the student body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=452.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: And obviously we'll want to take a peek at that if we do make this recommendation so we can have that information for our MSBA project for a re-imagined high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=464.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that was sort of,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=467.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was nice that he came because it was very surprising.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=469.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really had no strong sense of this issue, other than the facilities of the Curtis Tufts are challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=479.812s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wrote<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=480.745s">[Ruseau]</a>: Four things, three things down, opportunities for students, which I just spoke to, facilities, which, you know, facilities at Curtis Tufts versus Medford High is one thing, but the facilities of the Curtis Tufts at a perhaps glossy, beautiful, new Medford High would be a different juxtaposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=501.871s">[Ruseau]</a>: This little fly is gonna make me crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=505.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anyways,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=508.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we talked, I had talked, I can't remember with who about, you know, if we did bring the school over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=516.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: bring them together, maybe we can have a separate entrance, separate start and end times, some kind of partitioning if that actually is appropriate and okay and works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=526.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there were ways to retain, what I have heard is that the students in the Curtis Tufts and at other alternative high schools, the key for them is they're not with the rest of the student body or maybe even some of the staff, that they are in fact not there, that's the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=546.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think I'm done talking and I would like to hear what anybody else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=548.824s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=549.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowman, would you like to give us a little history lesson?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=715.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, that was helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=717.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=718.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: on the school committee in 1982.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=719.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was 11, but so that's wonderful history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=726.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would just ask, do you have any data on the size of the student population served during that time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=734.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I realized it varies dramatically even within a single year, but did it used to be much bigger or was it just two or three students when it started?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=785.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=788.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=789.597s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, mostly I know about the Curtis Tufts when we used to go for the delightful Thanksgiving dinners, which I, no pressure, but I would love it if those started again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=798.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really very nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=803.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'd like to hear from the staff, I think is really an important folks too, who are there every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1054.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1056.942s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade, anybody else have questions before I go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1062.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: The buffer wasn't good enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1065.104s">[Ruseau]</a>: Really, that's a key element of this conversation, frankly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1070.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you describe what it was like there that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1074.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, was it just everybody came through the same main entrance of the schools or how was it laid out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1079.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm not asking for an architectural drawing or anything, but help me understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1352.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was, I mean, honestly, like the number of things to consider, like the fire drill location for these students, honestly, it would never have occurred to me, not that I'm asked to, but clearly there are a million and one little things that have to be considered if this decision is to co-locate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1373.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not just a matter of a set of classrooms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1422.059s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1422.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was a remarkably helpful set of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1427.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that, you know, when we're reimagining Medford High School, whether we rebuild or renovate, obviously nobody's surprised to know that I want to rebuild the new building, but, you know, like a separate entrance, that was like my thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1445.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are really a long list, by the way, if we make this decision, I think it might be helpful for current Curtis Tufts staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1453.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: to just open a Google doc and start writing all the things you can think of, which may be important inputs to a design of a structure that, you know, those of us that are not there wouldn't consider because while we're not at the phase now where we're not doing the feasibility study right now and what the building might look like or where it would be or any of that stuff, that's all gonna come and that's gonna happen<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1480.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's gonna just, once we get through this first phase of eligibility, which is proving that we can do this work, it feels like that's gonna happen just like all at once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1495.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so any headstart you can get on a list of things that you think are important considerations in the design of a space, if that is inside or co-located.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1508.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't know the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1509.948s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't know if the state would physically a separate building right on the same property.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1515.712s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think any of us know the answer to what they think is acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1520.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think about things like food services, you brought up nursing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1524.699s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are other services for which having that, whether it's a separate wing or whether there's a little bridge, we talked a lot about bridges in one of our meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1534.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody wants a bridge to their own program now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1537.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: which why not, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1539.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: But yeah, if you can, I'm guessing that like most of us, you will think of something you wish you had said later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1547.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: So write those things down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1548.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: You can send them to me or open a Google doc for your staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1551.568s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cause I think that'd be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=1555.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: Go ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2107.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2107.395s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2107.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a lot to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2130.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2133.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: Lori, did you want to speak on anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2442.401s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2443.662s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2444.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: All that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2445.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: Aaron.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2738.507s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2738.967s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, that rule of 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2741.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, that's, I mean, it'd be interesting to, I mean, Aaron was a student not so long ago, but my guess is that 30 years is long gone, but I suspect that reputation is still there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2772.695s">[Ruseau]</a>: So- So having it in the same location would actually make a big impact on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2860.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: That used to be one heart, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2861.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: Zoom just changed it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2864.519s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was a flutter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2865.399s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=2918.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I'm happy you've made that choice, because I think choosing something is different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3049.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3049.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3052.46s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just trying to keep an eye on the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3058.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anybody else want to add anything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3062.346s">[Ruseau]</a>: This isn't like the only opportunity you'll ever have, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3067.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, I think that what I'm hearing, and frankly, so far I've heard really nobody arguing against us recommending this, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3080.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: We, you know, the way this would work is that one of those two school committee members make a motion and second it, and then presumably we would vote for making that recommendation that would go to the full school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3092.395s">[Ruseau]</a>: The school committee would make the policy decision that that is the goal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3099.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not like, you know, this isn't happening in September or anything like that, and that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3105.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: From there, that would become part of our educational profile for the new building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3110.285s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then of course, we're gonna probably have to really spend, we already spent a lot of time together, the people in this Zoom with me, but we're gonna have to spend even more time together to really, until we have like a site study and that stuff that happens in the next phase where we like, well, where could we put the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3131.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, could we renovate, which, whatever, you know, those are the kinds of starting points it feels like, you know, I like the bridges idea all over the place, metaphorically as well, but, you know, depending on where it is, it may not be possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3149.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I feel like, you know, we're gonna have to really dig in once we get to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3156.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know that for the eligibility phase, for the educational profile,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3161.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how much detail we have to actually go into in that, but we'll meet and discuss that, assuming that it passes tonight and that the full committee supports it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3173.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: I took copious notes, although there was so much more said, I'm sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3179.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will try to write these up and just kind of highlight the, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3186.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: The key points in the event that the full school committee wants to really get into a dialogue about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3192.592s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if they if they don't they just want to like, I don't say rubber stamp because that's that's such a negative connotation but if they just want to like yes we agree and move on, then we won't necessarily go through this whole presentation at the school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3209.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: this certainly will not be the last.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3211.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: I feel like this is just the beginning, frankly, of this conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3215.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's not a six-month or a year-long conversation, which I think is good, because I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3225.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: I try to remember who said this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3231.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: might've been Lori, forgive me, I forget who said this, but I do strongly believe that every one of these kinds of opportunities, whether it's a new high school, whether it's bringing the Curtis Tufts into the same campus, that there is no reason for us to not be an exemplar to other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3251.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: And even why limit ourselves to Massachusetts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3255.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was just looking at a video from a school in Oklahoma<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3260.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, very different kind of a setting and they have a lot more land and all this other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3264.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there's no reason that when we're all done and we're all moved into a nice high school or new high school, that communities around the state and country aren't going, oh, look at this place, we could do this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3278.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, sometimes it would be difficult to put into a fun video when we're all done<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3287.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, that makes a news story.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3289.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's hard to put some of this stuff in particular into that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3292.914s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, are we going to really, is it, you know, is the news, you know, very, very brief stories going to include stuff like we brought our alternative, Joan, correct me, is it alternative high school therapeutic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3305.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: Therapeutic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3306.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3307.343s">[Ruseau]</a>: I got to stop and fix that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3309.024s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a note to remember to start calling it that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3311.753s">[Ruseau]</a>: therapeutic program into the main campus, that stuff's not going to make it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3317.699s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that doesn't mean we can't have a white paper when we're all done and say something so we can really help people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3322.764s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're reaching out to other school committees and other districts a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3330.492s">[Ruseau]</a>: How did it go?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3331.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: What do you recommend?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3332.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: So they're going to be doing that to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3334.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think if we can really show that we did this and we did it really well, you really should consider it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3341.376s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that does a service beyond just our students in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3346.879s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I greatly appreciate it when other places do that for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3350.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they are very giving, sometimes surprisingly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3353.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, can we have five hours to roam your school with you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3356.022s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, and then you have half their staff and they're like, don't you all have other things to do?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3360.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so if nobody has anything else they want to add, if member Olopade would like to make a motion to recommend that the Curtis Tufts, I'm writing it down, the Curtis Tufts be co-localized, I am in love with that by the way, co-localized with the main Medford High School<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3390.97s">[Ruseau]</a>: campus, because it is part of Medford High still, you know, I just, does that language sound okay to the folks that understand this stuff in detail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3399.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: Good, okay, I saw a thumbs up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3401.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if member Olopade would like to make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3420.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: just typing it, but I wanna have Mr. Don't vote if we don't know what we're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3425.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: Recommendation to co-localize Curtis Tufts with the main Medford High School campus by member Olopade, seconded by member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3443.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3447.93s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3449.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: member so yes to win the affirmative the motion is approved um and anybody have any final words or we're going to get two whole minutes back all right i appreciate everybody's time today and uh this has been a fabulous meeting especially since i was completely convinced i have no idea what we're going to talk about um so thank you all take care thank you thank you have a good night i've got to adjourn member al-fadi motion to adjourn<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/sV7fY9kw9y0&t=3479.733s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hey, it's not good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=383.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=393.042s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=395.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=397.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: Student rep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=398.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're asking us also, Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=570.286s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's on the agenda and it's quite long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=572.486s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to talk about it too, but if you wanna read it, you're welcome to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=593.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=594.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the, sorry, as I have to take the minutes at the same time, give me just a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=604.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=606.704s">[Ruseau]</a>: When did we actually meet on May 8 to discuss the process for doing school handbooks the school committee is required annually by law to approve school handbooks, and we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=619.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: done that some years and not done that some or many years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=622.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we worked up a process we reviewed I reviewed, I took some example policy from other districts, notably Cambridge, and worked up a timeline policy that we, the rest of the committee members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=638.792s">[Ruseau]</a>: fleshed out the synopsis is that there's three phases of the handbook process that we would like to see implemented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=648.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: The first phase is the initiation of the handbook update process, which the superintendent's office will manage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=655.619s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's quite a long date range of August 1st to September 30th for them to accomplish that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=661.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then those go over to the school council the site camp, school councils excuse me at each of the buildings, and those individual councils one of their required, but one of their tasks as a school council is to draft changes to the handbook, and they get a pretty big.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=679.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: October 1 to January 31 is the expected time when they would do that work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=685.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then finally, this comes back to the school committee for approval sometime between February 1 and April 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=690.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a whole, there's a lot of language, but those are the most important things, is that there's dates and there's expectations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=699.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that the big improvement here, aside from having dates, the big improvement is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=705.965s">[Ruseau]</a>: there's these two memorandums that will accompany these changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=709.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the laws change every year, court cases, et cetera.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=715.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so we often have to update our school handbooks because we don't have a choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=720.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when the school councils, and I've heard this from school councils, they make these changes and they don't have any idea why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=728.609s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there'll be a memorandum that goes to them explaining exactly why these are changes that you don't really have a choice on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=736.07s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then if the school council wishes to make further changes to the handbooks, you know, things like school pickup at elementary schools, they would also write that up so that when we get the actual handbooks for approval, we're not reading them like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=751.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: just this gigantic set of documents with no idea what changed from last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=756.281s">[Ruseau]</a>: So hopefully that will improve the process and make it so that we actually do the approvals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=762.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I mean, all the school handbooks stacked together is quite a thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=766.81s">[Ruseau]</a>: And having no clue what changed year to year is, is sort of a monumental task.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=771.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the policy proposal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=774.596s">[Ruseau]</a>: The<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=777.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't have administration in the meeting, and that was on purpose, because we wanted to just focus on what the school committee wanted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=782.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the dates do not work for the administration or the school councils, we're certainly happy to hear feedback on that, and adjust those dates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=793.383s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that is the synopsis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=806.032s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve first reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=861.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=864.798s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the last school committee meeting was the last one, I believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=867.883s">[Ruseau]</a>: Actually, it's in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=871.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: On April 29th, not the last school committee meeting, there was a resolution to have the subcommittee discuss the possibility of co-locating the Curtis Tufts with the Medford High School when we are actually re-imagining slash rebuilding Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=892.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there were a lot of reasons for that, such as some of the more obvious ones is that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=897.346s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Medford High students not at Curtis Tufts would be in a beautiful facility and the Curtis Tufts is if you've seen it is not exactly that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=905.473s">[Ruseau]</a>: But facilities aside, they were all these opportunities that Curtis Tufts students cannot actually participate in or it's very, very difficult to get across town between classes and club participation is low.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=921.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: At the last meeting there was also the director of the program in Somerville, and they used to have a separate program like Medford does, and they co located when they built a new Somerville High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=932.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the reviews were amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=935.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, students, their therapeutic learning program are captains of sports teams, participating in all of the clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=944.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the quality of educational experience for those students went very much through the roof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=951.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we listened to, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=955.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe it was a survey or just maybe just gathered information from current students, staff were in the meeting of the Curtis Tufts, and the, in my opinion, the unanimous opinion of everyone who participated was that this made sense to make this recommendation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=972.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, this is the recommendation of the subcommittee that we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=977.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: co locate the Curtis Tufts, at some point, probably when we do the high school over with the main campus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1864.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1865.656s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to comment that I feel like I see Jonah more than some of my own children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1871.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everywhere I go I see Jonah whether it's in a play or at the State House on May 10 or the ninth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1878.487s">[Ruseau]</a>: sixth, whatever, he seems to always be everywhere, which is sort of what you'd expect from our students who are, and not just Jonah, there are several other students who are also at the Statehouse, and I don't think that's a CCSR project, but you know, they're<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1896.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: participation doesn't just start and end with the club times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1901.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's really impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=1903.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do wonder how anybody manages that much in their schedule, but thank you for all of your efforts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3778.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3781.674s">[Ruseau]</a>: The headliner for me was actually the survey, and while there's lots of good stuff in there, but in the survey data, everything went in the right direction, everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3792.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's really awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3801.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is your first principal ship right first, so I think there's, you should be very proud.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=3808.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, one, not even a full school year, and it's, I'm impressed so I just, there's a lot in here that's, we could talk all night about but the survey data I've been waiting with bated breath, and thank you for the great work you've been doing, and I look forward to what you can do in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5326.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5327.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: Number Brantley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5329.588s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5330.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember on top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5331.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5332.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember all about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5333.292s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5334.233s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember rental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5335.915s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=5336.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, Marilyn go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6823.289s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6823.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: I greatly appreciate the presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6827.251s">[Ruseau]</a>: The additional clarity is always welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6830.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: As I said in the last meeting, I am deeply grateful that you have removed some of the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6842.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: removed the veil of solvency that we have lived with in Medford for a generation or more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6851.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we have an expense of $2 million, we have a line item of $200,000 to pay for it, and we pay the $2 million, it is reasonable for the public to conclude that we didn't need that money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6865.624s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we got that other $1.8 million by scraping it out of this leftover grant for,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6871.963s">[Ruseau]</a>: know, reading or whatever we you know we scraped it up from all of these other places, and so that when you look at our budget, you think we spent $200,000 on an item that actually costs $2 million, and that is the opposite of transparency in any and every sense of the word no matter what you think transparency means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6892.051s">[Ruseau]</a>: And believe me, everyone in this room has a different definition of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6896.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: We all do agree probably that if something costs $2 million, we will tell you it costs $2 million, and we'll put a $2 million item in the budget to pay for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6906.025s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that has not existed in Medford public schools for as long as I've been here for seven and a half years and my understanding is for long before that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6915.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's an incredible disservice to the community to continue thinking that something that costs $2 million is only going to cost us $200,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6922.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that is the, you know, as horrible as this budget is that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6932.506s">[Ruseau]</a>: frankly, I can never thank you enough for that, because it is something for my seven and a half years I have been asking for, and it has not been something that I've been able to get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6946.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in light of that, and in light of the fact, you did say one other thing that, you mentioned whether it was a reasonable request, the $79 million, and we can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6963.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: Your job is your job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6965.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in my opinion, the request is the school committee's request and we sort of decide what's reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6972.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, in light of that, I'm going to make a motion that the Medford school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Metro public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=6986.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: In 2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the member city council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7034.915s">[Ruseau]</a>: Certainly, so I'll read the language and then explain it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7039.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Zoom keeps coming in and out for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7042.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Medford School Committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the responsible operations of the Medford Public Schools in 2024-2025 be submitted in writing to the Medford City Council and the Mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7059.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that is the number that was calculated and displayed at the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7064.736s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is the number that was on one of these slides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7067.178s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do have a spreadsheet that I've shared with Dr. Cushing, if he could put it up, which actually explains that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7078.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you get it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7080.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's because my Zoom is in and out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=7082.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, one second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8185.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, member Bramley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8186.076s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8187.056s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8187.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to clarify, ask a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8190.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: So as the finance, technically the finance director right now, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8195.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8196.3s">[Ruseau]</a>: You made none of these decisions, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8198.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pardon?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8198.901s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you make any of these decisions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8280.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8281.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that, you know, all of us here have received many emails.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8286.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: And some of us here have discussed disliking, well, we all dislike the cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8293.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that, you know, if in fact, we do not get more money from the mayor, from the city budget, this is nowhere near enough cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8302.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: And even if we got enough to avoid additional cuts,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8307.262s">[Ruseau]</a>: any additional, if we decide to keep any position, it is a different position that must be cut, well, equivalent amounts of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8315.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think it's important to remember that, and that group of people, just to clarify, Mr. McHugh, did not include school committee members, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8326.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8326.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8327.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's important because, you know, there's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8331.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: not to be defensive, but as the senior member, which Paulette used to do that, I guess it's on me now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8338.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really important to note that we're not in the rooms making these decisions, that we hire the superintendent and it is the superintendent's job to present a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8349.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we can vehemently disagree and we can vote or not vote for the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8356.239s">[Ruseau]</a>: In the last budget hearing,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8359.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: I made a statement that in Massachusetts, no school committee has refused to pass a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8365.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there was no understanding of what happens on July 1 if we refuse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8371.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: In that intervening two weeks, Uxbridge actually did not pass a school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8377.581s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are sending out layoff notices to all their staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8382.123s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the state has said on July 1, they have $0 and will not have a school district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8388.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's really hope for Uxbridge that somebody passes a special law to find a way around this for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8396.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do not envy them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8397.961s">[Ruseau]</a>: But unfortunately, the answer we now have from their disaster they're going through is that if we do not approve any budget on July 1, the Medford Public Schools closes every employee, HR by the way included.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8413.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if you have a question about your benefits, too bad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8416.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: the superintendent, everybody goes home until we figure out how to pass a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8422.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are not in a situation where we can grandstand, and I don't mean that in any way, but sometimes, well, I mean, frankly, all of us grandstand at different times, but we can disagree with this all we want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8437.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we do not pass a budget by July 1, there will be no public school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8442.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's kind of hard to wrap your head around because you're like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8446.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's the law, there has to be one, but the state just clarified in the last two weeks to Uxbridge that no, there actually, you will have zero dollars to spend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8455.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: Nobody will get a paycheck.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8457.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: There will be no HR person when you have a change in benefits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8460.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's kind of a catastrophic level of anarchy almost that is hard to comprehend, but, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8471.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sort of glad it's not us that's going through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8473.716s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, we're going to try and get more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8476.737s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's what my motion is for, is to do that level service budget, so that we have dramatically fewer layoffs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8487.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: But at the end of the day, if that number is how we are given, we either pass a budget that we dislike immensely,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8495.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: or there's no map for public schools on July one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8497.849s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are the two options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8500.291s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I have a spreadsheet I shared with Dr. Cushing if he wouldn't mind sharing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8599.11s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct, level service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8601.011s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8601.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it also adds,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8604.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, some of these things were things that were savings like for literacy interventionists we don't actually have any right now, even though we had budgeted for them so this adds them back in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8614.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then for professional behavioral specialists as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=8618.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10118.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: We've been asking for additional payroll and business staff for years now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10123.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we are the ones that hear that we pass a union, we get a ratified union contract and it can take months before people get their check.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10133.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: And maybe in 1950, that was 100% reasonable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10138.761s">[Ruseau]</a>: In this day and age, if it's less than a week, something's really, really wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10144.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: You type the numbers into a computer system, it does the calculations, but we don't have that in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10152.369s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, considering how manual it is at the moment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10157.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need more staff because so folks should not have to wait weeks or months, get a partial for the retroactive stuff and then another month goes by and they get their longevity from three years ago, and it's like nobody can figure it out if you're especially on the receiving end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10176.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Last, I believe it was last year, we had a presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10181.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: I forget who gave it to us, but we had asked for a, what would it cost for Medford public schools to become modernized computer systems, munis is the is pretty much what everybody buys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10196.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10198.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: 18 months and like 1.7 million I think if my memory is correct to buy the software to train all of the staff to have the consultants helping all of the staff because you know like the payroll will have to happen the day after we have Munis and with all the training in the world you can't just like walk in and just make it happen so we definitely you know and if we had Munis we might<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10223.319s">[Ruseau]</a>: We may be able to reasonably have conversations about adding staff, but when I look at other districts, Malden I believe has 20 people in their business office, they're not much bigger than us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10238.049s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10239.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10239.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10241.572s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's not less work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10242.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's more work here because we don't have the systems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10246.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I know that choosing between nurses, administrative assistants, administrators, teachers, and the business office is a pretty ugly choice to have to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10261.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when people are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10264.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: become employed here, it'd be nice if they could start getting a paycheck within a reasonable number of weeks of actually being an employee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10271.143s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or when you retire, it'd be nice if you can find out, hey, can I retire now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10277.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we can help you instead of by the time you get an answer, you've already decided, well, I guess I'm not retiring this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10284.31s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it is an ugly choice, but it is one we have been pushing for for several years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10290.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope we can keep that in the budget because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10294.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: In addition to everything I just described, the school committee has asked for reports that are not possible with the staffing levels we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10301.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of them are possible because of the systems and the software can't just push them out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10307.862s">[Ruseau]</a>: And these reports are not just another report to throw in the recycling bin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10311.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're reports to help us guide the district and understand where we want Medford Public Schools to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10317.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: And without that information,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10320.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, it's you're steering without a map and it's just not a good situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10326.449s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I appreciate that they're in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10328.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: I hope we can keep them in there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10329.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I also just hope we can get the 79 million and stop being all worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10334.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11047.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11047.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll just be quick because Darren actually said something really important about time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11055.319s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Jerry, have you already begun projections for next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11063.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: for FY26 on, you know, I mean, some of those things you can just stick them in a spreadsheet, find out here's what the teacher contract says, here's what the custodial contract says, here's how much it's going up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11075.01s">[Ruseau]</a>: Have you started that already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11086.582s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, for FY26, you can see into the future on some things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11091.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Open contracts, you can't necessarily, but you can make a guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11095.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: Am I correct that we will have a very similar nightmare next year if we do not dramatically increase revenue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11107.659s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11108.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's important for anybody who might be on the fence about an override, because if we<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11115.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: don't, then what we're doing right now is gonna seem like the good old days, because once we've, if we have to go through with these cuts next year, like, all those things are gone already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11128.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: What else is it we're cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11130.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, I said in the last meeting, arts, and I don't mean all of arts this year, obviously, so $1.75 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11139.608s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we are multiple millions of dollars short next year, we're not cutting math, we're not cutting science, we're not cutting English, and we're not cutting history.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11148.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can I get all of those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11150.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those aren't really, those are not options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11152.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not getting rid of elementary schools or middle schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11155.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when you look at what we will not be in trouble with with the state, if we cut, we all know what programs those are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11165.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's a lot of people here from those programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11168.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so we have this nightmare to get through right now, but the moment we finish and pass some budget, we are, it's like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11180.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rinse and repeat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11181.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we do not find dramatically more revenue for the city and the state is not going to come and save us at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11186.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: They are really aren't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11188.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think, you know, I certainly advocate with my, my state senator and state rep, and, you know, there's some improvement, but as I said in the last meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11199.161s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, there's no formula to fix Medford, because our property taxes and everybody wants to say their property taxes are too high because nobody likes taxes, but our property taxes are the seventh lowest in the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11217.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: You may not feel it, I may not feel it and I certainly don't look forward to paying more in taxes, but the facts are the facts, so the state will not fix this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11226.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we do want to have a public school system we'd be willing to send our kids to, we have to pay more in property taxes is the only actual option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11235.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11236.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we don't wanna say to the teachers, oh, you're gonna get 0% for the next three years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11241.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody's like, you get 2 1⁄2 every year, that's too much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11243.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then in the same breath, we're gonna give teachers 3% a year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11247.281s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm not saying they don't deserve it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11249.603s">[Ruseau]</a>: But second grade math says, you get 2 1⁄2% more, you're gonna give out 3% more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11254.866s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where's this supposed to come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11259.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: The answer is, it's supposed to come from increasing property taxes going up more than 2 1⁄2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11266.84s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not a school committee problem to solve, although we can scream about it till the end of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11272.002s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a city problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11274.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, Mayor and City Council problem and then the voters, and hopefully lots of you all will join in the drive to get people to vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11285.475s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next year we're going to have this conversation again, and we're not going to be cutting a coordinator or a non filled theater teacher, if we have to cut many millions of dollars next year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11297.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean I don't I don't want to say those words out loud, but we all know it is not math it's not science it's not English and it's not history it's arts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11310.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11311.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I hope we can get past just tonight and this budget and recognize this is your engagement has got to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11321.661s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because showing up once a year isn't gonna fix it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=11325.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18518.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18525.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: The motion was the member school committee budget request in the amount of $79,399,774 for the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18533.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: responsible operations of the member public schools in 2024 2025 be submitted in writing to the member city council and the mayor of Medford within 48 hours of this motion, it was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18546.117s">[Ruseau]</a>: I made the motion of a second if I remember all the party.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18598.932s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18616.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: Voting on the bottom involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18618.336s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18619.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18623.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18623.903s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18624.043s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18624.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18625.365s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18625.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18625.585s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18625.765s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=18626.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=98.334s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, and so that means my audio should be going over the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=104.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, and I'm unmuted and I'm switching over to that so you can see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=111.039s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we recording?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=111.879s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=112.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, good to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=526.61s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=527.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=527.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because they just seem like a group that- Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=544.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: My experience is that custodians actually run into a lot of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=547.903s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=554.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: custodians are in every room hall every day so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=871.028s">[Ruseau]</a>: Usually not, which makes the numbers, but also I'm thinking that like so we as a full committee would set out and put our stamp of approval on the capital improvement plan annually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=884.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's a bunch of input.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=886.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: Before we get to that meeting, we don't need to know about the paint fixes here and there and the water filter replacements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=894.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: And obviously, when Dr. Cushing goes through all of the training and reporting, he'll be able to give us a report that's a meaningful starting place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=905.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: As a committee would approve it and that the individual items, you know, we would send that over presumably to the city for a request for the funds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=913.871s">[Ruseau]</a>: They would give us a certain amount, but they would not get to decide the order of that list like we we've decided this is the order of what we're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=922.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the request that we're putting how much we want, and you give us as much as you can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=926.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we starting at the top of our list go down, but then each of those projects actually seems like would be things that would go into their buildings and grounds committee to monitor and check on progress and like, how is it happening?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=940.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's just my thought.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=961.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=962.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, that intersection, what our priorities are, that intersection is a very interesting one, because there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=970.737s">[Ruseau]</a>: there may be projects that are on our plan that the city in whole manages in every imaginable way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=980.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then projects that we are managing in whole and then projects where we're both managing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=985.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: So like what it looks like on their plan is an interesting question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=992.077s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, I mean, cause<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=993.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: do we want their plan to just have like a, you know, if it was a pie, like there's a pie slice and it just says schools, or do we want their pie to have our, you know, like our list may in fact be a hundred items long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1040.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1041.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's where taking it back is really the point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1177.748s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not recommissioned at the end of the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1221.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's great news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1222.334s">[Ruseau]</a>: I like that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1223.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: That makes a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1223.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also like you know the if we can do the recommissioning studies pretty much all at once then we don't end up with a scenario where one school is getting<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1237.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: Lots of lovely things, while there are things that are more serious at other schools that just haven't been put on the list yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1243.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1244.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, that having all those at once will allow us to prioritize from a district perspective.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1266.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: I never even heard these words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1291.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: Am I wrong to just, you know, just to check me on this, like that any OPM and anybody we hire to do this is gonna provide us a reasonably functioning, the reports not look terribly different from one to the next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1390.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because some of that stuff will not be stuff that can be waiting for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1491.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think this timing works well because we will actually sort of know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1496.825s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll finish the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1498.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: We will have an idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1500.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, pre-cash will have been certified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1502.866s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anything going into stabilization fund will have been completed by July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1507.347s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we will really be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1549.68s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you mind sitting over here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1552.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have a video right there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1554.945s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1676.748s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, because the McGlynn is two schools, is that limit in place if we really just do something like in one of the sides?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1690.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: But then the limit is not 300 for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1692.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'd be 150.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1693.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1789.299s">[Ruseau]</a>: Nope, it's been addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1874.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would have to look it up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1875.405s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a feedback thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1881.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Automatic dimming, I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=1957.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, but thank you for asking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2139.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it just changed last year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2214.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: We thought they were going to cost $80,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2216.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: What were they actually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2296.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: The one here is pretty cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2297.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's stuff that is never going to be gone until they demolish this building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2302.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that stuff still there too?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2306.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: Probably.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2329.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was the July 31st date?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2491.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't need your notes to write this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2493.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I couldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2495.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is where the audio is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2580.779s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2583.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, we do think you're nuts, but that's not really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2587.481s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2589.122s">[Ruseau]</a>: I certainly have enough information to actually draft a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2593.024s">[Ruseau]</a>: Based on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2594.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: Repeating it all for Jerry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2598.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2600.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we want to have another meeting here or should I just like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2616.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: School handbook policy, like that format feels like that would be good for this as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2622.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, date ranges, phases, who's responsible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2626.306s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, literally a sentence for each phase is sort of like, why are we doing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2634.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then bullets about the things that will have to happen, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2644.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll add that in there, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2646.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, because I think we, what we thought was, Terri, was that the buildings and ground would sort of like get the projects to, once they are in action, like once they're funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2657.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2658.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2659.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: Rather than here opening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2660.234s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2660.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2691.185s">[Ruseau]</a>: So one of the things we talked about earlier was they do the bidding too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2701.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, that's I like easy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2704.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not cheap, but I mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2714.725s">[Ruseau]</a>: So one of the things we talked about was we're going to have the school's capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2721.508s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the Collins Center document has just all, it's separated, but it's still, it's like this big mashed pile of capital for the whole community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2734.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: And one of the things I'm curious about, if you've seen in other places is like, so we have our capital plan and then the city has a capital plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2743.577s">[Ruseau]</a>: And do we like the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2746.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like the Memphis Public Schools budget will just be school department, a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2752.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that kind of what you think happens in other communities where in their capital plan, it says school department and a number, or do they have our plan sort of like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2762.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: blown out into theirs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2822.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the actual spending and all that, your office is essentially who deals with that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2826.97s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, cause I'm for the, I was going back to the definition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2832.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if it's actually capital, it's not in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2905.452s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm glad I don't have to do this stuff daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2949.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/B3irwyUDnjU&t=2953.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's only three of us, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=61.98s">[Ruseau]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=63.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeld.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=63.881s">[Ruseau]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=65.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Russo, present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=66.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Lungo-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=138.963s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=140.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=141.204s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=141.764s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Reinfeldt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=142.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=143.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rossell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=143.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=143.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7527.805s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could we get that presentation sent to us, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=7530.727s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you so much, wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8197.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8199.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: I brought my kids to the old playground when they were little and even did skate, not on skates, but it was definitely skating material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8207.756s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really, I did get to tour it and it is, while it is, when I toured it, it's far from done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8215.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is shocking that it's the same,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8219.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: footprint really that's sort of the thing that's hard to really wrap your head around is that the old one felt frankly small and this just feels so big it's like a like a TARDIS or something from Doctor Who it's like how on earth did you get all this in here doesn't feel crowded it's really amazing and I cannot say<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8243.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: enough good things about it, and I'm super excited for the stuff that's yet to come.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8247.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that there's a lot of stuff that looks<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8254.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: tar color, but that's going to be colorful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8256.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can't remember, I think it was Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8261.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pelequin who explained the way the color differentials will help those with low vision and just the thoughtfulness around things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8271.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because when you first glance at it, you're like, there's all these opportunities for kids to fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8274.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: But of course, we want kids to have the opportunity to fall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8278.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: The old playgrounds make them so safe that they are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8283.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: can't possibly skin a knee, but also they're boring is thankfully becoming a thing of the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8290.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cause like I drive through Belmont every day and they have a beautiful playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8297.218s">[Ruseau]</a>: It looks like architecturally like gorgeous, but it's all brown and it is all that style of nobody can get hurt in our playgrounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8308.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure it costs probably more than our playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8311.228s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I'm glad we're not going there and that it's going to be a place the kids can't get enough of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8316.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my kids are way too old to enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8318.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll just go by myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8320.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: But thank you so much for all the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8321.971s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really an enormous number of people involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8326.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I want to thank the mayor and and the residents for funding it through the CPC because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8333.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: It wasn't the cheapest thing we could have done is an understatement, but I think our kids are really going to benefit from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8341.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: And not just the kids at the McGlynn, like my kids didn't go to the McGlynn, but we went there anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8347.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that the kids of the entire city are gonna drive there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8350.857s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's parking, especially on a weekend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=8352.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9272.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9274.792s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have no questions other than, is there actually a bet whether we can be the fastest at this project in the history of the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9282.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I mean, we had documents done before we begun, which has to be unusual.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9290.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm excited by<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9294.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham's ability to keep the gas pedal accelerator, excuse me, pressed to the floor in a way that amazes me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9305.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I feel like nobody's getting run over, which is also kind of impressive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9308.432s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I wanted to thank you for that because every time I come to a meeting, I can't believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9313.137s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're done with that document already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9678.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's hope it's never that late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9680.407s">[Ruseau]</a>: The city council approves the municipal budget with the final allocation for member public met for public schools, one review and approval by the city council phase eight school committee of review and approval of final budget target date June one through June 30.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9750.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: five business days after the public hearing to approve the proposed reconciled budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9757.141s">[Ruseau]</a>: E, if a public hearing is not required, a regular or special school committee meeting will be scheduled to approve the proposed reconciled budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9765.287s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then four, the final budget will be posted to the Medford Public Schools website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9770.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a few definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9825.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9828.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can I just speak on it real quick first?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9830.993s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, most of this is actually stuff we already do, especially the budget preparation stuff and the planning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9839.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, those are sections that are for the administration, so obviously any changes, additions, subtractions that they would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9849.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: I obviously I think we would be happy to consider those changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9854.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: The dates are were difficult, because the city council passed the budget ordinance that says on March 1, that the mayor's office will tell the school district, or I don't know if it tells city council or the school district, what the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9871.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: potential allocation will be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9874.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we had to really, the dates on this really had to be planned around that date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9881.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, to pretend we don't get a number when we get a number doesn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9886.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's why a lot of this stuff is sort of backed up and that March 1 date is so important in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9893.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, one of the things in this current budget cycle that I think<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9899.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if everybody agrees, but I certainly think many people in the community would want to know is like when we had our presentation of the budget last<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9910.427s">[Ruseau]</a>: time or the time before, and we we cut 2.2 million and still had 2.7 million left to figure out how to cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9918.671s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I understand why we did that, because, like, it was probably very hard to even wrap our heads around where we would make those cuts, but it's June, and if we still had to make those cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9932.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: that's not a lot of time for the community to respond, for us to respond, for staff to be like, all right, we've just decided we're laying off another 50 people, they got families and mortgages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9944.139s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I felt it was really important that when we get an allocation, a projected allocation, that we take it completely seriously, and that we have a document that says, if that's our number, here is how we'll get there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9959.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: We still don't have that now and I understand why and I, I actually support that, because this gap was so phenomenally large, but in a normal year even if there's a gap, we need to be able to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9973.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is how we're going to do it now we aren't going to put names and say these people are getting laid off all the way back in February that would or March that would make no sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9982.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, how are we going to get from what we need to what we think we may get the public should know that we should know that, and not a few weeks before schools out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9995.296s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that was sort of my.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=9997.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: my point in all that and then also telling the city council I mean the city council has traditionally received our budget book that we get.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10006.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's, that's the, that's the recommended budget from the school committee that's not what will actually happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10015.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that if we have the budget request, which is that this is what we would like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10022.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we only get that projected allocation, this is what it will look like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10027.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: And a letter that says, here's how we did it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10030.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: And no we don't like it, but I think that they need that for their deliberations because I know the superintendent was in the hot seat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10038.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, it's too big of a.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10042.779s">[Ruseau]</a>: The budget is too big to just drill you for an hour or two even, and think that that's enough, that's that's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10052.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's just too much for the city council to actually take all that in, and to get to all their questions really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10062.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is this other thing in here of having the budget hearing, possibly up to three times, and that is to say, if we are really going to have to make cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10075.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: that are bigger than I just picked 1% because I looked at the math and thought that's, that's still a lot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10082.119s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have to cut 1% or more than the public should be able to have a say, just like with the regular budget hearing, which is why we have to have the budget hearing so that the public can say what they think about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10095.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that's the overview of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10099.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I apologize for it being so long and wordy, but I just felt like I couldn't, this is shorter than it was, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10228.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10230.798s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, you know, it is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10233.937s">[Ruseau]</a>: Phase one and phase two, frankly, are the superintendent's office, and they could have just been called phase one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10241.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, those dates, you know, between October one and February one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10246.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: Honestly, I don't, I don't think anybody cares where and how you have to switch that around so you know the December thing really bothered me when I was doing it because I'm like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10258.32s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like December 31st, well, like it's the holidays or winter break or whatever you call it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10264.282s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that that wasn't a lot of time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10267.923s">[Ruseau]</a>: So certainly if you wanna move the dates around or move things in phase one and two around, I think that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10277.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of this language I did get from Cambridge Public Schools, which frankly, they were the only school system I could find that had anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10287.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody had the same block paragraph that we all inherit from MASC, which essentially says, we'll do a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10295.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: Gee, thanks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10297.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, so definitely that stuff feels very much squishy and whatever you recommend for changes, I'm sure we would be fine with, or I would be fine with, I can't speak for the committee, but that's how those came about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10675.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10676.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, in my seven and a half years now, we've done budgets, this will be the third way that we've done them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10684.678s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I started, the way we did them, I mean, it was just the way I've been done, I was new, was that every department head, every principal came before the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10697.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: They told us what they wanted, but of course, we're not their boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10702.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: The superintendent's their boss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10703.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: So everything that they were presenting, the superintendent already had, of course, like vetted, or I assumed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10711.453s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it made no sense that we were being presented with something that the superintendent had already said, yeah, that's fine, as if we were going to somehow,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10722.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: be a decision maker at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10723.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was informational, but the biggest flaw in that was that, you know, if a department head had like a big spend, they wanted to really do something big with the department and the superintendent after talking down about how much money there was, was like, we can't do it this year, or we never hear about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10742.756s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we were hearing about those things that we weren't gonna get to do,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10749.042s">[Ruseau]</a>: because we didn't have the resources in those meetings, then that could have been useful and helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10754.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that was the first couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10758.63s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then remember Graham got on and that got turned upside down where it was, here's the list of things we would do if we had the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10769.459s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we did that, I think, two years and then we have this pandemic thing that happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10775.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, actually, no, I got my time right a little off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10778.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, we had a laundry list of things we would do if we could.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10782.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: And many of those things were not like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10785.157s">[Ruseau]</a>: know nice to have they were things you're like wait the public schools doesn't do that stuff like how are you operating a public school and not doing that which was sort of the whole point was to have that in black and white um and this year we haven't we sort of done it a different way because we just because we knew how big the the budget gap was so a lot of that stuff kind of fell to the ways to the side as<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10810.562s">[Ruseau]</a>: We could have done it, but honestly, what was the point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10814.804s">[Ruseau]</a>: It sort of felt like this year, like what was the point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10819.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I forgot what my point was in response to your question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10823.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was your question?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10838.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: That, sorry, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10839.922s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I guess part of the problem with that type of transparency is that the, I mean, it isn't really appropriate to think department heads and principals are gonna come and essentially just ignore what their boss said and say, here's what we think that the priorities for science should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10861.966s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the superintendent doesn't agree, I don't think we should hear about it because that's not transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10867.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: We hire and supervise the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10870.613s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if she believes that's not the way to do it right now, or we can't afford it, I think that's not transparent for us, but it's on the other side of a veil that is like etched in stone in the law.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10887.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we can,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10892.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: dig and we can, you know, throw the fishing hook in and try and pull that stuff out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10897.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we will hear from the community and other folks like, you know, science, which is doing great, by the way, but I'm using it as an example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10905.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: Science has a problem like we did before we bought FOSS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10909.821s">[Ruseau]</a>: And maybe we can push, but I just think having, it really felt like a dog and pony show where<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10918.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: department heads and the principals told us stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10922.652s">[Ruseau]</a>: And every year they seem to sort of have everything they needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10925.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it was like two months of committee of the halls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10930.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was like on top of school committee, two months of committee of the halls, where at the end you were just like, okay, I know what's going on, but there's no strategic anything involved because it's already been decided by the superintendent, which is appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10946.551s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dO3Co7kdQLU&t=10947.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: I understand that desire, but I also feel like getting that desire satisfied is in some ways outside of our jurisdiction, if you will, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4114.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the only other issue is we don't get to decide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4127.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4127.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: So he could bring in<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4143.627s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will say though, a few years ago, I was bringing in folks to $200,000 a year, which is what's kept us afloat in tough times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=4339.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: Don't you just remember everybody's name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5482.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: And on top of that, I feel like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5485.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can't remember if it was the Oklahoma school that we saw the video for, some of us saw, but we did go to, I've been to Arlington, I drive by the Watertown High School being built right now, and I drove by Winchester's when they were being built, and all of these schools seem to have something in common, that school is the walls,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5514.599s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there's no integration in nature at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5516.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no, I mean, we have probably more than most of those places because we have those corridors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5524.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just feel like, while intentional spaces for the classroom do seem important, I just feel like students should walk through the doors of a school building and then get completely encapsulated and start to walk out the doors, like nature grants<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5544.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: climate is getting hotter, but there's no integration with nature at all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5549.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no intention that the students are in and out of the building in any way in any of those schools that I described.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5558.313s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're very much in the clinical field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5562.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know if we have any good examples<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5571.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how that works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5597.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: share if I can say, are we going to build a place?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5965.69s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5966.29s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5967.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cultural stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5975.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what your conversation is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=5982.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, Peter, we're going to get cows here, you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6357.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for bringing that up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6360.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not sure where it's at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6369.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, Medford does lack a lot of community spaces, and we're not going to be able to supply enough for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6376.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, it's about, like, how we segregate portions of this building, many different segments of it, even at a time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6386.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because, like, those girls down here, if we find a place to put our troops, we can't do it at home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dFRUMZnF2Cc&t=6404.5s">[Ruseau]</a>: turn this into, you know, that open campus idea, I don't really know much about it because it's a lot, but the idea of the school community sector or education, community education, for all of these, there's so many more things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2675.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yes, member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=2676.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, Marilyn goker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=3221.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5593.447s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5595.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: Around the invitations to parents, caregivers, I suppose there's no way to confirm receipt, of course, and spam filters and all the other things that get in the way of our actually getting to an email.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5611.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: Assuming that we're not inviting 1,000 people, can we include in the process to investigate<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5620.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: any affirmative declines to understand why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5624.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because I think that's something that, you know, understanding why we've offered a service, you acknowledge that we've offered the service, and then you say, no, I think it would be helpful to understand why so that we can perhaps in a future year, it'll always just be useful information in general, because we don't have a lot of opportunities for that kind of information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5646.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: but really understanding why people would decline it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5649.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cause I'm sure that's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5650.918s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, maybe they're away on vacation that week or.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5654.244s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there are plenty of reasons for which we can do nothing about and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5658.928s">[Ruseau]</a>: But are there reasons like transportation or they have to watch a sibling during the day?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5667.474s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are the kinds of things I think that could be useful information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5670.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as we think about students that have been identified as needing services, making sure they can get them is super important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/J62hOL_nVQ8&t=5678.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1677.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1677.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I want to feed everything from this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1682.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I think about the community involvement, several people have mentioned that we are somewhat limited by our own experiences and knowledge, well, we are completely limited by our own experiences and knowledge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1699.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1700.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unlike the community, we're going to go around and look at lots of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1705.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: The whole of Medford is not like this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1708.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so I think it's, well, to be expected, reasonable to think we have an outsized impact on what's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1719.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I mean, obviously, I'm not serving the community, and I look forward to the professionals that kind of do that, doing that, because, like, I don't envision them<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1729.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: providing us with a list of things to do with this building, this room, like, they're going to be providing, in my mind, a set of values, what's important to them, and have feedback from there to create a vision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1746.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: But to ask the community, will be self-selected, it will absolutely be not representative of the community, that's 100% not an option, to somehow<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1758.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: generate a vision, I think it will be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1764.214s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just don't see that as something to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1767.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's sort of, in my mind, I mean, I'm on this committee, because I have a search for new things that I need to make sure we don't stop talking about, stop thinking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1778.584s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I assume everybody here was on here for people had to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1791.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: but they're not investing in five to seven years of their lives getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1798.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I really do care very much about what everyone else is saying, but like me, I went to a one-level school in Borough of New Hampshire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1807.846s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was a regional school and built in 1970 or so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1812.268s">[Ruseau]</a>: And to me, that's what high school is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1815.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: I sure hope we don't do that here, but until we start this,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1821.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know what you're going to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1823.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1825.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to that opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1827.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then sharing what we're experiencing with those tours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1832.441s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like, we saw this thing, like, far like a van, these tunnels that are like as big as this, from the ceiling to the first floor, going through the library, provide light, natural light, everywhere the library came.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1848.293s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's kind of weird, to be honest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1849.861s">[Ruseau]</a>: But also, like, never seen such a thing and thought it was cool to go there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1855.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I'm excited for all of these visits, because I suspect we're going to find in every visit things that we want more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1864.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we're like, let's not do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=1867.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4145.143s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can tell you right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4147.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's one word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4148.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4149.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: Luke?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/zIDY2XMKUO4&t=4149.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since COVID, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3095.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: Remember yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3097.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3099.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3100.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I don't really know much about city year other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3109.648s">[Ruseau]</a>: recipient of services or however you would describe that, I think that's awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3114.372s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm curious, I did read the entire memo and I'm wondering what the stipend is for 45 hours of labor per week.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3125.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll ask my questions and then I can go back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3128.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: Somebody has answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3130.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll just get them all out once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3133.69s">[Ruseau]</a>: How do we ensure that they're not doing any work that is currently covered by any of our CBAs with our union partners?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3141.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: We can't take union work and give it to non-union members, and I'm concerned about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3151.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: wonder what of the $100,000 is used, what percentage of that is used to pay the employees, which I don't, I don't know if they're considered employees since the word stipend is a very specific legal thing used, which I typically dislike that word stipend when people are gonna be working full time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3170.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then I'm,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3175.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I've read a couple of articles, it seems to suggest that City Year folks spend a significant amount of time talking about City Year while they're in the schools, drumming up support for future City Year participants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3186.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I guess I would ask Member Olopade, how did you hear about City Year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3189.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: If I could ask through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3723.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3725.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are these fellows considered employees or, and therefore getting, you know, Social Security benefits and all that stuff contributed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3752.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you, so they would be paying both sides of Social Security, Medicare out of the 27,300.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3760.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that, you know, when we think about most minimum wage workers, they are also getting the employers paying for all of that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3773.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, you do pay the employer's share?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3777.219s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, so they're, okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3779.2s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was a little confused on that, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3781.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as for what they would do in the school, and I realize these are early days in this conversation, but I've heard people say they could be substitutes, they could help when their paras are out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3794.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: And those are, well, I don't actually think substitutes are part of any of our CBA, any of our contracts, but I am deeply concerned that we're going to have them fill in for work because we can't find employees to fill jobs<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3811.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: that we have posted in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3813.704s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, that's just not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3819.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: You can't just have non-union workers taking over union work, regardless of why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3826.152s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, and I don't think that's, that's certainly not a question for you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3829.134s">[Ruseau]</a>: Roberts, because that's a superintendent issue and perhaps a school committee discussion as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3840.579s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so $100,000, a team of six at $27,300, I mean, that's not even covering the cost.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3854.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where does the rest of the money come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3871.101s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5021.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa was first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5117.021s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5117.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I appreciate member and tapas point about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5121.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: Adding anything an additional new expense at a time when we're.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5126.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: About to have a discussion about our budget and the layoffs that are involved in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5130.473s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think that's an exceptionally good point and a little embarrassed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5134.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't get to that one already, but, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5138.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, um.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5140.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: I feel like there's significant critical questions we need answers to aside from the funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5149.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think knowing that our union partners are okay with this is not unimportant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5158.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the deployment, I feel like a plan should, even a,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5164.893s">[Ruseau]</a>: generic, you know, wireframe plan of what this would look like without, obviously, you won't have the information about which teachers raise their hands.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5175.276s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, you're not going to have that happen until after we're already like, yes, we're going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5181.118s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, after school, that sounds fine, except that they can't be the after school people that are<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5192.458s">[Ruseau]</a>: replacing the other adults we would want to have and expanding afterschool for one year so that next year we are going to be in crisis mode because we are going to have fewer people to staff it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5206.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's one thing to be on a wait list and to be like, I wish I could have gotten afterschool care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5212.313s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then it's another thing to get it and then<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5215.829s">[Ruseau]</a>: 12 months later, be told you had a spot, you don't have a spot anymore because we just can't recruit enough people to fill those spots.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5224.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that concerns me about any times we talk about expanding after school is that I feel like after school, the staff spends an enormous amount of time trying to find staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5236.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5238.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: that's just a permanent problem of afterschool programs everywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5242.334s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the idea of having more space is delightful, I think, especially if you have a kid and you need it, but I don't know that we want to make a bed of crisis that we're gonna have to all lay in a year from now or a year after when the city year has not continued.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5264.148s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5267.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do just have some, you know, those are my big concerns and I feel like I would rather have answers before we approve continuing with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5275.237s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we could get those answers at another meeting, I think that would be a better time to motion to approve this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=5284.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, I'd like to motion to table it to our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6270.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I didn't get a second, thankfully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6273.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, the housing point is one that's quite moving, frankly, for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6279.011s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, this is not gonna be money that's going to be in our budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6286.354s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, because our budget is being presented tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6288.614s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, there's an assumption that we're gonna find the money in these revolving accounts, which we have all of the totals in the actual budget presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6297.197s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although those are the end of last fiscal year totals, not the current totals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6303.019s">[Ruseau]</a>: If Mr. McHugh believes he can find the money and if he can't find the money, if the city can perhaps provide the money out of the quote free cash, you know, that's all, you know, somebody has to write the check and it's not the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6318.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're not cutting anybody else to do this and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6324.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, as member Brantley pointed out, I mean, it's like, this doesn't look good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6329.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: I remember in top, I believe, I'm sorry, I forget who said it, but, you know, my concerns about union work remain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6340.311s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not particularly pleased with the amount of money that these folks will get paid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6345.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe they'll be the lowest paid workers in the district and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6352.186s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I also can't ignore the needs in the afterschool program, which is only a portion of the day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6358.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we've talked about that extensively, but there's the rest of the day, they have to be doing something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6365.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that if we can have answers to that at a meeting in July, I would be moved to the point where I could agree to approve this, just because I do think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6380.359s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you know tonight, then folks can perhaps get into the July one hunt for a place to live rather than the August one, which is the exact same time when all of the college students in Medford are, the Tufts are all looking for housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6396.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: So my concerns remain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6400.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would like us to have a meeting to discuss them, but I would be moved to a yes vote on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=6889.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7035.37s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7036.191s">[Ruseau]</a>: As I understand this statute, this will simply mean that you all can start having conversations about doing this work, that absolutely no sharing of resources occurs when we agree to this, that if we want to share any resources, those individual decisions will come to the school committee and the city council, and we will vote whether we agree or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7057.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7085.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7086.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you're suggesting that this paper allows the superintendent and the city to get together and decide that maintenance will now be a city function, that utilities won't be charged to the schools anymore, we'll just have them charged out of the schools, that we'll move any of the functionalities, information systems, IT department, those that you and who else gets to decide that that is now just a city function?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7131.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: So facilities being the obvious one, and you've mentioned it, and I think everybody assumes that that's what we were talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7138.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we approve this, that means the school committee no longer has oversight of facilities, as is the case in Somerville.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7146.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: During the pandemic, the school committee lived through hell because they did not open, the city did not open the schools because the schools were 100%, facilities-wise, were a part of the city of Somerville, and that is still the case today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7162.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have any maintenance challenges, the rational thing for the community to do is to bring up the school committee, at which point we will say, sorry, not our job, call City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7177.234s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just want that to be clear that that's the situation we'll be in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7181.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if we are unsatisfied with<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7184.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: how the city is doing the maintenance in our buildings, which I have no reason to believe that's the case, that would happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7189.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if that happens, our only option would be to sever, to end this entirely, abruptly, just decide that no longer the city has any responsibility for facilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7202.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that how you understand this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7261.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7261.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my last question is, so this person will not report to the superintendent or has supervision within the school system, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7270.018s">[Ruseau]</a>: If our director of facilities was reporting to the director of DPW or whoever it would be, director of facilities at the city, that person would be doing their review, the contractor would be a mayor, signs the contract, not the school committee or the superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7472.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll let me tell you what I wrote down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7476.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve 2024-30 and require school committee approval for any plan before sharing resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8664.19s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm going to just quickly go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8666.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I had a lot of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8667.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm trying to keep them brief.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8669.832s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to comment that in the message from the superintendent on the third paragraph, it does say that we've fully funding programs and positions formally funded with our ETRA grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8679.675s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I believe there are still a couple that we did not continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8682.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8694.694s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8695.154s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to be sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8696.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8698.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: And thankfully I put tabs, which this is a lot easier in person to do this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8707.791s">[Ruseau]</a>: I wanted to comment on page seven under federal grants.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8712.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: I see this sentence in here, which made me very happy and I just wanted to thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8716.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says, when these grants are received during the course of the fiscal year, the actual grant amount received will be presented to the school committee for acceptance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8723.884s">[Ruseau]</a>: I am very thankful for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8725.745s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have not done that in the past and it doesn't change anything financially, but it does keep us more informed about what's coming in, where it's going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8738.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8742.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's that, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8743.214s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't mean to shush you on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8745.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: I came across wrong.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8746.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8748.095s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page nine, the Bedford Family Network, there's a negative balance of $70,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8751.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8751.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: Quite surprising and wondering<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8758.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where does the money come from that goes in there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8761.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: And how are we operating the Family Network?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8820.866s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8822.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: On page 11, under the funding summary, the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8828.621s">[Ruseau]</a>: Last sentence of the first paragraph says with this in mind, the superintendent submitted a budget recommendation of 76.6 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8836.207s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then it says increasing the base budget by 8.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8840.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that is the 8.2 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8846.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know where you get that from 71.2 to go up to 76 and get 8.2.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8848.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, the 76 included the $2.2 million savings plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8858.12s">[Ruseau]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8858.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8859.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: That makes sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8865.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8867.464s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm a little confused by, so we have on page 12 that we had five elementary teachers that were included to be cut in this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8880.339s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I go across the actual schools, I come up with, and then it says that we restored three, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8895.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that should leave three elementary still cut.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8897.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when I go through the rest of the document, I show seven cuts to elementary teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8906.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I can tell you exactly where they are, and you can tell me if maybe I'm misunderstanding them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8917.172s">[Ruseau]</a>: On the McGlynn Elementary classroom teachers, I see two teachers are cut, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8955.72s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, well, then that form on it seven minus four is three so minus four three yes i'm I feel like that makes sense now, thank you, I do what I really appreciate this listing of positions and then the little.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8968.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like know at the bottom about like minus to reduce by to tease or whatever I think that really.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8975.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: was very helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8977.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although this issue of adding things after the budget is approved is always the wonkiest part because like for all, you know, I went through the Medford Public Schools budgets going back into the 80s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8990.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: This year, last year, this year, earlier this year I went to the library and there were a couple missing but almost all of them were there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8997.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=8999.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, being on the school committee, I know that this is the plan how we're going to spend money and has, in many regards, is not a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9009.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, at the highest level, it's a reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9013.309s">[Ruseau]</a>: But, you know, all the positions we have in there, and we couldn't find somebody or we didn't actually have the money, like, it doesn't tell the story that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9022.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: most people rationally would think it tells.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9025.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, last year we added kindergarten teachers after the budget was set, because we do that often when kids just show up and register.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9036.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm just wondering if you have recommendations, not for today, but for, you know, whether there's a policy recommendation you could have, where there's some kind of a<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9048.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: a document or something that we can create that will help the future school committees and maybe the community if they're so interested to really know, okay, this was the plan, this is what happened, was short of my memory and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9063.914s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, the people in the room, it just disappears into history as this unwritten thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9069.696s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really a problem because sometimes I, you know, many of us have had arguments on online about like, well, that's not what really happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9077.739s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, they're looking at the document we published that says, this is what's going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9081.48s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we might know that didn't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9083.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: But how do we communicate that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9085.722s">[Ruseau]</a>: And yeah,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9161.653s">[Ruseau]</a>: Got it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9162.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9166.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: Of the 18 positions that are still cut, assuming that number is right, and if it's not exact, were all of those positions actually positions with people in them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9220.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: But most of them did have people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9257.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can probably figure it out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9258.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's only been so many hours in the budget, but some of them would have blanks in there, which I think implied that they were open, like there was not somebody in them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9270.742s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not going to ask for a report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9272.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: I asked for too many hesitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9274.475s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do want to, and I don't know if this is just something for the payroll folks or HR to fix, but on this, under district-wide instruction and assessment, we have coordinator of world language, coordinator of art, and coordinator of music.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9290.912s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we settled their contract, they are no longer called coordinators, they're called directors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9297.455s">[Ruseau]</a>: obviously their pay is correct and all that other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9299.676s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I think that for a newbie reading this, you'd be like, oh, coordinator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9303.698s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I thought there was a director and just to synchronize those things where appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9310.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are the only three that I found where the title change would actually be necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9314.883s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that one of them were not funding anyways, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9318.965s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, so,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9328.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know there was a very long, not long, it wasn't terribly long, there was a memo explaining the kindergarten teacher situation and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9340.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a lot to that conversation, but I just want to repeat something I think is what I'm understanding is, you know, when we have to do layoffs, we have to do them in a certain order according to the contract in that at the Missittook, because the staff was newer, they were the folks who we had to lay off, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9372.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, I'm not necessarily all of them, I'm not suggesting, I mean, the non-professional status staff are by default.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9466.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9468.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's just the point is it's really quite complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9491.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I'll let some other people speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9494.946s">[Ruseau]</a>: I have a motion to make, but I'll wait on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9496.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9715.626s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9716.606s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9719.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to motion that Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay addition of K teachers to lower class<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9737.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: in order to lower class size, increase after-school capacity, and to fund recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9747.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the substitute pay, that's the end quote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9752.584s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that in some communities, or maybe even many or most communities, substitute pay is actually part of a contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9758.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: In Medford, it isn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9761.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that that is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9765.506s">[Ruseau]</a>: both good and bad, if it was in a contract, maybe it would be higher already, but because it's not, we can actually be, if we can secure more funding and we can target it that way, we can increase our substitute pay to whatever we want, well, assuming we can find the money, to really solve what is a crisis, I think, in some places where there's just no substitutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9790.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, whether it's a pay problem or not,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9795.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, the way our lives are created and oriented nowadays and the cost to live in Medford and all the other things makes it hard to find people for sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9804.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: But when there are some number of people doing this work and they have choices, Medford at one rate and then one town over, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9814.353s">[Ruseau]</a>: 100 yards away for dramatically more money, it's kind of hard for anybody to rationally choose the worst pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9822.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9824.102s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm happy to repeat it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9830.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9831.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham will work with the City Financial Task Force on behalf of the School Committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9847.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9856.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm gonna drop it in the chat so any member that wants to, likes to read can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9861.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: Once I figure out how to do this for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=9997.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just suggesting that might be the language you could use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10013.775s">[Ruseau]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10014.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay, addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, increase funds available to additional funds<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10038.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: to increase stipend pay in negotiations with our union partners, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=10056.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: How many things can I do at once?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11309.182s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, only that you must need a drink of water now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11314.557s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was looking for any kinds of typos and stuff like we had in the last one and I think we made it through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11320.961s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, so this was the work of the strategic planning subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11324.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: We kind of outlined the important dates and I was tasked with taking those four or five little notes and turning them into a policy and they are lining up with the city's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11336.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: budget ordinance, which is that March 1D isn't actually listed there, but that's why some things have to be done by the 28th of February, but also lines up with our budget policy we just approved a week or two ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11349.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm happy to answer any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11376.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, those lists really are to prioritize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11381.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, in my mind, each of those lists should be individually prioritized, which is actually the next step.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11387.781s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then if we're asking for funding from the CPC, then even if it's something that could be covered under net school spending, it would be in both lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11400.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: items will be could be in multiple lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11402.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay yeah I wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11403.49s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah so these items not eligible for Community Preservation Act or net school spending would be any major physical upgrade or something that's more than $150,000 that CPC doesn't cover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11419.097s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that these lists is also a way to communicate to the well aside from to the council but to the community it's like here's the real list<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11428.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: of projects that we can't do, which is whether it's because we don't have the capacity financially or infrastructure of staffing or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11462.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11463.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're going to send it and we're going to, it'll be added, I think it goes to the city clerk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11468.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the council wants to pretend we didn't send it, they can do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11473.436s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously they can't just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11476.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: write a check either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11477.487s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's for their budget process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11521.658s">[Ruseau]</a>: Number one,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11587.95s">[Ruseau]</a>: We actually have to do it the other way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11589.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have to approve the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=224.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: Capital Purchases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=229.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just was looking for a report on, I'm assuming this is for the Brooks boiler hot water heater.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=340.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we could just delay the vote on the capital purchases until we get to that item in the agenda, if that's okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=347.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to table, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1940.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm sure you know what I'm going to ask, that we get the field trip form.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1946.556s">[Ruseau]</a>: and all that Corey details at a subsequent meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1949.938s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is happening before our next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1960.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just I'm not suggesting we don't let them go, but we do a policy requiring that form to be approved before the field trip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1968.85s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'll pretend that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1971.169s">[Ruseau]</a>: about the policy for a minute, I guess, but just, you know, let's not put these forward without including all the proper paperwork.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1979.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we don't have that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=1988.766s">[Ruseau]</a>: we haven't had time to approve it because this is our first meeting and the field trip is next week how does that work policy-wise just curious i just honestly don't know remember um so i mean if the field trip was planned before the end of the school year for the beginning of the school year then it could be submitted then i would say that we should have a special meeting with a one-item agenda we can be in and out in 10 minutes but we we do have that policy because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2014.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I don't want to rehash history, but that's why we do require that we approve the form with, you know, the nursing looked at it and the nursing has signed off on it and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2025.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm sure that will all happen, but we are also supposed to give the sign off on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2031.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's how I would.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2033.165s">[Ruseau]</a>: Now, of course, you know, this could have come up literally a week ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2039.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: so i think you know we don't exercise special meetings that often we just save them for like emergencies but i think we should use them more often um for things such as this so we can comply with our own policies there's a motion for approval by member reinfeld seconded by member brandley all those in favor all right all those opposed motion passes enjoy um the field trip to our 23 students<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2556.624s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2557.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Were you fully staffed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2565.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's a problem not many people probably have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2567.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2569.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when we survey whether people are going to participate, do we ask them why if they say no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2586.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just sounds like something that might be interesting just to make sure there's not something that you could do differently that would increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2916.079s">[Ruseau]</a>: The number's growing so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2918.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: Can you talk about why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.254s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2951.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Title III pays for all of this, you said?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2955.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: Fabulous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2956.058s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3683.385s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3684.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: I noticed the comment in the teacher feedback that four days was fun, but the two weeks we did before was great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3692.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: What is this two weeks we did before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3754.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3755.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so Desi's paying for the meals and the time in the school and all that stuff, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3763.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: And they're not covering transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3767.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that, you know...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3770.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: that doesn't mean that we couldn't, I mean, you know, we don't have lots of money laying around, but that doesn't mean we couldn't do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3777.771s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when the invitations go out, I'm assuming there's lots of people who do not accept the invitation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3786.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we asking them why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3787.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is that useful information for planning in the future?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3850.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you're saying Gessie didn't even come out with the grant early enough?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3857.86s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3871.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4669.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to thank all of the staff and teachers that have spent their whole summer doing all this stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4676.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of this stuff happened in places that weren't the coolest facilities either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4679.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's one thing to spend your summer working with kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4686.007s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's another to do it when it's too damn hot in the buildings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4689.769s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thank you to all of the, too many people to list, but thank you to all of this wonderful staff and the administration for making it happen too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4899.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could you just send line CC to the school committee when the October 1 report goes to DESE?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4907.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's not gonna look terribly different, but it's good to have, you know, I keep these reports, but I also know that there are so many of these reports that they're not the important reports, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5141.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm putting it on my list for the budget season because options are the ever nightmarish redistricting, which is not a permanent solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5153.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's sort of like in my mind, it's like a 10 year solution because people who think that they need to go to a specific school will simply buy a house in that district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5162.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: It will be a painful experience for people who bought a house near a specific school<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5169.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: knowing that that's where their kid was gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5171.284s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then they go to register and they find out that's not where their kid's gonna go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5175.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, every district that has ever redistricted, it's not a good experience for the process, but it's necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5188.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: In my time on the school committee, we have moved programs all over the city because for one reason only,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5196.001s">[Ruseau]</a>: the Roberts was too full or the Brooks was too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5199.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were never doing it because it was right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5202.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was always, we were just too full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5205.708s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so, you know, some kids ended up on buses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5209.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: The newcomers program has been all over the place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5214.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: making decisions that are right for the kids should be how we're approaching these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5218.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that does also mean we're going to have to all experience some pain in redistricting if that's what we decide to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5226.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm adding it to my list, my short list of things for us to consider budgeting for in the upcoming year, because it isn't like we just get a map out and just start drawing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5237.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: You hire a company, a consultant who is specialized.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5241.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are consultants that specialize in exactly this thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5244.591s">[Ruseau]</a>: and they figure out things like what happens to busing and like you draw the line here and all there's these three new babies that were born this week on that street.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5252.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like they do all that hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5256.256s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think we're long past the need to do that because we have to do what's right for kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5264.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the Roberts is literally, I mean, the scenario of like a bunch of new people just move in,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5274.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: to that district that we're in bad, bad situation in that case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5281.835s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because if we decide those new kids have to go to another school, well, they might live right beside the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5289.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: And meanwhile, people who are really far from the Roberts, right at the edge, they're getting bused to the Roberts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5297.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not tenable to just avoid this very challenging and politically very unfun experience, because as you said, we're maxed out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5308.205s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there are other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5309.926s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, not that I don't think the principals all do great jobs, but we have principals making about the same amount of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5316.93s">[Ruseau]</a>: One has 177 more students to manage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5321.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: and I don't think they should get paid differently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5323.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we should resolve that problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5325.54s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, well, I guess we'll be talking about that more soon because we can't keep going.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5332.404s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5463.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=5465.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe that there's some members of the public who want to speak on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6267.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6270.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6271.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate that you tried to get answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6272.992s">[Ruseau]</a>: It doesn't sound like B2Q actually wants to give an answer to the question I asked about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6278.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: After 15 years, my question was pretty straightforward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6282.175s">[Ruseau]</a>: Is there any reason to believe that when this equipment must be replaced, that the electric replacement equipment in 10 to 15 years will be any cheaper than it is today?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6292.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's going to be a day when we're not going to be able to replace this stuff with...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6298.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: with fossil fuel based equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6302.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when I look at expenses like the electrical upgrade, the infrastructure upgrade that's gonna be required if we chose the electrical option, well, that number will get bigger and bigger every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6312.935s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, that's a lot of labor and big equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6317.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: So every year that number will continue to go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6319.977s">[Ruseau]</a>: So in 15 years, I don't know, double, triple, whatever it will be today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6324.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: um on top of inflation so um i mean my estimate you know is that we are looking at just being fine with an additional 185 000 pounds of carbon emissions by choosing the gas option over the electric option<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6346.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really wanted them to do an analysis, like just pretend electric rates don't change between now and 15 years from now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6353.188s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pretend the gas rates don't change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6355.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we can't know those two things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6358.571s">[Ruseau]</a>: But what would it cost to operate these two pieces of equipment over 15 years?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6363.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that was too hard for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6365.535s">[Ruseau]</a>: Based on the response, it sounds like they didn't want to be bothered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6368.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because this sentence here, frankly, is really obnoxious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6373.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6376.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: uh sorry where's that sentence essentially they're saying all that we should care about is cost that that's what they're saying they're assuming that the only thing this committee this community and humanity should care about is how much it costs and if that's the case we should all get some coal going because coal is probably cheaper than everything else um so i i don't<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6400.709s">[Ruseau]</a>: find their answer particularly satisfying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6403.151s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I hope that in the future we can decide that we're not going to accept their answer until they actually give us an answer that answers our questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6413.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not inappropriate for this committee to want to know this information as we are about to take a vote to pollute an additional 185,000 pounds of carbon into this atmosphere for one boiler at one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6428.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just think it's,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6431.277s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's absurd that they don't see this as anything other than a cost analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6440.321s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know how else to be more ticked off about it than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6445.044s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll let my colleagues ask their questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6538.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: What was the subcommittee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6574.55s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6577.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: This just dawned on me when somebody mentioned, I think you mentioned kitchen and electrification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6583.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6584.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6585.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we did buy stuff that we have to send back because our electrical infrastructure can't handle it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6592.05s">[Ruseau]</a>: So you know, we when we decide we want to replace the Brooks's kitchen equipment with induction everything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6602.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: we will be paying this expense then because we won't be able to do it then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6607.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's kind of like every project that is around electrification, we will either decide that we're just gonna, well, I guess we can't do it, it's too expensive, but it's like the same big expense in the middle of all of those decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6621.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And which year we decide, which budget do we decide, when does the city ever really have enough money to do that stuff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6629.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6630.728s">[Ruseau]</a>: Those are big questions, but we're never going to get to our goals around carbon emissions if we just, every time we have the decision, we're like, well, we can't afford it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6642.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're never going to afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6784.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor, we do need to approve the...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=6788.308s">[Ruseau]</a>: capital planning, that the capital purchase, I'll make the motion to approve it because they need a boiler.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.332s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7885.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7889.133s">[Ruseau]</a>: know i'm just reading an article um from this last year about worcester and their um they they got no bids so they decided to purchase at least 13 buses and that's sort of the trial of bringing busing inside i think that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7910.233s">[Ruseau]</a>: The elephant in the room here is that we want workers to work for $20 or $25 an hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7915.196s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for every parent that has ridden on a school bus for a field trip, you know that is utterly insane because you couldn't pay me enough money to ride on a school bus every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7925.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: No way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7928.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we want to solve the problem, and I don't think solving the problem is expecting Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies to find these magical people to work for, frankly, not very much money for terrible hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7944.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, they're not 40 hour a week jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7948.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, a solution that I'm going to ask you, if you know of districts that have brought all transportation inside, do they really run into these problems or do they have to pay their workers living wages with a pension and healthcare?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7961.414s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I don't know whether the bus companies do all that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7965.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I do know that they don't pay them enough, but do districts that have brought this stuff all in house and have a union and all that other stuff, do they have these problems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7993.442s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=7994.103s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, it's just, I don't know either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8047.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I certainly don't think we can do that for this upcoming contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8050.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: That would be impossible, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8054.509s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know that it's a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8056.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, you know, the efforts that Eastern Bus and all the other bus companies are going through to find people to work in these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8064.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I heard, I don't even know who I had the conversation with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8067.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think it was you, but like during the pandemic, all these workers went to work for Uber and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8075.643s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not interested in coming back to a job paying less that is, you know, I won't say worse because, I mean, obviously lots of people who drive buses probably enjoy it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8088.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would not be one of them, but they all went someplace where they got paid even more with a lot more flexibility and all the other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8097.642s">[Ruseau]</a>: So thinking we're going to get them back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8101.673s">[Ruseau]</a>: if we keep paying them the same.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8103.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the same conversation we have with afterschool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8105.575s">[Ruseau]</a>: We really wanna solve the afterschool, and it's 50, it's 60, it's $70 an hour, and you can raise your eyebrows, but do you wanna solve the problem or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8113.9s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we're not making new people, so we gotta get people to quit existing jobs to take these jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8121.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really basic, simple math, it's capitalism.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8126.067s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if we want to solve these kinds of problems,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8129.209s">[Ruseau]</a>: they can be solved, but they are not gonna be cheap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8131.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: The taxpayers have to decide, do we wanna solve the problem or we just wanna complain about the problem because the two cannot, or just complain about how much it costs because you can't have both.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=8145.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, you can, but you don't get a solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9293.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to, you know, the bathroom work is great, but we have all been to many bathrooms outside of schools and somehow the uric acid is not what you smell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9304.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I would like to hope that there's regular maintenance that can keep it from being where the grout has absorbed all the way to the board, the blue board in the back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9316.957s">[Ruseau]</a>: because that's not actually what happens in most bathrooms in most places you go to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9322.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've been to bathrooms in other schools like at Shore and they don't have to tap people in to do that kind of work because it's cleaned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9335.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: daily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9356.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: Wonderful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9487.291s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just, Bailey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9491.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: Apparently, this was news to me because I don't follow this level of detail with food, but the USDA has regulations on the number of calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9501.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have a friend who has a son at the high school who's like, you know, a man, an athlete.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9510.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9511.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: the same number of calories have to be given to that person to somebody like me or somebody who doesn't need many calories.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9519.326s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's really kind of bonkers that like 850 calories, it doesn't matter what on earth you as a human being need is the way it has to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9529.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, I just...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9530.974s">[Ruseau]</a>: just found this out i found it rather unfortunate but that's those are the usda rules i guess and um i think it's crazy frankly i mean some of these you know i was not an athlete as you probably could have figured out but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9545.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: if I was like 850 calories is a snack for some of these kids and that's supposed to be their lunch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9553.595s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just think it's really unfortunate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=9555.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanted to mention it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10067.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10068.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to warn everybody that the rest of the Title IX policies which we'll be receiving in the coming weeks make this look like a paragraph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10077.765s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of them are like dozens of pages long, unfortunately.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10082.59s">[Ruseau]</a>: So maybe we'll want to think about how we get through that in a meeting because we do have to at least read it once.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10087.714s">[Ruseau]</a>: But anyways, for this one, this is one of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10091.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: many policies that we have to, this is when we're updating for Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10097.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: All of our other Title IX policies don't exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10100.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's put the past in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10103.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: They should have existed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10104.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so I don't, I think the policy speaks for itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10108.569s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there is a number of cross-references.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10112.211s">[Ruseau]</a>: Almost all of those don't exist in our policy manual right now, but those are the ones that are coming before you in the coming weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10119.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10180.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: All those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10185.726s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did you ask if it was at all those in favor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10188.789s">[Ruseau]</a>: We didn't take a vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10191.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10194.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: We did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10195.396s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't write it down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10196.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10216.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: yes um we this is a relatively new thing for this committee the consent agenda i believe we just created that last year and i believe these are additional two types of approvals or things that we just approve so um i think it was the last meeting our meetings in june where we're like oh shouldn't this just be in consent agenda and i think everybody sort of thought it should so that's why i'm suggesting we amend this is there a motion on the floor<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=10270.806s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of the amendment to BEDB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8056.596s">[Ruseau]</a>: I want to thank you for bringing forward budget transfers to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8060.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8061.279s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I wish we could figure out where the extra echo is coming from, but thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8067.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'll second that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8078.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brantley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8080.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8305.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we already motion to approve the Cummings grant or did we already approve that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8441.797s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Soyes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=8442.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Longo-Kern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9382.06s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dr. Cushing, before you step away, though, are there schools where there's no charge?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9745.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, I would recommend that whatever community standards are developed that first of all, they're written down and then they're passed by our attorney because, um, students do have a first amendment rights, although it's slightly different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9758.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, and it can't just be a matter of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9761.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: You don't like it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9762.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: The principal doesn't like it because that does a pass muster with we are the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9768.783s">[Ruseau]</a>: the teachers of the government, we are all the government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9771.665s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that is, most people are confused on what the first amendment means, but the government interfering with what can and can't be said well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9782.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: having varied rules about what can be said based on what the content is is not allowed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9789.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, somebody wants to do a rainbow flag here, that's probably fine, but then you go to certain places in this country and the same rainbow flag might get you, you know, expelled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9802.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's an example of the need to be very careful here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9810.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: some things are offensive to some people and they're not to others.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9813.882s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it is not going to be up to the school to decide what's offensive and what's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9818.623s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a danger here I think that is deeply concerning for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9826.301s">[Ruseau]</a>: and uh i don't know that we have thought that part out it can't just be that the principal doesn't like it or you take a vote of administrators that those those are not options so having clear explicit guidelines ahead of time not afterwards ahead of time where you can say here are the guidelines<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9850.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: And from the guidelines, any rational person could say that's in or out of bounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9856.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's how you avoid a First Amendment case here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9859.568s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm going to guess that other schools that have the painting thing have already been through this, probably didn't get it done beforehand and then had to deal with the consequences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9871.314s">[Ruseau]</a>: But we really should find out what other districts are using for guidelines, the exact language and see if...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9878.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: we like any of that, because that does worry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9882.316s">[Ruseau]</a>: It'll just eat up huge amounts of resources and time and lawsuits, God forbid, but lawsuits cost a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9891.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm very worried about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9893.87s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm also...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9897.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about, I'm not concerned about the $75 to paint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9900.995s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm concerned about the $75 to park.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9904.637s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that it was mentioned that we would set some money aside to help kids that couldn't afford it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9911.28s">[Ruseau]</a>: But as some of you have heard many times,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9915.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, not all, there's a lot of new members here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9917.476s">[Ruseau]</a>: So most of you haven't heard a lot of the things I've had to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9920.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: But by the time you're in high school, if you don't have the resources, you're not asking for help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9927.259s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9929.1s">[Ruseau]</a>: When you spent your childhood being aware that you don't have the resources, you've learned to just stop asking because that's not for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9937.142s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's for the kids with the resources.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9939.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm opposed to charging $75 to park, $75 to paint,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9948.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm still open to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9950.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10432.814s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10435.361s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's another relevant to the vote.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10441.986s">[Ruseau]</a>: But having funds available for student activities is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10448.524s">[Ruseau]</a>: is a budgetary issue that, you know, right now it's everybody just raise all the money you can, any which way you can, rather than just providing you a reasonable amount of student activity money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10459.271s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that that's an issue we need to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10464.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully, if the overrides pass, we can put a small amount of money, small budget-wise, not necessarily small if you're a student and you want to use student activity money, but money directly into that rather than just relying exclusively on,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10481.006s">[Ruseau]</a>: using all your free time to raise money, which I mean, all of us were teenagers once, some of us very recently, and you probably could do something else with your time other than raising money for your favorite clubs, like doing the activities in the clubs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10497.721s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I hope we can get to that point where we're not expecting that of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10503.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10526.013s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10527.954s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to waive the second reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10550.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10551.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this, as I mentioned in our last meeting, is one of many policies I'll be putting forward to deal with the Title IX changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10560.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10561.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10562.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX changes that came from the Department of Education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=10565.512s">[Ruseau]</a>: recently and our professional association provided templates well they provided the language um and so this is one of many they they come together and sort of as a set but rather than making us have to pass um 45 pages of policy in one night um they're broken up so i assume everybody can read but it's on harassment and retaliation<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11023.391s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also, you know, I was talking to a friend who lives in Cambridge about this question, and it was interesting because she's a highly engaged voter, an attorney.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11035.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: She had read the actual state packet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11038.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's a little booklet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11041.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: The booklet that comes out and explains it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11044.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: And she had read it, and her impression was that it removed the MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11049.298s">[Ruseau]</a>: And<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11050.529s">[Ruseau]</a>: I haven't received mine yet, so I haven't read it yet, so I don't know what the language is exactly, but I think it's such an important thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11056.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: We, first of all, in Massachusetts, cannot end.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11060.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: If it's not MCAS, it has to be something else, because the federal government requires that we do this testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11066.386s">[Ruseau]</a>: The federal government does not require that it be a graduation requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11072.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: we could not, the state could not end MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11076.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if they did, they just have to institute something new and give it a new name that would be MCAS.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11083.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think anybody who's afraid that we're going to stop being able to compare Medford to other districts, if that's something you want to do and you want this one test, you'll still be able to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11095.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: But it does mean, and you know, it's...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11099.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: it's talked about as it's not a common thing but it does happen where students are excellent students they are engaged they get great grades but they are for whatever reason just incapable of passing this test they cannot get a diploma in this state which is insanity teachers assess their students all the time and if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11125.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: professionals with masters and PhDs think that this student is, is competent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11130.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know why that isn't good enough, rather than a test that was written by, frankly, not educators in, you know, some offices somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11141.305s">[Ruseau]</a>: And why did Desi move?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11144.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know where, I don't know where they moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11147.796s">[Ruseau]</a>: that they're the wrong people to determine that this person is ready for graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11152.185s">[Ruseau]</a>: And before that, before we had the MCAS requirements for graduation,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11156.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: we were still at the top, Massachusetts as a whole, was still at the top for education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11161.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not like the MCAS made us number one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11164.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: We were number one before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11166.294s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think the harm that the stress, the pressure, the teach to the test, all that other stuff, it's just negatively impacting education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11178.876s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not exactly news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11180.896s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm very supportive of getting rid of the MCAS requirement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11184.717s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11346.03s">[Ruseau]</a>: I need a giant screen, but then nobody will be able to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11352.655s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11412.167s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Mayor Longo-Kern has abstained due to conflict of interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11498.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11503.051s">[Ruseau]</a>: I actually submitted two policies and the other one got dropped by accident because somebody thought it was the same policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11511.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: So on the next agenda, there will be a different one, which is around use by students and staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11543.71s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the amendment is to add to the listing of the products<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=230.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello, everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=230.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm Paul Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=233.533s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm on the school committee as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=235.554s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've been in office since January of 2018.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=240.177s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I am not going to repeat everything that was just said, but I am looking forward to the opportunity to have a budget where we are not just cutting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=248.842s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have literally just cut budgets forever, at least for 40 years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=254.325s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the number goes up, but that doesn't mean it is actually going up because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=258.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: inflation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=260.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to perhaps having a budget season where we can talk about doing more with more and it's exciting and I look forward to hearing the questions and trying to answer them as best I can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=277.054s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1118.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I would just add to Jenny's rosy outlook is that the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1129.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have, as Jenny mentioned, in 2020 when the budgets were level funded, we said goodbye to 40 something people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1140.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when people hear level funded, they often think of their own budgets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1146.383s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're not gonna just buy anything else.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1148.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: But unlike your own budgets, we have contracts with our union partners and those are still legally enforced.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1156.367s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1157.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: When we negotiate with our unions, it's a negotiation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1162.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're partners with them, and we often talk about the annual increase, the cost of living increase of 2.5%, 2%, 3%, whatever it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1173.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think there's a misconception that that is actually how much the increase cost for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1179.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's just use the teachers as an example because I brought that contract up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1183.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we give the teachers a two and a half percent increase, give, we negotiate, it's not a gift.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1191.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: They, each of, except for the teachers that have been here the longest, most teachers are moving up a step, meaning they are a year more of service, and they're getting much more than 2.5 or 3%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1204.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: In fact, I just did the calculations, and in 2023, a Step 10 teacher, so a teacher who had been here for 10 years, that same teacher, one year later, in 2024, would make between 12.9 and 13% more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1220.869s">[Ruseau]</a>: That is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1222.486s">[Ruseau]</a>: nothing weird, that's normal in districts across the, in any contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1227.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: You have another year of service, you get paid more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1231.652s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the total for that one staff member, 12 or 13%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1236.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not the 2.5% we negotiated with the union.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1239.577s">[Ruseau]</a>: So Prop 2.5 really is a problem because even if we stuck to 2.5%, nobody could ever get more than 2.5% in our negotiations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1251.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: well, that's fine, but everybody's, other than the people who've been here the longest who kind of max out, everybody else is getting more than that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1260.368s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that's part of the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1263.929s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a problem, it's the way it's supposed to work, but it's also a sort of a misconception.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1269.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: And as for what else would be cut, you know, the 2.2 million or whatever the number was that we didn't even,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1279.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: get to discuss in the spring.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1283.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's like a whole elementary school of staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1287.527s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a couple of people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1290.75s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not an administrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1292.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not a school committee getting no pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1295.094s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not anything anybody here can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1300.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1302.18s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we never even could get to that conversation because<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1308.193s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's doomsday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1310.294s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how do you sit around and talk about, OK, so which elementary school are we shutting down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1316.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are we getting rid of all of the arts, and all of music, and all of sports, and still not coming to $2.2 million?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1323.085s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because that is a lot of money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1326.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: So what the cuts would look like, frankly, we don't have an answer that's very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1336.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, a bloodbath sounds very, very melodramatic, but it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1343.978s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not an exaggeration if we don't pass these, what kind of cuts we're looking at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1350.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I have my own thoughts on where on earth we would make such major cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1357.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: My personal preference is that everybody hurts, not just one group of students or one level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1363.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have to do this, because Medford votes against it, then I want to make sure the pain is distributed to all kids and families, because it's not fair to just focus on one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1376.983s">[Ruseau]</a>: one group of folks, everybody should have to suffer equally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1383.625s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's, it's dark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1385.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's very dark, but that's also reality.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1404.417s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just wanna interrupt and say that that is based on our current pay scales.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1410.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not, we're negotiating with our parents, we're negotiating with our teachers, all of those things are gonna go up as they normally would and should.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1419.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that is an absolute low ball number based on the data from June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1425.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I expect it to be higher if we have to have that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1986.263s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will add Jenny covered a lot of that the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1992.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of the less sexy stuff is we have one HR person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=1998.514s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have one payroll person for 1,100 employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2002.355s">[Ruseau]</a>: To put that in context, Shore Collaborative has two HR people and is a teensy, teensy fraction of the size of Medford Public Schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2012.597s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so while those are just two examples of where we need to add staff,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2020.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are things when we finalize a contract with our union partners, it takes months often to get them their retro pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2030.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: Months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2032.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because it is an exorbitant amount of work for one person to do, who's also doing weekly payroll for 1,100 people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2042.515s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's, you know, we have like the city, you know, Jenny talked earlier, maybe it was Zach about how, you know, the schools, every penny we get, especially in this spring, it was by telling everybody else in the rest of the city, you can't have any of your requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2061.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, we have departments with like the one man standing and just like the city, we have some departments where there's just one person left and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2072.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, if it takes months to get your retro pay after you finally, you know, everybody's celebrating, we finally got that contract done, it's bad for morale.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2086.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like an edge case, but these are the kinds of things that drive the culture of the school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2093.919s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, from a staffing perspective, the distrust that we can successfully do anything is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2103.123s">[Ruseau]</a>: definitely, in my opinion, heavily influenced by the fact that we lack enough staff to do to execute on many things that in other organizations would just be so mundane and boring, it would never be a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2119.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if the most simple thing is really, really hard because there's one poor soul responsible for two or three jobs, it just isn't good for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2131.891s">[Ruseau]</a>: It isn't good for the staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2133.853s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's just many, many examples where what we can do to improve things, I mean, busing, it's a long list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2144.454s">[Ruseau]</a>: The, I think probably the most important thing is the school day, as Jenny mentioned, and we don't know what that will really cost exactly, because we have to negotiate that, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2157.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're gonna ask people to work more time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2160.546s">[Ruseau]</a>: So like anybody else, if your work day got longer, you'd expect to be paid more, so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2760.786s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, Jenny already covered it, so I don't need to repeat it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2763.027s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2764.488s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2925.003s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, so I've been on the school committee for seven years, and while running for office, I heard that Medford had this massive administrative crew of people, vastly more than every other district around us, as is the usual assertion for every claim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2943.751s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it turns out that, of course, that isn't true.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2947.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: And while we do have two assistant superintendents and a superintendent and a director of finance,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2954.782s">[Ruseau]</a>: What?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2956.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: What other districts often have, if they don't have as many assistant superintendents, is many, many, many more lower-level administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2968.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: In some districts, every single building has, by grade level, a person responsible for curriculum, for math at fifth grade, at this school, a person responsible for science at this grade, at this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2985.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have none of that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2987.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: Done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2988.76s">[Ruseau]</a>: So our administrators are doing the work of, frankly, so many people, it's sort of, again, it's absurd.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=2997.126s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the work they're doing is not work that's optional.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3002.81s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of times there's enormous amounts of reporting and regulatory stuff that they're involved in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3009.874s">[Ruseau]</a>: They execute on all the things the school committee asked them to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3014.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we just do not have a heavy<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3018.42s">[Ruseau]</a>: administrative, we don't have a lot of administrators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3021.982s">[Ruseau]</a>: And administrators, also people have very different ideas on what the word administrator means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3027.425s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have an administrator's union, which has our directors of curriculum, director of science, director of math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3036.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: And my entire time I have been on the school committee, we have had people doing double duty, sometimes triple duty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3045.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: covering three different departments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3047.956s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, that's just not normal in other school districts that are even remotely better funded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3056.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when you have one person who's responsible for humanities, social studies, and English, and is covering foreign language,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3067.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: First of all, that person usually will have a specialty, which, you know, maybe that's English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3071.392s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how much are they able to really do in those other disciplines?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3076.976s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we have great teachers, and often that is the only reason we have continued to have a quality education in Medford at all, is because our teachers are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3086.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the lack of anybody above,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3092.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Providing any kind of leadership has often not been the end of the world.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3097.029s">[Ruseau]</a>: But things change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3098.31s">[Ruseau]</a>: The state changes the guidelines for what is required for social studies curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3104.735s">[Ruseau]</a>: And these are constantly changing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3108.037s">[Ruseau]</a>: And when you don't have any leaders to focus on that, because the teachers are busy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3112.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3115.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you don't have any of these administrators, then we don't have the ability to get that done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3120.002s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have been working on the science of reading and that's been an assistant superintendent, a director of humanities and a whole host of other staff and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3131.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're not, it's not like a five minute part of their job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3134.258s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like a huge, huge effort that's multi-years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3137.92s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are not only not administration heavy, I think we are administration light.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3146.064s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, my inclusion of administration is having enough people in HR and payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3152.127s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think of administration as the people in central office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3157.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think people have very different ideas of what administration means, but we are definitely, we don't have anywhere near enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3164.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we need two more assistant superintendents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3166.574s">[Ruseau]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3166.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do I think we even need another assistant superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3169.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3170.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need people working under them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3173.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: that they can delegate to because they are completely swamped with incoming mandates and crises that are normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3182.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: They're normal parts of running a school system that can often swallow up anything that they were already in the process of actually doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3192.685s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I just wanted to answer that question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3194.406s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3489.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, I'm itching to answer the question about short staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3492.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: Since the schools are short-staffed, are we seeing high rates of burnout, turnover, and could we use these funds to help improve retention in the schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3499.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3500.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: We lost our<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3504.947s">[Ruseau]</a>: not treasurer, I forget, the controller to Somerville, making 20 grand more to do the same job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3512.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: The catch here for that is that because we're missing so many positions, people leaving for better pay, or even if they aren't leaving for better pay, they are leaving for dramatically less work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3530.402s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't mean to suggest they don't want to work or that they're lazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3533.563s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3534.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of these folks that are leaving are working absurd numbers of hours for the pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3541.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it's absurd numbers of hours regardless of the pay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3543.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: People want to actually do something other than just work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3546.458s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when we lose somebody like a...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3551.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: Controller, she didn't just leave with the knowledge of what it's to technically do the job of the controller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3557.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: She left with all the other knowledge for all the other stuff she had been doing because there was nobody else to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3564.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so that vanishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3566.14s">[Ruseau]</a>: We hire a new controller who comes in to be a controller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3570.418s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then there's just this gigantic gap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3574.04s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that has happened many times in my time here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3579.122s">[Ruseau]</a>: And replacing that person with a better salary, which you often have to do to even recruit somebody,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3588.604s">[Ruseau]</a>: It solves the problem of that slot, but you didn't get what you had before, not even close, because that person rarely was doing the job that is their job description.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3602.331s">[Ruseau]</a>: They were doing much more and it's a huge problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3608.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: So when we talk about like,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3611.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: improving retention is often a very expensive endeavor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3615.981s">[Ruseau]</a>: It isn't just about people giving people a raise, which sometimes that is an answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3619.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is about adding whole other people, more people to do the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3624.767s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's always a dramatically more expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3627.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you can give somebody a $20,000 raise, that's a lot cheaper than buying another person for 90,000 or whatever hiring, not buying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3635.315s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3638.837s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of these problems are truly very expensive to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3643.682s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's just what it costs to, you know, our business office is understaffed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3648.907s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I've talked about that so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3651.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: But as a school committee member, you know, right out of the gate, I had all kinds of questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3656.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: that could never be answered and have not been answered in seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3660.008s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3660.649s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because if we had a modern financial system, somebody would go in, they'd write some little report and click print or email me an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3670.854s">[Ruseau]</a>: Without those systems, it's weeks of somebody going through multiple systems trying to figure out what's that over there, what's that over there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3678.541s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm not exaggerating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3679.722s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like we have things, there's a monthly report where we're legally supposed to get every month, a hires and terminations report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3688.809s">[Ruseau]</a>: All the districts around us get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3690.531s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know about it because of the Shore Collaborative where I'm the Medford School Committee representative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3695.815s">[Ruseau]</a>: Everybody gets it, the Shore gets it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3698.362s">[Ruseau]</a>: We don't get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3699.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3699.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because we don't have a modern system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3700.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our HR is not connected to our payroll.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3702.943s">[Ruseau]</a>: And is getting that report worth paying somebody for 40 or 80 hours of work every month?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3710.525s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3713.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this burnout issue is a really important one, but it's also very expensive to solve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3720.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is not just a matter of looking at how much does a controller make in other districts and say, oh, we're going to pay them that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3727.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: they're still gonna burn out because they're doing multiple jobs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=3730.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry to beat that one down, but it's been seven years of complaining about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4345.484s">[Ruseau]</a>: Awesome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4346.124s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4346.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm with Jenny on the, you know, it's so long overdue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4777.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to add that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4780.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are great questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4782.636s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are undoubtedly 500 other questions that a group this size has.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4789.679s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I know that I certainly, and I'm quite sure the other elected officials here, would be happy to make ourselves available to sit with you one-on-one to answer your questions and to get into the details.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4801.985s">[Ruseau]</a>: As Zach and Jenny and Matt alluded to, some of these things are sort of outrageously complicated.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4808.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: and not very well suited to this kind of a setting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=4814.012s">[Ruseau]</a>: And really, I will make myself available to anyone that wants to have a conversation about understanding something because a lot of the stuff is really, really hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5138.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/S1kX6bu_Ul8&t=5138.892s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=389.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think I found it, Jenny.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=390.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll put it in the chat for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=765.121s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, Member Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=768.864s">[Ruseau]</a>: The FY25 for the Brooks water heater, didn't that come in at $267,000?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1250.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1254.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1256.223s">[Ruseau]</a>: Peter, do we know if that included handling<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1260.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, these would be networked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1262.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: So do we know if that included figuring out how we're going to network at the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1309.67s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly like to be involved in any conversation on that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=1313.092s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep, happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2538.944s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I just don't want to disagree with Peter, but we are definitely, you sort of almost got there where I was going, but we're just cutting future kids, not the kids in front of us now, is what we're doing, as if they don't matter anywhere near as much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2557.828s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that's really, I do think that treating it as, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2568.342s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a, what's the word I'm looking at?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2570.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a values proposition here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2574.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: By not cutting from any of the kids now, everybody, the kids, the community can think everything is dandy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2581.489s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then we end up in full-on crisis when there's nothing left that can be done, which is where we are in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2588.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think, by the way, that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2594.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, it's been a couple of years it's been a couple of decades at least.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2597.6s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, yeah, I'm sort of beating that horse but it is, these are these are decisions that I think very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2607.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: We need to make and understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2611.598s">[Ruseau]</a>: do things do cost more over time, even if they don't get more expensive, you know, exponentially, at a minimum, they're gonna get more expensive from inflation and all the other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2623.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yeah, we've got to stop saying no, and we've got to, if we need a million dollars in maintenance costs a year, and we have to choose between maintaining our facilities or taking services away from kids, we need to take services away from kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2965.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: The only other thing I see in the bottom list that I think it would behoove us to have as soon as possible is the electrification assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2977.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, I have no clue how expensive that is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2981.688s">[Ruseau]</a>: It seems like the kind of thing you do at one elementary school and you can copy and paste.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2988.691s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the middle schools as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=2991.493s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I don't actually think it makes any sense to consider electrification at the high school at this moment in time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3002.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for the other schools, I think knowing what it would cost so we're not dealing with a break fix scenario and don't have a real understanding of the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3015.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: the gulf between what an electrification option would be and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3022.324s">[Ruseau]</a>: going with gas or whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.247s">[Ruseau]</a>: So not $800.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3377.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3442.113s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's like project management as well or no?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3618.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: Um, member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3621.098s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3622.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm looking at the policy, and you may be going right next to this, but we are supposed to create four lists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3630.644s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, we have one list all done, which is the all projects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3633.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're looking at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3636.048s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, when we pass this, you know, one of the lists is projects that are eligible for Community Preservation Act funding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3646.075s">[Ruseau]</a>: net school spending, and then things that are not eligible for either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3651.898s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm just wondering, who has the expertise to decide whether something is eligible for CPC funding or CPA funding?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=3757.099s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I don't even think, that's not really an opinion, that's fact kind of thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4212.398s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, I think we can.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4219.519s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to continue the meeting to a date yet to be determined.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4233.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4234.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: To November 19th then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4235.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: At what time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4237.084s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do we know that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MVExTf_vuaw&t=4239.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Five o'clock.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2503.988s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2507.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of these fixtures, I mean, we were talking about one part per billion, 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2514.836s">[Ruseau]</a>: And, you know, we have a sink at Medford High with 967 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2524.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: The thing is, is that all of the really bad stuff isn't at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2529.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the worst two are at Medford High.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2534.078s">[Ruseau]</a>: 235 parts per billion at the Andrews, 180 at the McGlynn Middle.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2541.063s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there are 176 fixtures over 15 parts per billion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2549.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm obviously very interested in mitigation, but I really hope that how we are here and why we are here doesn't get any kind of sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2563.43s">[Ruseau]</a>: No sugarcoating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2564.13s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2566.931s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is not okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2570.192s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I mean, 967 parts per billion, I bet DCF would take a kid out of a house.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2577.335s">[Ruseau]</a>: Seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2578.255s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like that's like, well, I can't do that kind of math at this hour that quickly, but hundreds of times over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2587.162s">[Ruseau]</a>: the maximum amount before you have to shut down equipment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2592.587s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I look forward to the results of the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2596.651s">[Ruseau]</a>: I look forward to all the very graphic detailed reports explaining what was snaked and looked at and where every fixture that does get replaced, I want those fixtures saved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2607.831s">[Ruseau]</a>: need to know where they came from, how they were purchased, how did we end up with them, if it was a fixture.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2613.416s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously if it's not a fixture then we got to find the root cause.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2616.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't want it to just be we replace the 376 fixtures, it costs a million dollars or whatever it costs, and we throw them all in the dump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2627.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: There needs to be answers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2628.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, for the Medford High stuff, the answer is that's what it was when we built it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2633.055s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for everything else, I want to know who received funding to sell us a piece of equipment that was not necessarily allowed at that point in time, because I just can't believe that these levels are a result of purchasing the appropriate stuff and putting it in front of children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2656.73s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I do have a question about whether or not it makes sense for the school committee to draft a policy on required testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2663.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: One of the things that's very unclear right now is like, what does it cost to test every fixture in our whole school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2670.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, is it $50,000 a year or is it a vastly bigger number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2676.799s">[Ruseau]</a>: And without that number, it feels like<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2679.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, my gut test everything every single year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2682.646s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if you tell me it's going to cost a million dollars a year, then my gut starts to feel a little less comfortable with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2689.014s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I understand that this testing we weren't paying for, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2696.537s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was a grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2697.358s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, if we can get an estimate for what it would actually cost for us to do this on the regular, I would like to know that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2706.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: Some of how much on the regular would depend very much on the investigation as to how we are here and why we are here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2714.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we find out that this certain fixtures were purchased and they had lead in them and we replaced them, then it makes sense that we don't have to test those fixtures regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2726.513s">[Ruseau]</a>: But those schools are 24 years old.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2730.015s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm looking back at the data on the state's website there are a few from 2016 or 2018 but pretty much nothing ever since.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2738.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I want to make sure we're never, we don't leave a future school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2742.387s">[Ruseau]</a>: and certainly kids and staff to discover that they've been consuming this stuff for decades.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2751.394s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's, I don't know if I have a question, but those are my comments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2755.757s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5002.364s">[Ruseau]</a>: Make a motion to waive the reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5033.366s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=5035.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to waive the second reading of policy GBEB.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3645.559s">[Ruseau]</a>: to go up on that point of transparency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3647.8s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at the last budget we just passed for the schools, you'll see that there appears to be a $3.5 million increase in transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3656.565s">[Ruseau]</a>: If you look at our transportation contract, it's actually, we pay them more per year than our last budget's total transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3666.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: because it shouldn't make any sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3668.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, in the past, because our budget wasn't big enough, we would not be school committee, but, you know, the finance people and the superintendent would get together and they would just like start erasing numbers and making them smaller to get down to a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3682.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: Because by law, every penny we spend in our budget has to be tied directly to where that penny's coming from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3688.973s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's no wishful thinking in a budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3691.374s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it looks like our budget for transportation went up $3.5 million this year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3696.955s">[Ruseau]</a>: It didn't go up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3697.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: It went up a little bit, like 80,000, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3700.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where is it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3701.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: The rest of that money, previous years, was just not on the budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3705.016s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then you would not hire some people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3708.693s">[Ruseau]</a>: They take some money from these accounts that aren't really for transportation and pay the bills that way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3713.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: And you have no idea how much it costs to run this district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3718.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this is the first budget in the time that I've been on the school committee where the transportation line item says what we have to spend for transportation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3726.023s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a very simple example because it's such a stark jump.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3729.906s">[Ruseau]</a>: But there were budgets since I've been on the school committee where we have full-time special education<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3736.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: permanent teachers, and if you looked in the budget, their salary on the budget says zero dollars, because it wasn't enough money, but we weren't gonna fire them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3744.567s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we just kept them in the budget with a zero, and then on July 1st, we started paying them, and we didn't pay for other things that we needed to pay for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3753.713s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the budget has always, in my time, in seven years, this is the first budget that actually makes any sense to anybody reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3761.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that's a level of transparency that I'm just thrilled by.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=3766.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really hard because it does mean that if you decide you're gonna be transparent, next year if transportation is 4.1 million, you can't just suddenly decide it's gonna, well, we'll put three there so we can keep these teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=4755.602s">[Ruseau]</a>: Our next question, we discussed this a little bit in the beginning of the panel through the remarks offered by our three panelists.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=75.953s">[Ruseau]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=76.413s">[Ruseau]</a>: Uh, member Brantley, I believe member Graham here, member and Tapa absent member Olopade here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=87.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Reinfeldt here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=89.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Members, so present Maryland, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=166.135s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=167.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is a very long policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=170.036s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would never draft a policy of this length.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=174.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's so long that we might be the only people to ever read it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=178.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: But this came from our professional association and came down from a set of lawyers that they contract with regarding Title IX changes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=189.424s">[Ruseau]</a>: Title IX has sort of been batted back and forth through each of the administrations that we have had<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=195.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: White House.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=196.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is the Biden version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=199.668s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully, we don't have to go through all of this again in the next couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=205.351s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is one of many policies that we have been going through related to Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=211.054s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the grievance procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=213.275s">[Ruseau]</a>: So anybody who wishes to file a grievance through Title IX would follow this procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=220.659s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is a lot of preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=224.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then there are step-by-steps, who has what rights and when.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=230.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will admit that I lack knowledge about prior versions of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=235.408s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I can't really speak to what changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=240.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=242.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, if you, I didn't even ask you, but is there any big, giant change that you feel?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=249.78s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is it just such a wholesale change that you don't?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=293.231s">[Ruseau]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=293.532s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=295.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: So not having the knowledge of the previous one, it sounds like really fleshing out the areas where there was always litigation, because it's like, well, what does that really mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=305.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=306.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's good news.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=307.274s">[Ruseau]</a>: If we have an update of this size, it's good to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=310.629s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hello, member of family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=314.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, I attempted to do an AI summary and I failed because this is too big for the free AIs to ingest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=328.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I wasn't about to pay for a AI subscription just to be able to do it on this one giant policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=335.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=338.877s">[Ruseau]</a>: we could go through it page by page or section by section and just like this is what this section means.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=346.081s">[Ruseau]</a>: I personally have a strong dislike of the idea of reading it because I did time it if we were to have<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=355.581s">[Ruseau]</a>: a Siri or AI read us the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=358.924s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's an hour and 27 minutes just without us stopping or having questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=366.249s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was with a pretty fast voice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=368.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm hoping nobody here is desiring that we do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=372.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other thing I<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=376.004s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll know in the policy, and this is something new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=378.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: I've never put this in a policy before.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=380.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: At the very end, there's a statement that I think we might want to put into other policies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=385.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: It says, updates to contact information of school staff identified within this policy may be made without school committee notification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=393.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think it's bad form to have in your policies, like the names and phone numbers of individuals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=400.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: But in this case where it's sort of part of the point of the policy is that that's all there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=406.344s">[Ruseau]</a>: I thought this was a good workaround.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=408.024s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are not reviewing this policy every single time a staff member retires or we hire somebody new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=415.467s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's sort of the outlier for how the policy language is drafted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=423.429s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's the 10-mile diversion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=434.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'll make that motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=446.948s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Brandley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=450.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=452.872s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa is presently absent still, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=459.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=459.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=460.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=461.558s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=461.778s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=462.038s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=549.908s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=553.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that that language went to the lawyers I forget the law firm that ma SC uses, and they.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=560.228s">[Ruseau]</a>: expanded upon and translated it as much as was actually needed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=564.889s">[Ruseau]</a>: I didn't read the DESE, I mean, not the DESE, the Department of Ed Language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=569.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if they simply copied it and stuck their name on it, I wouldn't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=573.252s">[Ruseau]</a>: But yeah, this is, I did not make changes other than updating the contact information, replacing the district with Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=583.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I also, there were a few places of punctuation and,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=589.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: Frankly, there were some typos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=592.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: But so other than that, I did not change the content.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=595.173s">[Ruseau]</a>: Although, of course, malegal perspective, a comma can matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=599.436s">[Ruseau]</a>: I was very cautious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=601.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I use Grammarly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=604.059s">[Ruseau]</a>: Grammarly has a lot of recommendations to make this thing better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=607.701s">[Ruseau]</a>: I did not take any of them other than where a comma was necessary or not necessary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=616.106s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was clearly just a mistake in the drafting of the language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=620.822s">[Ruseau]</a>: I really didn't like the format.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=622.684s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's so many levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=625.826s">[Ruseau]</a>: But again, I felt uncomfortable really making a big change because it did come from lawyers and because Title IX is such a gigantic, complex thing that I don't fully understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=637.156s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's where we're at.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=655.555s">[Ruseau]</a>: So would you like me to share the screen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=662.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, I think that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=699.622s">[Ruseau]</a>: Just realize you can't see me shaking my head probably because I have this text up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=703.485s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't have anything on the preamble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=741.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: Interesting that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=744.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can search.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=746.483s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm searching too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=747.543s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so there's 26 instances of the words sex discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=758.028s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's 43 of sexual discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=760.51s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will say that it is not the only thing in this document that I have similar concerns about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=769.176s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I don't actually know technically if there are differences between the two.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=772.738s">[Ruseau]</a>: They seem like the same thing to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=787.415s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, I'm fine with a fine and replace sex discrimination with sexual discrimination if nobody has any reason to disagree with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=834.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=836.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: We will completely mess up the formatting to add a few characters anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=855.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham, are you looking at the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=861.329s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I'm on page three to page... Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=868.732s">[Ruseau]</a>: Six.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=869.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=869.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=870.072s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=873.109s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, definitions, I don't think they're particularly consistent, but I don't want us to have to engage lawyers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=913.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I could just kind of give like quick go through the steps process real quick?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=919.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, that would be great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=920.901s">[Ruseau]</a>: So starts out with who may<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=924.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: file reports, and it's anyone, which I think is interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=929.242s">[Ruseau]</a>: It doesn't have to be the victim or whatever the proper term isn't, according to the definitions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=938.77s">[Ruseau]</a>: How to report the discrimination is in the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=945.62s">[Ruseau]</a>: These are not steps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=946.56s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=947.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: Again, this organization of this document was a challenge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=951.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's internal reporting that's related to employees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=958.465s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is the district response to the report, which, of course, the district will respond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=965.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: There are five<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=969.431s">[Ruseau]</a>: things that the district will do promptly and confidentially, contact the complainant, inform the complainant of supportive measures, consider the complainant's wishes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=985.057s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't really know what the point of number four is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=995.261s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=997.677s">[Ruseau]</a>: The complainant will have, it will be explained to the complainant what the process is for filing the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1004.921s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next we have filing itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1008.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is the actual process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1013.245s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who may file it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1015.466s">[Ruseau]</a>: A much longer version.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1016.526s">[Ruseau]</a>: This document is very good at repeating itself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1020.689s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a much longer version of who may file the process again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1028.61s">[Ruseau]</a>: in longer words, more words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1039.257s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did it say step one somewhere?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1040.578s">[Ruseau]</a>: It did, I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1041.539s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1041.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: So step two is the consideration of supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1046.702s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the complainant and the respondent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1051.265s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step three is written notice of the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1075.711s">[Ruseau]</a>: For the rest of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1093.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, there was a section up here about, what was it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1102.672s">[Ruseau]</a>: Was it up here?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1158.834s">[Ruseau]</a>: Shall I continue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1161.616s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the hard thing is, of course, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1164.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think the hard part is, of course, without specific examples, it gets really, this is not easy stuff to draft.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1173.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so those are the written notice, what will be included in the notice, there will be a statement for evading retaliation, of course, submitting false information, all the things you'd expect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1198.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step four is the consideration of whether to dismiss the formal complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1207.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there are some mandatory, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1216.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1223.35s">[Ruseau]</a>: Even Grammarly didn't notice that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1233.759s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1234.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, step four is about whether or not the complaint is subject to mandatory discretionary dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1240.903s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the district cannot identify the.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1249.968s">[Ruseau]</a>: Respondent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1252.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: which is often known as the accused in regular language, then of course there's no way to further deal with the complaint.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1268.397s">[Ruseau]</a>: There is may dismiss, these are the may dismiss.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1273.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if the person is not involved in their educational programs and is not involved with the district, we may dismiss, not to say we have to,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1285.888s">[Ruseau]</a>: if the complainant voluntarily withdraws.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1298.851s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then there's more stuff about dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1301.371s">[Ruseau]</a>: So it's really hard to summarize without just reading it, but I'm not reading it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1317.506s">[Ruseau]</a>: If the dismissal is appealed, the district will do a set of things, notifying all the right people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1325.927s">[Ruseau]</a>: When the complaint is dismissed, the district will at a minimum offer supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1335.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: Respondent will be notified of the allegations and supportive measures will be offered there as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1342.27s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why is this underscored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1344.611s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1347.222s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, yeah, so let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1352.183s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's more just dismissal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1354.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: A lot of stuff, but- Six is really important there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1357.545s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so let me read that one since I can't remember it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1360.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: Dismissal of a formal complaint for purposes of Title IX nominal exclude the district from addressing allegations under any other relevant district policies or procedures, including but not limited to the civil rights grievance procedure,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1374.269s">[Ruseau]</a>: the bullying prevention and intervention plan, that thing, the student code of conduct and or collective bargaining contract, nor will it preclude the district from addressing the allegations pursuant to the grievance process in section two of this procedure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1392.438s">[Ruseau]</a>: The Title IX coordinator shall have the discretion to make any such referrals and proceed as appropriate in regard to the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1400.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: So just because a dismissal within this final line has happened, that doesn't mean it's the end, necessarily.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1420.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1421.715s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next step five is the initial inventory deletion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1425.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the details on what the district will do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1430.763s">[Ruseau]</a>: Standard of proof.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1433.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: The burden is on the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1438.911s">[Ruseau]</a>: Collection of evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1440.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1448.15s">[Ruseau]</a>: Presentation of witnesses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1453.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll have no, there'll be no gag orders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1461.844s">[Ruseau]</a>: Each party will have one advisor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1475.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: written notice to seek privacy medical treatment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1478.536s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the district cannot access medical information in any situation here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1489.548s">[Ruseau]</a>: Unless of course they can unless they consent to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1494.741s">[Ruseau]</a>: the investigator timelines.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1497.723s">[Ruseau]</a>: So speed matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1500.125s">[Ruseau]</a>: It always matters to everybody involved in these things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1503.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think that's one of the changes that did happen that there used to be a 10 day waiting period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1510.712s">[Ruseau]</a>: Imagine if you're involved in this as the victim or accused or whatever the proper terms here are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1518.056s">[Ruseau]</a>: And once all the investigations are done, everybody has to sit on their hands for 10 business days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1524.639s">[Ruseau]</a>: everybody's going to school, everybody's, you know, it didn't make a lot of sense.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1530.303s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think that was one big change that they made is that that 10 day mandatory waiting period is gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1537.047s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1551.235s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1552.776s">[Ruseau]</a>: No, we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1553.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, I think that for minor things, I think everybody would think reasonable is, you know, same day, a day or two, but for major, major things, I can certainly see it taking many days or longer once there's lawyers and, you know, all kinds of other things involved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1581.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then there's, this is the opportunity for parties to access and respond to the evidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1589.145s">[Ruseau]</a>: The evidence, there's limitation in here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1595.226s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we have to redact confidential information not directly related to the allegations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1601.908s">[Ruseau]</a>: FERPA is very much still in effect here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1604.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is an override FERPA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1610.194s">[Ruseau]</a>: And for anybody in the public that wants to know, that's the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which is, you'll hear school committee members use it when we respond to you about why we can't actually do things you ask us to do sometimes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1626.886s">[Ruseau]</a>: And everybody is prohibited from disseminating any of the evidence for any purpose not directly related to the grievance procedures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1633.631s">[Ruseau]</a>: So don't take it and go to Facebook or anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1639.494s">[Ruseau]</a>: It is evidence that you have the right to see, but you do not have the right to disseminate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1806.697s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think it's a little helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1809.437s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1810.017s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, if you have any thoughts on that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2075.046s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just want to jump in here also that this is the scenario given there has to be a victim.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2083.549s">[Ruseau]</a>: So a bunch of students getting in trouble for vaping is not Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2087.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Even if we decided we were going to say just the girls are going to get in trouble and not the boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2095.171s">[Ruseau]</a>: The victim where who's the victim the district enforcing a policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2099.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: We're taking action is we, I suppose we could be the perpetrator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2106.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: as a district, but I don't think this policy considers that the district is actually a perpetrator in violation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2113.949s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, obviously plenty of Title IX things are about the district refusing to, you know, deal with sports and all the other types of things, but there are victims there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2127.875s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2134.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, so let me find what page we're on since I've already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2147.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2148.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: Glad somebody's paying attention to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2149.999s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so yeah, all right, so let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2178.482s">[Ruseau]</a>: You're welcome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2181.164s">[Ruseau]</a>: So next up is step seven, completion of the investigative report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2186.633s">[Ruseau]</a>: Then eight is the parties opportunity to respond to the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2191.816s">[Ruseau]</a>: Step nine is directed written questions from the parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2195.858s">[Ruseau]</a>: So after the investigative report has been sent to the parties, but prior to reaching a determination regarding responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2204.283s">[Ruseau]</a>: The decision-maker shall afford both the complainant and the respondent the opportunity to submit to the decision-maker relevant questions of the other party or any witness, provide the party with the other party's and our witnesses' written responses to said questions, and allow for additional limited follow-up questions from each party in writing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2226.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: Questions that seek disclosure information protected under legally recognized privileges, such as FERPA,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2233.638s">[Ruseau]</a>: will, shall not be permitted unless the person holding the privilege waives their right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2238.784s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is, seems pretty standard, not as awful as an actual deposition, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2248.534s">[Ruseau]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2258.516s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there is this 10 days to submit directed relevant questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2262.497s">[Ruseau]</a>: So again, this is still 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2266.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: There was that other 10 days on top of that 10 days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2270.859s">[Ruseau]</a>: It would be hard to feel like things are being taken seriously if we just keep adding two week increments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2275.96s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2286.579s">[Ruseau]</a>: So 10 days to craft your questions, five days to get before your answers are due, another three days, and then another three days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2300.065s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's really, it's no wonder things take forever, but they have to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2305.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, everybody has to do the work and have their rights protected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2312.841s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2313.942s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then step 10 is determination of responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2316.705s">[Ruseau]</a>: Findings are backed by the decision maker.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2319.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: Who's on this call?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2322.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: Joan is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2323.131s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, did Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2323.491s">[Ruseau]</a>: Did we just lose Joan?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2324.472s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2324.972s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, no, there you are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2325.553s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2325.813s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2327.114s">[Ruseau]</a>: She's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2327.755s">[Ruseau]</a>: You moved to the top for some reason on my screen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2332.58s">[Ruseau]</a>: Standard of proof, decision makers' findings,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2339.502s">[Ruseau]</a>: The determination will be written, of course, and sent simultaneously to both parties.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2349.729s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's some more very long time frames here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2354.692s">[Ruseau]</a>: Section C, remedies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2357.053s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is what can be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2362.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's the remedies, the elimination of the harassing environment,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2375.421s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is section D, page will be on 15.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2382.307s">[Ruseau]</a>: Persons doing discipline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2383.848s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is about discipline, as you would imagine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2389.213s">[Ruseau]</a>: However, there is a reference to the two Massachusetts general laws related to behaviors that are attributable to disabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2402.984s">[Ruseau]</a>: We'll go into those, because those stand alone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2408.111s">[Ruseau]</a>: So then there's the imposition of sanctions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2414.198s">[Ruseau]</a>: Compliance with the imposition of the sanctions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2427.617s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so this is sort of important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2429.338s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if there was a determination that it had not happened, or that it was not, sorry, not that it had not happened, that it was not considered, am I misreading this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2449.989s">[Ruseau]</a>: So what does the sentence, this one mean, do you know?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2467.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2498.818s">[Ruseau]</a>: Does that sound right to you, Jo?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2502.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2503.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2507.802s">[Ruseau]</a>: Lawyers, do you know how to make it hard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2546.181s">[Ruseau]</a>: And Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2547.201s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, correct me if I'm wrong, but supportive measures could be quite substantial.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2551.683s">[Ruseau]</a>: Like if we felt the student couldn't be in the building, we would be offering them another option for how to get an education outside of the building.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2558.885s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's not that they just get to come to school and we're like, be nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2564.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's not what we mean.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2565.267s">[Ruseau]</a>: It could be something as significant as that, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2718.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2722.052s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next up we have, did I finish this section?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2725.794s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2728.356s">[Ruseau]</a>: Informal process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2730.517s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's an option to have an informal process if the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2739.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: So here's the right words to describe the different people here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2743.411s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh, one second, Google is, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2746.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: That was crashing on me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2749.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there is an option to have an informal process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2759.795s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2760.996s">[Ruseau]</a>: Next is section F emergency removal under Title IX.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2766.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: The district may remove a respondent on an emergency basis at any time that the district one undertakes an individualized safety and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2777.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: And risk analysis two determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual discrimination justifies removal and that there is no alternative to the respondent's emergency removal to mitigate the threat presented.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2794.146s">[Ruseau]</a>: And three, provides the respondent with notice and the opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following removal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2801.031s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2804.074s">[Ruseau]</a>: Hopefully we never have to use that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2806.658s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anonymous reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2812.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this is that we may take anonymous reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2817.547s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see, we can do supportive measures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2832.978s">[Ruseau]</a>: Cannot provide, oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2836.241s">[Ruseau]</a>: Obviously, we can't do supportive measures if we don't know who is supporting, who is reporting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2844.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's see, that seems, I mean, if we don't know who the reporter is, that's different than confidentially reporting, but there's really not much, there's pretty significant limitations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2864.505s">[Ruseau]</a>: and what could actually be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2866.687s">[Ruseau]</a>: Anybody want to talk about that one at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2912.381s">[Ruseau]</a>: All right, so next up is appeals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2915.583s">[Ruseau]</a>: So there's an entire appeals process, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2919.428s">[Ruseau]</a>: Says who to send the appeal to five days after the determination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2928.435s">[Ruseau]</a>: The decision maker may not take.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2932.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry, the decision maker for the appeal cannot take part in the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2937.341s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could not have taken part in the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2942.538s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we do have the original policy as I received it had frankly a lot more decision makers that we have decided to go with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2954.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: We have some freedom and leeway to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2958.328s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can see both sides of that, but I'll explain that when I get to that section later.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2983.618s">[Ruseau]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2983.778s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen, can you answer that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3050.566s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I think what I'm hearing Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3057.927s">[Ruseau]</a>: Bowen saying is that, frankly, all these people are interchangeable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3061.068s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I mean, if John Bruno was involved, then obviously he's not going to be the investigator or the, I mean, you know,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3073.746s">[Ruseau]</a>: that these are all roles that can just be swapped around to ensure that there's not a conflict.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3079.128s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, we'd have to list every person under every section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3083.53s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then the point is sort of that people know who to call.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3088.772s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think if you were concerned about John Bruno as like you're writing a complaint against him,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3096.243s">[Ruseau]</a>: then obviously you're not going to want him to be the appeals officer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3100.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: He also wouldn't be a very good investigator.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3104.91s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so these are just sort of like defaults is how I take them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3130.825s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3134.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: So where was I on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3137.09s">[Ruseau]</a>: Age 15?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3143.991s">[Ruseau]</a>: So let's see, sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3145.871s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, so we had finished that section there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3149.552s">[Ruseau]</a>: Recordkeeping, so obviously just keep records related to this procedure maintained for a period of seven years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3165.576s">[Ruseau]</a>: I said days, I was confused, years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3173.695s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pretty much standard stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3177.337s">[Ruseau]</a>: Employment agencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3179.278s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is boilerplate stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3183.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Where to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3184.44s">[Ruseau]</a>: Pay is identification of key personnel.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3190.703s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's this section down here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3194.469s">[Ruseau]</a>: And the boilerplate code that I originally had had an investigator at each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3201.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: I can sort of see the value in that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3204.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: On the other hand, if somebody's particularly well-trained in that, then maybe they're a better choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3216.066s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other part of that that I was a little bit like, so McGlynn is,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3221.79s">[Ruseau]</a>: of far away from the Missittook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3225.312s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that means that Mr. O'Brien is going to be doing Title IX investigations over at the Missittook.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3232.375s">[Ruseau]</a>: But on the other side, I also was kind of like, it seems better to have somebody not at your school doing the investigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3239.718s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, if we were to do it where we had really, it would have to be an entire<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3247.827s">[Ruseau]</a>: table of like, if you're here, this is who you contact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3251.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think it gets really messy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3254.773s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I think, you know, Joan's at the top, so Joan's gonna get the calls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3263.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, and this does not preclude an investigator at another school doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3270.39s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3319.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3328.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: So this prominently displayed on the district website.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3332.803s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know if there's anybody who has an idea of what the word prominently displayed means in legalese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3342.907s">[Ruseau]</a>: I will ask, I'll send an email afterwards to ask that, that if it's not already there that, you know, Joan is listed as the title and coordinator maybe in the about or section or somewhere very prominently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3362.168s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't think on the actual main page, just like right there makes a lot of sense, because that gets very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3368.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want to have the non-discrimination statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3371.958s">[Ruseau]</a>: We want to have the district educational statement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3380.086s">[Ruseau]</a>: It just gets very long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3383.669s">[Ruseau]</a>: But that's just my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3385.518s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we are at an hour, and we have sort of been through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3392.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's a lot to digest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3400.149s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we will have another chance at a regular meeting when we do the second reading, which we will not read also, hopefully.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3462.801s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3465.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: You know, whenever I tell people what it's like to be on the school committee, I do talk about that the federal, the state, and, of course, the local, everybody's got their hands in the pie, and nobody talks to each other or cares, frankly, what the other one thinks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3481.083s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we do end up with definitions that can not only be not consistent, but can even be contradictory.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3487.768s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we're just left to sit in that stew.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3495.333s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's tough, especially when you're writing, you know, we write one policy, like the bullying one, which comes from the state house, and we are very specific definitions of, you know, aggressor is the word they use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3510.216s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then here, there's the respondent, which is like the most mild-mannered version of that probably anybody could ever come up with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3520.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3522.607s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we just have to live with the fact that in some policies, we are calling those folks the respondent and other ones that are the aggressor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3529.654s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I think the state one actually has two different words.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3536.82s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3538.601s">[Ruseau]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3538.982s">[Ruseau]</a>: And then, you know, victim isn't even listed in this one as the act in the definition section.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3555.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, it's hard and hopefully nobody has to go through any of this, especially if they have to go through it in multiple offices because that would be terrible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3596.26s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Branley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3609.202s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Soyes, Mayor Lungokirn is absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3641.894s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, um, I know we accidentally did we have 2nd readings 2 meetings ago and then several of us, we already did the 2nd reading.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3650.904s">[Ruseau]</a>: Why is it on the agenda?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3653.147s">[Ruseau]</a>: The 2nd reading has to actually be on the agenda because that's the opportunity for the public to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3658.272s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's like the 2nd chance it's not for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3661.155s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's for the public to be like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3663.573s">[Ruseau]</a>: Oh yeah, if you're watching the meeting and you see something discussed and you wanna discuss it, you may not be prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3671.838s">[Ruseau]</a>: So the second reading I think should happen at the next meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3675.16s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I will be submitting a clarifying rule update to make that clear, cause it's not clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=366.138s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, the votes of the meeting are listed as 5-2, which implies 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=374.863s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was actually 5 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 2 were absent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=1166.645s">[Ruseau]</a>: So yes, Marilyn go current.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2252.045s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2255.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Are you going to explain the requiring assistance or intervention later?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2344.752s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2345.212s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just want to not clarify, because that's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2350.615s">[Ruseau]</a>: I don't know the answer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2351.916s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the score itself,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2354.52s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, Roberts has, for instance, a 41, which is higher than one, two, three, four other schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2364.887s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is it affecting the score or merely the determination of whether we need assistance or intervention?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2375.934s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2377.035s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2761.47s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2762.811s">[Ruseau]</a>: Does the test cover anything to do with local government at all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2768.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I realize there's immense variability, but I mean, I know within every community, there's a vast misunderstanding of how local government works and what our responsibilities and powers are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=2782.091s">[Ruseau]</a>: And it seems like that would be a great opportunity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=4972.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: It was.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6455.572s">[Ruseau]</a>: Members say yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6456.393s">[Ruseau]</a>: Maryland occurrence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6965.199s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6965.899s">[Ruseau]</a>: I also, just for having a love fest, I love Francis too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6970.461s">[Ruseau]</a>: I guess my one, one of my concerns, although the appeal question actually is one I had not thought of that member Graham brought up that jumps out at me as something quite important to understand and have a plan for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6984.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: But the other thing though is, you know, what I don't know is, is Francis<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=6990.635s">[Ruseau]</a>: up-to-date on all of FERPA and all the educational privacy laws that are irrelevant to the city side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7001.463s">[Ruseau]</a>: And access to student information and personnel stuff too, but I think that this would sort of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7013.166s">[Ruseau]</a>: put a bow on giving her access to personnel information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7018.087s">[Ruseau]</a>: I do wonder about access to student information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7024.129s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I don't know the legal stuff that allows, what the laws are that give, for instance, all of our staff access to student information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7033.932s">[Ruseau]</a>: But for instance, school committee members do not have access to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7036.993s">[Ruseau]</a>: The mayor doesn't have access to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7040.632s">[Ruseau]</a>: And nobody in City Hall has access to student information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7043.913s">[Ruseau]</a>: So how we would consider that aspect of student privacy I think has to be a part of the conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7054.215s">[Ruseau]</a>: And being on the other side of the wall of student information as a school committee member, the answer is you get none.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7063.456s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm very unaware of how<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7066.457s">[Ruseau]</a>: that is managed within the school system already to make sure that only the right people have access to student information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7073.422s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that is a concern I have as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7077.005s">[Ruseau]</a>: So that's all I wanted to say.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7078.966s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7438.928s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7439.389s">[Ruseau]</a>: I guess I'm not particularly enjoying the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7444.941s">[Ruseau]</a>: on not veiled threat that tomorrow the work stops if we don't pass this, because that's what it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7451.862s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would just say we've never authorized this work in the first place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7455.443s">[Ruseau]</a>: So we put the cart before the horse here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7460.144s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that wasn't my decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7463.105s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so as a committee member, I'm going to second the motion to send it to subcommittee and not support this until we've had a chance to actually discuss it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7470.026s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7541.905s">[Ruseau]</a>: Do you mean, are you trying to suggest that we skip voting on the amendment before we vote on the motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7554.115s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, there's been an amendment offered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7555.917s">[Ruseau]</a>: We vote on an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=7557.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: That's how it's supposed to work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8038.64s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8040.868s">[Ruseau]</a>: I would certainly second the motion to approve this through December 31st of 2024.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8048.195s">[Ruseau]</a>: And there's no reason we can't just do this with $7,500 annualized through that time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8056.022s">[Ruseau]</a>: But whatever the, what was the number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8059.965s">[Ruseau]</a>: Well, I mean, honestly, we should just start with July 1.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8065.74s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, I mean, that's my recommendation is, so $3,750 through the December 31 date.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8077.224s">[Ruseau]</a>: And if that's okay with Member Ntapa to amend that, and then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8085.323s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, so the motion I'm making is to approve 2024-40 through the end of December, through December 31st, 2024, with a compensation of 3,750 for July 1 to December 31.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8092.867s">[Ruseau]</a>: So 7,500, but only for that short time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8094.107s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes, that's great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8095.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8118.373s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8119.774s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think this is just a different motion, actually.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8133.403s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8164.096s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion for approval by... Can I read it one more time, Mayor, the whole thing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8172.819s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion is to approve 2024-40 to temporarily authorize the work of the city DEI director through December 31st, 2024 at $3,750 and for work spanning July.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8192.479s">[Ruseau]</a>: One 2024 through December 31st.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8197.082s">[Ruseau]</a>: There's 2024 and send the proposed resolution to the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Subcommittee for review and consideration with the recommendations returned to the full committee by December 16th, 2024 meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8212.172s">[Ruseau]</a>: And that was first motioned by a member in Tapa and seconded by me, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8232.605s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Bramley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8240.551s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8244.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8246.895s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntabu.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8248.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8249.136s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8251.246s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeld?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8253.448s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rosselli?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8254.108s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8254.388s">[Ruseau]</a>: Mayor Landau?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8330.029s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Bramley?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8331.49s">[Ruseau]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8332.45s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Graham?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8334.372s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Ntapa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8336.433s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Olopade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8338.555s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rheinfeldt?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/v5KM3TWS1RE&t=8340.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: Members so yes Marilyn co care.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5735.25s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5738.132s">[Ruseau]</a>: Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5739.253s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5740.073s">[Ruseau]</a>: I appreciate the endless work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5744.657s">[Ruseau]</a>: I realize it's your job too, so of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5746.178s">[Ruseau]</a>: I obviously think that what's going on in the programs is very important, but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5755.686s">[Ruseau]</a>: Could you describe for me, for all of us, what happens if you don't have the required number of staff for students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5764.933s">[Ruseau]</a>: Let's say that there's, how many people are typically with a group of students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5780.825s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, you know, let's say that, you know, you're way under the ratios people called in sick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5787.561s">[Ruseau]</a>: You don't have a substitute pool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5790.663s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not that anybody else does for any other area except for, well anyways.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5796.468s">[Ruseau]</a>: And what happens in the district when you are not going to have enough people to be with the kids?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5996.716s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=5997.236s">[Ruseau]</a>: I certainly wouldn't have suggested it was anything but thoughtful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6001.477s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, when the director has to fill in, the director's not doing your other job, which is continuous recruitment, program evaluation and development and all that other stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6016.061s">[Ruseau]</a>: And so when I think about us adding, most school committee members have heard, why don't we just hire tough students or even high school kids or young adults,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6029.798s">[Ruseau]</a>: what is right where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6031.7s">[Ruseau]</a>: And and the answer is, we can't just not have anybody there because they you know, the sports teams is a really good example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6039.225s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, if we use them for our ratios, well, they're gonna go get on a bus and go somewhere to play a game.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6045.23s">[Ruseau]</a>: And can't just have the kids in the room without some adults.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6050.994s">[Ruseau]</a>: And what you know, we don't we don't want to end up with the director and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6054.878s">[Ruseau]</a>: you know, to assistant superintendents and the superintendent and everybody just like having to do after school programming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6063.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: But if we keep increasing it and we are dependent on people that are not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6071.676s">[Ruseau]</a>: Not that they're not reliable people, but their schedule makes it so that they are not going to be a reliable body to be with the students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6078.997s">[Ruseau]</a>: I just get very concerned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6080.998s">[Ruseau]</a>: It's always the solution I keep hearing about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6084.158s">[Ruseau]</a>: Students, in any capacity, I mean, college gets out before public schools do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6091.4s">[Ruseau]</a>: My memory is that winter break for colleges is a lot longer than it is for public schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6100.208s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm not saying we shouldn't use them for the way you are using them now, because I think the activities and that all sounds great, but that doesn't solve our capacity problem in my mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6112.357s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I just wanted to make that point because we can't be paying you to be filling in as an on the ground person.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6127.731s">[Ruseau]</a>: and also expect you to continue doing your regular job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=6130.313s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9044.262s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9046.873s">[Ruseau]</a>: I'm perfectly comfortable, I mean, with us discussing the timeline from our policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9053.779s">[Ruseau]</a>: This is the first year with the policy, so I think we all kind of assumed it would not work exactly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9062.426s">[Ruseau]</a>: The one thing, though, is that part of the policy is to align with the capital improvement plan<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9074.298s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I'm trying to just dig into it really quickly right now, because one of the challenges we had was that we had a date that we needed to make sure aligned with the city's budget ordinance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9087.788s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I can't tell necessarily from this document whether we're going to blow past their date, because those conversations were back in June, and frankly, it feels like five years ago already.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9104.116s">[Ruseau]</a>: I think we do, I can go and back and try and figure out what after look at the minutes but there was an important date here that required a lot of pushing things earlier than I think even we had initially thought we wanted, because we knew this is a very aggressive timeline change.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9123.666s">[Ruseau]</a>: the budget ordinance has a date, which I don't have in front of me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9127.65s">[Ruseau]</a>: And we don't want to miss that because then it makes that a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9133.496s">[Ruseau]</a>: But I'm not giving you enough information to go on right this second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9136.599s">[Ruseau]</a>: So I will take that as something to do to go back and find that information so that we can see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9145.206s">[Ruseau]</a>: I mean, the city's budget ordinance is also new.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9148.348s">[Ruseau]</a>: So if it's impossible for us to meet their deadline, then I think that that's a conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9158.174s">[Ruseau]</a>: that we could have with the council, but I just wanted to point that out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9500.462s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9507.808s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sure, Member Rousseau.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9510.189s">[Ruseau]</a>: I believe this is, our attorney does not feel like this is actually something we can approve at this time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9517.264s">[Ruseau]</a>: And I could be wrong, I take the table back.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9520.706s">[Ruseau]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9628.112s">[Ruseau]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9628.612s">[Ruseau]</a>: So is our attorney still being asked to sign something for which he does not think he certainly does not feel comfortable signing at this point?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9638.419s">[Ruseau]</a>: Or is that not based on this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9646.785s">[Ruseau]</a>: And this will not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9648.544s">[Ruseau]</a>: put him in a place where he has no options?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9651.405s">[Ruseau]</a>: Okay, then I withdraw my table, which I think I already did that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9656.807s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=9657.747s">[Ruseau]</a>: Motion to second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ucoZOAdkTf4&t=10113.628s">[Ruseau]</a>: So, can we just say we're approving as consolidated I wrote the language but you're not going to make me read it are you motion to approve as consolidated.<br><br>
