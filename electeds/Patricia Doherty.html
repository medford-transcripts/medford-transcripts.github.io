 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5335.4s">Patricia</a> Brady, Dougherty, 190 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5338.201s">I</a> turned this on to watch what was going to happen to the rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5342.043s">Instead,</a> I'm watching this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5344.324s">It's</a> so horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5345.264s">This</a> is horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5347.202s">To</a> think that you have put longtime senior citizen residents, actually of all ages, at risk, and to think they feel the need to come up and say to you, I'm afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5358.808s">For</a> Barbara Rutstein to have to come up here and tell you that is horrifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5363.851s">This</a> is so embarrassing for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5368.094s">You</a> shouldn't be laying this on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5370.455s">You</a> shouldn't be continuing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5374.08s">You</a> should be having a motion tonight to end it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5379.484s">You</a> people ought to be embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=5382.226s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7509.272s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7510.172s">I'd</a> like to address this through the chair to the prior speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7514.915s">You</a> don't have to be Jewish to care and hear the sadness and how frightened these people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7523.02s">This</a> resolution cannot affect what happens in the Middle East. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7527.042s">In</a> fact, it really doesn't even have a place on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7531.428s">I'm</a> Catholic, but tonight I'm Jewish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7534.369s">I</a> feel for these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7535.91s">This</a> is such a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ig6AP1vJ1-8&t=7537.61s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-03_ZkVvlwQNw_U/2025-07-03_ZkVvlwQNw_U.html">Community Development Board 06-25-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9181.516s">Hi,</a> this is Patricia Doherty. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9182.976s">I</a> have a question for you about something you were just referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9188.718s">On</a> Harvard Ave, you said there were three homes there that were home-like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9193.9s">What</a> did you mean by that?
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9212.261s">So</a> why then would you think that they are not homes?
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9226.165s">I</a> don't mean that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9226.845s">That's</a> a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9228.386s">And</a> it abuts St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9229.466s">Raphael's.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9230.026s">And</a> St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9230.386s">Raphael's</a> does not own a lot of property there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9232.967s">They</a> have a rectory that looks like a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9235.488s">And</a> they have a convent, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9241.412s">maybe</a> two and a half stories of a beige color brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9246.354s">And</a> then the rest of those homes are older Victorian single family homes, well kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9254.277s">And</a> I think the residents would be horrified to find out that all of a sudden they could be in a <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9263.004s">higher</a> density neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9264.885s">I</a> don't think anyone wants to find out that they can have three or five stories built next to their lovely Victorian, particularly the one that, I forget her name, Miss McDonald, I think it was mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9278.534s">That</a> is what's setting Medford on edge right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9281.635s">These</a> boundaries are blurring into residential neighborhoods and no one's paying attention to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZkVvlwQNw_U&t=9289.04s">That's</a> my comment, thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_kOuBy-MtMpc/2025-06-26_kOuBy-MtMpc.html">Community Development Board 01-22-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9209.765s">Hi,</a> Patricia Brady Doherty, 190 West Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9214.288s">I'm</a> a former Medford City Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9216.089s">I</a> spent eight years on the council, and a majority of that was working on zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9221.472s">Even</a> though I'm an attorney, it's such a nuanced field. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9226.115s">I</a> hired a Boston zoning attorney to walk me through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9231.418s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9232.657s">I</a> think a lot of these people feel like they need to do that, and some of them, as you may have heard earlier, have done just that, and they should not have to be put through that expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9242.741s">But</a> what I'm hearing tonight is that no one's protecting the neighborhoods, and the overwhelming majority of these people have come forward to say they are scared, they're nervous, and they don't like what they see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9258.084s">It</a> used to be that the city council had one motto and that was protect the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9263.388s">What</a> I hear from this city council is, and maybe from the mayor and hopefully not, let's protect the developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9272.454s">The</a> only thing I think that you people can do tonight is take this off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9276.798s">It's</a> impossible to fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9278.819s">It</a> is so overwhelming. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9280.26s">It</a> is so high. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9281.541s">It</a> is so dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9282.742s">You</a> are going to ruin the neighborhoods and that should not happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9288.375s">So</a> I ask you to think very, very carefully about what you're doing and to consider who you're representing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9294.357s">You're</a> representing the residents of the neighborhood, nobody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9298.679s">You're</a> not representing the OCD board or the mayor or the city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/kOuBy-MtMpc&t=9304.021s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1328.294s">Hi,</a> Patricia Daugherty, 235 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1331.396s">I'm</a> so glad to see this on the agenda tonight because you may or may not know that since the day after the election, there have been a lot of issues about getting information from the city clerk's office and from the register of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1347.443s">Did</a> any of you know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1350.861s">Well,</a> normally before the election, campaigns can come and get information freely from the city clerk's office or the register of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1360.726s">And</a> usually after the election, a volunteer will go in and ask for the voter activity list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1368.17s">And</a> so after the September 2nd preliminary, we have got the voter activity list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1375.694s">And</a> that list is important because it'll allow you to fine tune <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1381.03s">the</a> list you'll use in the next mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1383.492s">It</a> tells you who voted, who didn't vote, what parties voted.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1394.0s">No,</a> I'm saying as volunteers, as like a volunteer.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1401.405s">No,</a> I went in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1402.206s">I</a> went in because I had volunteered on several campaigns this fall.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1407.05s">But</a> at this moment, I'm speaking as me who went in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1410.895s">So</a> I went in to get, so the day after the November 2nd election, I went in to get the numbers, the unofficial official numbers, and knowing that they are not official until of course they're certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1425.639s">And</a> I also asked if I could then, when would the voter activity list for November 2nd be ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1431.321s">Usually</a> that's a week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1432.381s">And</a> so they gave a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1436.582s">But</a> I also heard when I was down there, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1439.441s">that</a> a list of 12,546 people had been moved from active to inactive back to active again before the preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1455.431s">Now,</a> were you people aware of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1462.476s">Through</a> the chair, Councilor Marks, you were aware of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1465.478s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1469.58s">called</a> the Secretary of State's office and Michelle Tassinieri got back to me and she's chief legal counsel, as many of you might know, and she explained what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1480.37s">She</a> said that the city clerk's office had moved 12,546 people to inactive status and <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1493.187s">then</a> it, but it was done too close to the next election. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1497.188s">So,</a> and I can't remember whether she said notices were sent out or not sent out because what happens is the city does their annual street listing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1505.09s">And</a> if you don't respond, you then are removed from the active photo list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1510.911s">And,</a> but before they do that, they send a card out to remind you that you didn't fill out your street census. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1517.593s">And</a> so when I was talking to her, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1520.088s">She</a> said, but it was too close to the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1522.369s">Someone</a> had filed a complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1524.269s">And</a> I said, well, how would they know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1526.53s">How</a> would they know that there was anything to complain about? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1530.431s">And</a> she said, well, I'm not sure you'd have to find that out from the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1534.812s">So,</a> but the other thing I asked her about is I said, there are 41,000 people registered to vote in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1540.634s">And</a> the census says we only have 59,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1543.995s">Doesn't</a> that seem very high to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1545.395s">And</a> she said, it seems really high. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1547.756s">And</a> she said, why don't you go back <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1549.621s">take</a> out, go to the recent census and take out all the kids, everyone under 18 who can't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1556.364s">And</a> then if you come up with a really high number, then go to your council, go to the registrar's office and suggest that maybe there needs to be some sort of deeper review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1565.868s">So</a> I did what she said, and we came up with a really high number. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1571.01s">And</a> just to make sure it wasn't off base, I took Wellesley, which I knew to be a very high, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1579.81s">owner</a> occupied city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1581.711s">And</a> I knew they had very high public participation because they have hundreds of people show up at their town meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1587.752s">And</a> then I thought, well, this is kind of extreme. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1589.633s">I'll</a> just go next door to Winchester, the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1592.174s">And</a> so both Wellesley and Winchester have an 80% of their population is registered to vote and they have 90%, give or take, owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1601.916s">So</a> you would expect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1604.697s">Well,</a> Medford has 85% of our <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1608.9s">population</a> registered to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1611.762s">And</a> that is extremely high because we're only at 56% owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1617.586s">So</a> I'm suggesting that there might want to be some investigation into why our we have such a high number registered to vote in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1627.912s">But</a> the other thing is I said to her, well, if <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1632.523s">We</a> were going to delete 12,546 people from the list that would leave 29,000 people registered to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1640.228s">Listen,</a> that seemed like a really high number to delete and she said it is a really high number, she said you need to ask maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1647.338s">the</a> city clerk wasn't deleting the list, cleaning up the list every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1650.439s">You</a> know, maybe you go back seven or eight years and they hadn't cleaned up the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1654.141s">And</a> I thought, well, that was unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1655.641s">That</a> would be not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1656.962s">Well,</a> I happened to run into Ed Finn outside one day and he said, no, we cleaned up the list every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1662.084s">And</a> he said, I think Adam has been doing it also. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1664.525s">So</a> I think another question we have to ask is how did we get to 12,546 people on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1668.346s">Maybe</a> that's part of the review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1673.902s">Well,</a> there were a couple more questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1676.124s">So</a> anyway, I waited the week and I walked back into city clerk's office to see if the voter activity list was ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1684.19s">And</a> I was told, we can't talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1686.933s">I</a> said, me or everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1689.174s">We</a> can't talk to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1690.095s">And</a> I said, what do you mean you can't talk to anyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1693.097s">We</a> can't give out any lists, we can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1695.019s">I</a> said, what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1698.642s">I</a> was told we could committing, you have the voter activity list, why can't I have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1703.98s">And</a> they said, we just can't tell you anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1706.902s">I</a> thought, this is really weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1708.844s">Like</a> normally you only shut down the flow of communication when there's a criminal investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1713.208s">I</a> said, is there a criminal investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1714.729s">They</a> said, we can't talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1716.751s">So</a> I went down the register of voters office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1718.392s">This</a> is Wednesday, November 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1723.196s">And</a> I said, Sandy Gill was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1725.057s">And</a> I said, could I get the list I talked about with you last week? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1729.441s">And</a> she said, I'm sorry, we can't talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1733.198s">And</a> I said, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1735.86s">And</a> no one would look up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1737.581s">Everyone</a> was really nervous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1739.562s">And</a> it was the weirdest state of affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1741.123s">So</a> I went home, called up seeing Michelle Tassineri again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1744.965s">And</a> she called me back later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1748.928s">And</a> someone said, we can't talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1751.41s">The</a> Secretary of State's office said we can't talk to anyone right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1755.332s">Oh,</a> I forgot one important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1756.533s">So</a> I went upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1757.433s">They</a> said, you got to go to the city solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1759.154s">So</a> I went there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1760.528s">And</a> she was too busy to talk to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1761.889s">They</a> said, you have to file a freedom of information to get this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1765.652s">I</a> said, this is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1767.493s">I</a> said, we just got the exact same list like in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1771.496s">So</a> I went to the mayor's office and there was a meeting going on and I got to go in and I said, can you please tell me under what authority are you shutting down the flow of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1782.164s">Is</a> there a criminal investigation going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1785.402s">And</a> the mayor didn't answer me.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1812.75s">That</a> is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1815.533s">That's</a> a very factual statement I made because that's what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1819.377s">I</a> said, how are you shutting down the flow of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1821.759s">Is</a> there a criminal investigation going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1823.461s">Because</a> normally that's the only time you would shut down the flow of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1827.125s">And</a> I was told by the chief of staff answered me, not the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1830.868s">And</a> she said, you have to go through the city solicitor and file a FOIA.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1858.155s">So</a> Mr. President, to continue, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1861.6s">Michelle</a> Tassinari legal counsel for the Secretary of State's office called me back that afternoon around 430. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1868.144s">And</a> she was very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1869.765s">And</a> she said, I not only called city clerk's office, city hall, she said, I emailed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1876.91s">And</a> I told them under no circumstances are they to use our office as the authority in shutting down information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1884.134s">She</a> said, I don't know why they're doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1885.655s">It's</a> extremely unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1887.376s">She</a> said, but in order for you to get information, you'll have to file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1893.215s">The</a> next day was Veterans Day, the office was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1895.617s">I</a> went Friday and filed eight or nine requests for the information that is normally given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1902.4s">So</a> the questions I'd like to know is, you people hire and fire the city clerk, did you give the order to shut down the information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1910.825s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1916.107s">So,</a> but the most important question now is, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1922.896s">What</a> is the background on the 12,546 names? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1927.219s">Did</a> you have that information before either the preliminary or the election? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1932.783s">That</a> there was this list that went from active to inactive to active?
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1946.412s">Well,</a> through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1949.137s">Secretary,</a> Michelle Tosineri said that, that is something that was, so it was a major mistake, but it was a major mistake that should have been brought to the attention of the administration in the city, both council president and the mayor, because it was, it meant that nobody had to go to a voting, to the precincts and show <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1976.922s">a</a> license and or sign an affirmation that they lived where they say they lived and they had lived there January 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1985.612s">And</a> so did any of you, Councilor Bears, Councilor Knight, the Councilors over here, did you people know that there was this information of 12,546 names out there?
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2011.708s">It's</a> the city clerk's office.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2014.929s">Yes,</a> but the city clerk is the city clerk that was the one that was told.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2025.992s">I'm</a> not suggesting any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2027.252s">I'm</a> asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2028.193s">I</a> have questions to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2029.698s">So</a> what Michelle Tosineri, legal counsel, she said these questions should be answered by city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2039.342s">Now,</a> I said the city council hires and fires the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2042.924s">I</a> don't know what the city clerk knew or didn't know, but she did tell me that he, she had him put the list back, the active that he put on inactive, she had him put it back to active because it was within a timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2057.08s">And</a> she said a citizen had called in to complain to the Secretary of State's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2061.327s">And</a> my question to her as well how would anyone know to even call in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2067.048s">And</a> to do that, like in the different campaigns that people were out there, they didn't have this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2073.133s">And</a> if you knew the list existed or the information existed, it would be something that you would wanna get just like the way you go in and get the voter activity list from September 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2082.381s">All</a> right, well, I just have the questions I'd like answered is who gave the authority in city hall and under what authority did they have to shut down the information?
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2103.0s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2105.16s">And</a> then, but, but I don't so as of today we still, I do know that one person who requested the information did get was sent had the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2116.772s">I</a> have not been sent the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2118.213s">And</a> now I know that city clerk's office, they have COVID and maybe they're all out sick with it and they can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2122.896s">Maybe</a> that's the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2124.337s">But</a> it is very discouraging to know that anything that you normally would get, you cannot get right now.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2136.544s">Well,</a> through the chair, never ever has it been known that anyone goes to the city solicitor's office to ask for the active voting list of any election. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2145.813s">for</a> the registered voters, you go to the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2149.798s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2183.435s">Michelle</a> was kind enough on the 10th to let me know that the deadline for <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2190.608s">Any</a> campaign that I may be volunteering for, the recall deadline to file the papers was Friday the 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2200.275s">But</a> she said, don't forget there's section, Mass General Law 54, section 134, which is once an election is certified, you can contest it for 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2211.883s">So</a> it isn't as though everything's hunky-dory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2214.385s">We</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2215.306s">There's</a> just a lot of questions and we don't have the answers.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4/2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4.html">City Council 05-18-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5528.804s">Patricia</a> Brady Darty, 235 Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5533.807s">The</a> people here tonight aren't so much here to ask you to do something, although some individuals may have said that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5543.353s">They</a> are here because they're extremely upset about the comments made by the individual, actually written on, I think, Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5553.519s">I</a> saw a screenshot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5556.401s">denigrating</a> the Italians who took the time to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5560.364s">And</a> he said that they all voted for Gene Barry and they cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5564.828s">We</a> forgot that important point. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5567.11s">In</a> print, he wrote, and they cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5570.092s">Well,</a> you know, then the other thing he said, which was said earlier, he wasn't sure that Gene Barry had not treated black children badly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5583.183s">Now</a> that's the equivalent of saying when was the last time <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5586.722s">When</a> did you stop beating your wife? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5589.623s">Those</a> are disgusting statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5591.923s">These</a> people understand that you can't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5596.724s">But</a> as Councilor Mark so eloquently said, this is the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5603.606s">I</a> learned that from serving with Councilor Mayocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5607.386s">He</a> said it over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5610.187s">It's</a> the only public forum in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5614.268s">How</a> did we get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5616.034s">How</a> did we get to this point from a great city of 58,000 people who have a reputation of racial harmony to the point where we're here because people who are on city commissions say the flag represents rape and pillage and that people that the Italians <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5641.299s">voted</a> on, and maybe they did, and maybe they didn't, cheated, and that the person that they voted for may have mistreated black children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5649.542s">How</a> did we get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5654.124s">This</a> is a city that in 1963 elected Madeline Duggar Andrews, the first black school committee person elected in the state of Massachusetts to a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5665.869s">This</a> is a city that in 1981 put <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5670.665s">Ken</a> Holmes on the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5674.666s">That's</a> not the mark of a racist city and we're sick and tired of hearing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5679.347s">So</a> how did we get there? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5680.807s">Well,</a> it started when the mayor decided we're a racist city and there was a proclamation that we are racist and it's a health crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5689.089s">No,</a> we're not a racist city and we're sick of hearing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5698.072s">So</a> what happened in the past year and a half <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5701.132s">and</a> I'll just do the topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5702.412s">You</a> all probably know what happened with the subheadings are. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5706.233s">After</a> that, the Columbus school name changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5711.654s">Then</a> we had the July 4th incident at Exchange Ave where over 200 people threw rockets and firecrackers at the police and they had to call in the state police <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5724.935s">and</a> the firefight is to help defend them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5727.437s">And</a> how did that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5728.758s">Because</a> people had been marching through the streets of Medford, calling the police names and saying, defund the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5737.506s">So</a> then we had the rally here on the steps, as you all know, and at the end of the rally, very peaceful, loving rally, a group of teenagers who were holding Black Lives Matter signs very quietly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5751.425s">crossed</a> the parking lot, stood on the steps, and were yelling, F the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5757.387s">They</a> chanted it for several minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5759.108s">We</a> have it on videotape. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5760.528s">There's</a> no making that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5764.87s">And</a> then, two days later, the people at the rally and the organizers were condemned. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5771.773s">And</a> not one, were condemned by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5776.134s">And</a> that gave ammunition <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5778.608s">for</a> people to start the Racist of Medford website. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5782.87s">I'm</a> on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5783.95s">You</a> know why it says I'm a racist? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5785.551s">Because</a> I supported the rally. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5787.252s">I</a> was an organizer for the rally. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5789.893s">Now,</a> I've been a public figure, so people can call me whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5794.895s">They</a> can call me a slut, it doesn't make me one. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5797.976s">But</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5798.797s">There</a> are people on that, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5804.857s">site</a> who never in their lives had their name in public print. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5810.359s">And</a> they were devastated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5813.68s">And</a> no one in public office in this city came forward and condemned it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5821.182s">Then</a> we have racial sensitivity courses at the high school that the teachers had to take this winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5828.204s">Talking</a> about white privilege, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5830.673s">and</a> how the fact that if you're white, you automatically do not like minorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5836.255s">It's</a> a version of the race theory, critical race theory, that's condemned by many states across this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5846.878s">Now,</a> we don't have white privilege, and we're really sick and tired of people telling us we're racist when we don't see color. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5855.781s">Then</a> we run into, <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5857.785s">The</a> flag where a commissioner felt it was okay to get up last month in an official meeting and say, the flag represents rape and pillage to certain people. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5870.396s">And</a> the mayor shouldn't appear next to the flag in a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5873.999s">And</a> then we end up last week finding out that the city's asking the state to waive veterans preference when they hired the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5888.167s">And</a> now we're here because someone on a committee empowered to vote for the name change says the Italians cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5901.352s">I</a> would suggest that's how we got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5903.513s">That</a> whole 18 months and no one's standing up for us, but ourselves in the background. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5910.736s">Well,</a> we're here to tell you we're not gonna stand for it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5920.128s">We</a> are all Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5923.731s">We</a> are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5924.431s">We're</a> gonna stand in the breach and we're gonna work as a community, as Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5932.658s">And</a> we happen to believe what Martin Luther King said, which is he didn't want his children judged by the color of their skin. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5942.606s">He</a> wanted them judged by the content of their character. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5947.33s">And</a> we do have something for you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5950.328s">We</a> hope that you will take the lead and stop this madness. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5955.715s">Please</a> emulate Martin Luther King and speak up for us and stand with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5961.943s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8158.25s">I</a> didn't say that.

 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8220.838s">Through</a> the chair, I can tell you what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8223.72s">This</a> is about the fact that we are sick and tired of listening to people <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8230.458s">who</a> haven't experienced half of what most of this people in this room have due to their age or their inexperience. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8237.421s">I</a> happen to have had the great privilege to have lived for 30 years in Judge Brooks's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8242.804s">We</a> bought the house from his estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8245.205s">He</a> marched in Selma in his 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8249.147s">That's</a> the type of people we come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8253.367s">And</a> so what's tonight about? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8255.309s">We</a> finally got sick and tired when we found out that this person on the committee put these statements in writing that the Italians cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8266.859s">That's</a> what this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8268.341s">We</a> want to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8270.543s">We</a> know maybe you can't do a whole lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8272.404s">I</a> have a suggestion for something you could do if you wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8276.867s">Councilor</a> Mayorko told me that four votes of this city council could put an advisory question on the ballot in November, asking if we want the name change. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8287.211s">Yes,</a> it may be too late, but at least people would feel like they've been heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8292.093s">Now</a> that's your druthers whether you wanna do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8294.514s">So</a> what are we doing here today? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8296.075s">We're</a> saying we're sick and tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8298.175s">We're</a> not gonna sit here when someone says that Jean Barry maybe mistreated black children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8302.757s">We're</a> not gonna sit here when the Italians <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8305.356s">when</a> a man wrote on that committee that the Italians cheated. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8309.997s">Nope,</a> we're done, we're sick of it, and we're gonna come back here every night if we have to on Tuesday nights.

 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5703.67s">I</a> want to give you your turn to speak.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5708.373s">Only</a> as a favor to you, Adam.
 <p>[Patricia Doherty]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5718.259s">It</a> appears that no one at the Human Rights Commission meeting spoke up to defend the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5723.883s">However,</a> one person did step forward on social media, but I will speak to that in a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5731.355s">There</a> are thousands of veterans in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5734.055s">There</a> are hundreds of people in this community who have shed their blood and died on the battlefield in defense of their flag, our flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5742.617s">Every</a> person who's into the military takes this oath, takes their oath in front of the American flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5749.878s">Every</a> morning, the army awakes to the rising of the flag, the raising of the flag with revelry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5756.359s">And</a> when the day is done, the flag is lowered when the evening gun is fired in a solemn ceremony. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5762.836s">An</a> American soldier wears the flag on his sleeve. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5766.658s">If</a> a soldier dies in combat, he comes home in a flag-draped coffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5771.219s">When</a> a soldier is buried with full military honors, the last thing that happens is that the flag is folded, presented to family with the words, by a grateful nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5783.564s">A</a> soldier does not allow the flag to touch the ground, and when the flag is worn out, it's burned and its ashes buried. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5792.415s">Between</a> World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq, almost a million and a half Americans lost their lives overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5804.661s">We</a> do not speak German or Japanese as a captive people because of these veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5810.943s">We</a> decorate our veterans' graves on Oak Grove with flags for Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5815.345s">This</a> weekend and next, veterans will place 8,700 flags on graves for the upcoming Memorial Day holiday on May 31st, when the city will honor the men and women who died while serving their country. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5831.448s">Veterans</a> look to this flag as a symbol of this great country, the lives lost and the freedoms won. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5838.709s">Veterans</a> are bonded to the flag as are most Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5845.23s">We</a> say the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag as school children, the city council and the school committee starts its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance as do people at baseball games and other sporting events. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5856.576s">It</a> is who we are as an American people. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5860.718s">If</a> this statement regarding the flag were made in a private conversation, then I would fully support the commission members right to say this no matter how offensive it is to veterans and other citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5874.272s">However,</a> this person was serving in an official capacity as representative of the city of Medford when she made the statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5882.839s">All</a> people who are elected officials and appointed members of boards and commission in this city take an oath to uphold the constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5891.906s">The</a> constitution is the basis of the country and the flag is a symbol of our country here and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5900.873s">The</a> statement regarding the flag <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5904.724s">made</a> by the Human Rights Commission member calls into question her ability to faithfully execute her duties impartially as an appointed member in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5917.351s">For</a> instance, would she treat a veteran fairly or unfairly if he or she appeared before the commission wearing a hat with a flag on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5929.657s">And</a> speaking of veterans, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5931.279s">This</a> week, veteran organizations in the city learned that the city is seeking a waiver from the state to override the law requiring veterans preference when hiring new police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5944.485s">Again,</a> another insult to veterans is that veterans do not matter in this city any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5950.687s">As</a> mentioned earlier, one Medford resident expressed his anger on social media <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5961.074s">about</a> the statement made by the Human Rights Commission member disrespecting the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5965.517s">He</a> titled his post defending the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5968.539s">Although</a> I do not condone some of the language he chose to use in his post, nevertheless, he has a constitutional right of free speech as we all do express his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5979.486s">However,</a> in response to this post, the Human Rights Commission called an emergency meeting, essentially to attack this resident expressing an opinion they do not like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5990.811s">During</a> this emergency Zoom meeting, the Human Rights Commission members, including the mayor's liaison, the director of diversity, two city Councilors, a school committee member, including members of the public, proceeded to vilify this resident, simply because he had expressed his criticism of the statement attacking the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6014.22s">They</a> called him a racist, a misogynist, and a deviant, all under the pretext <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6020.095s">of</a> a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6023.658s">One</a> woman even asked the chief of police who was present if they could visit this person, if they could investigate him, if they could intimidate him. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6037.168s">That</a> sounds like someone advocating KGB action, like in a police state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6044.754s">And</a> not one person present objected to that statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6050.052s">Again,</a> all of this vitriol is directed an individual simply because he exercised his constitutional right to free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6061.379s">Is</a> it not height of hypocrisy for commission members, elected officials and others to condemn this resident for exercising his first amendment right to free speech while at the same time claiming the commission member, the original statement to spreading the flag was a proper exercise of free speech? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6080.92s">Thank</a> you.
