 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1702.447s">Testing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1703.047s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1705.742s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1706.662s">My</a> name is Miranda Berseno. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1708.463s">I</a> love calling Medford home, and I'm running for City Council to make sure that City Hall delivers better for residents of all ages, wages, and backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1717.744s">We</a> deserve a Medford that invests robustly in the public places that keep us connected to each other, like our schools, parks, and library. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1725.366s">We</a> deserve a library that is open seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1727.986s">We</a> deserve a Medford with plenty of shade trees and green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1732.175s">As</a> a renter, I felt firsthand how hard it is to afford to remain here amid the skyrocketing cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1737.837s">We</a> all deserve a more affordable Medford, where elders can age in place and where new and long-time residents alike can put down roots without fear of displacement due to rising rents and home prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1749.68s">Medford</a> students and families deserve thriving public schools and expanded after-school and pre-K. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1755.161s">Our</a> school staff deserves competitive pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1757.942s">I</a> will fight for a budget that allows us to meet these goals every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1762.178s">In</a> addition, I proudly support building a new flagship Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1767.479s">We</a> deserve a Medford that invests in keeping all of our neighbors safe through an unarmed mental health crisis response team, continued noncompliance with ICE, and better social services for our neighbors in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1779.623s">Safety</a> also means our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1782.023s">And</a> as a transportation planner, road safety is my bread and butter. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1785.464s">In</a> the last five years, Medford has seen at least 84 crashes which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1792.28s">we</a> need to treat traffic violence like the emergency it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1796.241s">At</a> MassDOT, I work with municipalities to help them utilize transportation funding to its full potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1801.902s">I</a> work closely on funding for large capital projects and I help manage essential programs such as the Safe Routes to School program. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1808.684s">This</a> has given me a bird's eye view of the regional problems that affect us here in Medford and where the solutions lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1814.741s">As</a> your city councilor, I will make sure we strategically leverage our transportation funding to make our streets safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1821.765s">I</a> will also make sure the city completes an ADA transition plan so that everyone can participate in civic life and enjoy all that Medford has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1830.549s">But</a> before my time at MassDOT, I worked right here for Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1834.552s">I</a> spearheaded Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, which provided crucial funding to Medford's restaurants, corner stores, salons, and spas to help them survive during an unpredictable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1845.268s">I</a> developed the city's first outdoor dining program, and I helped the city improve its bus stop and blues bikes infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1852.255s">As</a> a MassDOT employee, I'm heavily involved in my union, and I currently serve on its board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1858.842s">Medford</a> runs on union power, and I'm proud to be endorsed by SEIU Local 509 and UAW Region 9A. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1866.955s">I</a> love being a part of our diverse, multi-generational, vibrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1871.22s">My</a> neighbours have always been there for me, and now I'm running for City Council to make sure the city is there for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1876.786s">I</a> look forward to meeting you and talking with you, and I hope to earn your vote this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1880.39s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council

 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7410.008s">Hi,</a> I'm Miranda Briceño. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7411.369s">I'm</a> at 2 Taylor Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7413.647s">Thank</a> you for the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7415.608s">I</a> am in favor of this ordinance, and I will tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7419.348s">Investing</a> in businesses that are helping destroy communities through violence, incarceration, or the climate crisis is a bad financial decision in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7427.61s">Reinvesting</a> in businesses that build and grow our economies is our financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7432.311s">I'm</a> eager to see my tax dollars responsibly invested in companies, projects, and banks that prioritize people over profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7439.053s">How</a> we spend our money is a statement of our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7441.734s">As</a> we exist in a capitalist system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can... <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7452.794s">As</a> we can, sorry, as we exist in a capital system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can assert our ability to refuse participation in industries that are actively harming people, our environment, and prioritizing profit over people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7466.527s">I</a> support that this ordinance recognizes the slow process that is divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7471.352s">We</a> won't be able to move our money and accounts overnight from companies that are actively causing harm across the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7476.978s">So</a> deciding to actively choose contracts and do businesses with companies that are aligned with our values as a city as a result of this ordinance is just one crucial step in putting Medford on the right side of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7487.408s">The</a> idea that this issue doesn't affect Medford is naive at best and actively ignorant at worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7492.714s">We</a> live in a globalized world whether we want to or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7495.552s">This</a> is not about politics, this is about prioritizing humanity as we watch our climate degrade, we watch multiple genocides across the world, and our neighbors unjustly incarcerated so that private prisons and war industry companies can continue to profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7509.756s">At</a> a time when the federal government clearly does not care about anyone but billionaires, companies, and arming their allies, <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7515.892s">Medford</a> must take a stand where we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7518.154s">The</a> federal government is already targeting Massachusetts and its communities, illegally so, and clearly the federal government does not care about legality, morality, or people at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7528.042s">The</a> same federal government that is spending our tax dollars to fund an armed Gestapo with no oversight, building prison camps on US soil, and further contributing to human rights violations, it is incumbent on Medford to take a stand and do what we can as a city to support people worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7543.534s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-07-14_XXXXXX00131/2025-07-14_XXXXXX00131.html">Miranda Briseño (Candidate for City Council)</a></h2>

 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=345.361s">They</a> closed when I was still at City Hall, and that was rough because I would walk to work when the weather was nice from my apartment. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=352.674s">It</a> was always nice to be like, you know, I'm not above Duncan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=355.955s">I'll,</a> I'll get Duncan any day, but it was always nice to be like, yeah, you know, I'm going to get like a nice, like a nicer bagel from the local shop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=366.297s">I</a> was so sad when they closed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=368.038s">I</a> still have a shirt. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=370.638s">Cause</a> I did get a shirt during 2020. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=371.859s">Cause</a> I was like, I love them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=375.019s">But</a> I it's exciting to hear they're going to open a coffee shop.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=403.527s">What</a> really prompted me was other people asking if I considered it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=409.273s">When</a> I realized I would be staying in Medford for a while, just because I wasn't sure if another job opportunity would take me somewhere, in 2020, I was like, well, let me develop roots here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=420.479s">And</a> I got involved, like everybody, in the summer of 2020 after George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, so many other things. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=430.585s">I</a> was like, I need to feel like, besides working at City Hall, which is great and see a lot of what you work on happening in real time, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=439.229s">I</a> needed, I wanted to feel like more connected to people because I didn't know many people living in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=444.371s">So</a> I joined Our Revolution Medford, met someone who literally lived across the street from me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=450.874s">And</a> then, you know, a couple other folks in my neighborhood. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=454.496s">And</a> since then have just been, you know, making friends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=457.097s">And</a> in 2021 is when I first started getting door knocking and canvassing, trying to elect candidates endorsed by Our Revolution Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=468.369s">just</a> really started rooting myself through that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=471.77s">Working</a> at City Hall too, I did, when, you know, as we were trying to navigate COVID, one of the first projects, Alicia Hunt, director of planning, kind of assigned me and one of, now planner, used to be intern, was using HUD funds for COVID relief business grants. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=496.096s">City</a> of Cambridge had done one and they were like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=498.44s">we</a> have a lot of CDBG, Community Development Block Grant money that we can use for this, you know, look into the details or requirements, what we would need from folks and who we can and can't offer this grant to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=512.404s">And</a> so it was kind of like being thrown in the deep end, but very much with like the comfort of knowing that, you know, Alicia, the mayor and other folks were there to support us. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=522.666s">But</a> that really, I'd say that work in particular, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=526.372s">That,</a> plus I also worked on outdoor dining, really just like kind of spread my knowledge wide of the city, particularly like business owners, and like the kind of businesses that people were needing relief for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=538.581s">A</a> lot of it was like our corner stores and convenience stores, like they just needed help making rent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=546.427s">And</a> a lot of our restaurants as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=548.589s">I</a> mean, the biggest thing I would say we helped pay for was rent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=553.652s">Rent</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=554.783s">for</a> businesses that were like operating in the homes, it was like Zoom memberships, stuff to make them available online and sort of start to digitize and like dip into e-commerce if they weren't already. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=568.615s">And</a> so I think that and my involvement in the community with ORM and other stuff kind of just really organically got me knowing more about Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=579.967s">and</a> just getting really involved. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=581.608s">And</a> even as I started, I changed jobs a couple of times since working at City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=587.269s">It's</a> still always been like, I love being in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=589.87s">I</a> love the people that I've met here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=593.731s">My</a> apartment isn't like the most affordable, but it's not insane. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=597.413s">You</a> know, I can continue to keep affording it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=601.314s">And</a> so, yeah, I've just been involved and then I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=605.327s">this</a> last or this upcoming election was talking with a friend who had has been involved with the ORM, like coordinated campaigns previously, and had asked, is this something you'd consider, you're qualified for it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=623.92s">And</a> I still do often have the imposter syndrome of like, am I qualified? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=629.667s">then</a> I list out the things that I've done and what I went to school for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=633.648s">Oh</a> yeah, yeah, yeah, I am. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=637.01s">And</a> I think part of it is just like, I'm pretty, I'm an introverted, extroverted introvert, I'd say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=645.153s">So</a> part of it is really just like exposure therapy and like getting to know people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=649.954s">I</a> do really thrive much more in one-on-one situations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=653.676s">And</a> so when I've canvassed before in 2021, 2023, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=658.092s">like</a> those conversations at the doors are like, they seem intimidating, but they're actually very fruitful and I really enjoy them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=666.499s">And</a> plus I like walking around anyway. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=668.18s">So</a> that was part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=670.662s">I</a> think part of it's like, I am lucky enough to have job security. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=676.106s">I'm</a> lucky enough to have, despite, you know, my own like struggles in my life, I did, you know, still kind of got a lucky card out of it all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=687.782s">And</a> if I have this privilege and like some level of comfort in my life, I do kind of sort of view, I don't want to say like my calling or kind of view it as like, I want to make this world better for people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=704.287s">And</a> if I can like offer myself and offer what I know, particularly when it comes to something like being a city Councilor or even just working at city hall, I think something that's always kind of come <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=717.728s">through</a> in my work professionally, in particular, has been let me help you understand this really bureaucratic, nuanced thing that can help you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=727.454s">A</a> lot of the times it doesn't need to be that nuanced or bureaucratic, it just kind of is because, well, historically, these processes and institutions were made to exclude people systematically, and so helping <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=743.92s">sort</a> of kind of like that helping within the system as it exists to try and get people access to it who haven't been able to access it before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=751.224s">I</a> feel like that's a lot of my work professionally. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=756.147s">And</a> so if I have the knowledge and the ability to try and do that in the role of city councilor, I'd be, you know, honored at the privilege to. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=767.914s">And</a> at the end of the day, it's really, I think just like putting yourself out there, people respond to it, cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=773.057s">They</a> don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=774.62s">tried</a> my best and I met some more neighbors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=776.24s">So</a> yeah, I think there's, I'm really, I think inspired and like excited about all the work the Kern Council is doing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=790.424s">And</a> I wanna see it keep going. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=792.405s">I</a> know that there has been a lot, not a lot of opposition, but some loud opposition to certain things going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=799.347s">And</a> I think given the federal landscape, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=804.442s">and</a> being targeted specifically here in Massachusetts by the federal administration, it would really just hurt everyone if we started to revert back to policies and programs and things that didn't put people first, didn't really consider protecting everyone, making sure everyone is welcome here and safe here.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=851.509s">Yeah,</a> that was basically the biggest thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=854.609s">And</a> I feel like particularly now people are feeling that too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=857.978s">I</a> mean, there's a primary for a reason, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=860.12s">Like</a> so many people did feel called to run for city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=864.343s">And</a> I think that plus, I also started getting involved in mutual aid Medford-Somerville mamas in 2020. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=872.209s">And</a> that has also been like huge for me as much as I like the political organizing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=879.474s">At</a> the end of the day, the systems and institutions that rule us were created unequally and exclusively <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=887.625s">So</a> I do sort of see like mutual aid and like other community-based efforts as kind of the filler of that because, you know electoral politics and organizing is only gonna get us so far. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=899.407s">And</a> so particularly like to your point of let me help someone here, like let me feel slightly in control. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=906.289s">I</a> do a grocery pair every two weeks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=908.309s">So</a> I drop off a market basket card to a neighbor in Medford who needs it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=912.43s">And</a> it's just like, you know, I know like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=915.04s">Mamas</a> in particular, they're helping so many people, but like I helped this family get their groceries and I can feel good about that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=923.965s">Despite</a> like everything, like I know that like I did what I could.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=994.428s">I</a> wish it was better. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=995.969s">I</a> do have a strong duolingo streak. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=999.452s">And</a> I try my best to practice as much as I can. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1001.574s">It's</a> really, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1003.307s">In</a> particular, I've learned Mexican Spanish is so much slower than most other Spanish, um, you know, speakers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1010.393s">And</a> so particularly living on the East coast for college and grad school, and now just being here, it's like, I'll start and say a few things and then someone will like just rattle off so quickly. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1020.962s">And</a> I'm like, Oh, let's try English. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1024.185s">Um,</a> but you know, usually I just try my best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1027.008s">Um,</a> it was my first language, but, um, when I was growing up, actually the teacher told my mom that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1032.635s">we</a> might be slow if she talked to us in two languages. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1036.777s">And</a> at the time, you know, we were my mom's first kids and she and my father used to get like hit in school for speaking Spanish. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1043.742s">So</a> she was like, Oh, okay. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1047.244s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1047.444s">Seven</a> years later, my sister's born and we're like, Oh, bilingualism. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1050.085s">It's</a> like great for kids in their development. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1053.307s">So</a> I do try my best. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1054.488s">I</a> do feel like slightly more confident. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1056.069s">I</a> think part of it is really just like, people want to see you give an effort and like communicating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1062.076s">with</a> them and if you can meet someone on their level. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1064.818s">In</a> particular, yeah, I just don't think, even myself, as a native English speaker, you don't realize just how hard it is for someone who doesn't know English. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1078.086s">And</a> English is not easy and we use so many colloquialisms and terms of phrase that's like, what are you saying? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1088.212s">And</a> yeah, in particular, I've been trying to try <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1090.938s">understand</a> more Spanish in regards to my work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1094.5s">Cause</a> not only do you need to like learn a lot of language, but specific like industry language is hard to learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1102.365s">And</a> I don't even know everything there is to know about, you know, talking about transportation in Spanish in particular.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1114.753s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1115.453s">I'm</a> like, how do you say urban planning? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1116.914s">Like,</a> I mean, I know it's urban planning, but it's like, how do you really like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1120.757s">get</a> at the core of what you're trying to say, not just like this word that might mean something to us in English, but doesn't really translate well over into another language.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1149.515s">Yeah,</a> that is actually a big part of, I think, what I want to focus on for this campaign. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1156.779s">One</a> thing I think that really came to light for me, particularly working at non-profit Walk Massachusetts, very pedestrian-focused. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1166.844s">Pedestrian,</a> technically, you know, sometimes cyclists, but really just non-car, like, cyclist movers, whether you're walking, you're playing, you have a mobility device. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1178.75s">Like</a> it's the really, it's the basics, sidewalks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1183.093s">I</a> walk a lot in my neighborhood and sometimes I'll walk down like George Street all the way down to Main Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1190.918s">And</a> there are like so many curbs that have no curb ramps. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1197.161s">And</a> I mean, I'm not, again, I'm not even using a mobility device, but I have short legs and sometimes these curbs, I'm like, these are a little like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1207.348s">Rough</a> around the edges, we have so many tree roots uprooting sidewalks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1212.012s">And</a> I think as much as people are like, well, yeah, everyone wants better sidewalk. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1218.337s">It</a> is a hindrance to people who have just a little bit of struggle walking, have a cane or mobility device. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1227.924s">Someone</a> like me who's just uncoordinated at times. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1232.56s">I</a> like, I mean, actually I didn't trip on a sidewalk. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1235.201s">I</a> tripped on my own porch and sprained my ankle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1236.742s">So</a> that was on me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1238.422s">But</a> I think that's a big one for me in particular, not just like, okay, is the sidewalk flat? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1243.564s">Do</a> we have curb ramps at every corner? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1247.206s">Curb</a> ramps with, you know, the tactile landing that also points in the correct direction. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1252.107s">There's</a> so many times you see those and they're like not even going the right way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1255.969s">So</a> if someone is vision impaired or has low vision, like they might be led into the wrong area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1262.73s">Um,</a> so that plus no removal and like just debris in general, uh, big, big for me because I, you know, walk to the Greenline station when I go into work a couple of days a week. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1276.64s">And</a> this past winter in particular really made me mad. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1280.123s">Um,</a> and as someone who's kind of taken a peek behind the curtain in regards to like transportation, uh, a lot of what you might run into if you're walking around the city and there's not like snow removed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1292.858s">particularly</a> like on a little bridge, like over the commuter rail, often it's jurisdiction like arguments. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1301.702s">So</a> MassDOT, my employer, owns that, you know, part of the sidewalk. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1306.523s">And</a> understandably, most municipalities are going to stop where they have to stop because they don't have the money or the funds to like keep paying for the removal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1316.007s">But</a> in particular, this past winter, the sidewalk from like Nick's Pizza all the way <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1321.308s">up</a> until like right when they have the nice repaved sidewalk by the T station, just fully like a sheet of ice. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1329.315s">And</a> I'm like, you know, penguin walking to make sure I don't slip and fall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1334.159s">I've</a> done it so many, I think I've done it every winter. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1337.962s">And</a> so I actually just started taking the bus up to the station because I knew that I would get, you know, avoid most of that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1344.047s">But</a> you know, if I, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1347.84s">I</a> saw plenty of people walking over it, but it's like, we shouldn't have to do that first of all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1352.642s">And</a> if we want to encourage people to walk more or just support people who need to walk for whatever reason, we have to do that at all times of the year.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1392.005s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1393.426s">And</a> so just like little things like that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1395.307s">And</a> so I think part of what that looks like for me is like having the city complete an ADA transition plan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1402.735s">which</a> would sort of lay out like, okay, where are our deficiencies? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1407.197s">And,</a> you know, the city did do a kind of like a sidewalk inventory report in 2021, which did lay out everything. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1413.16s">It's</a> just a matter of like, you know, committing the money and the like manpower to doing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1419.283s">And</a> then also thinking about like, not just like for this transition plan, where do we need curb ramps, but like, what about our buildings, our recreation, like opportunities, like where are we failing to really be accessible <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1432.89s">And</a> that's just thinking about sort of like the physical accessibility. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1435.512s">That's</a> not even thinking about like, you know, language. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1440.695s">Do</a> we have things that are like services that allow people to be involved? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1445.138s">If</a> they have like other commitments, child, you know, childcare. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1447.94s">And</a> then as well, you know, thinking about people who are neurodivergent or just learn in different ways. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1455.726s">I've</a> had <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1458.068s">I</a> don't want to say the privilege, but my sister is on the spectrum. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1461.05s">I've</a> worked a lot with people who are neurodivergent. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1463.792s">And</a> so I've come to not understand, but I think really kind of get that picture of like what it's like when something really isn't clicking for whatever reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1473.458s">And</a> just, okay, how do we just rearrange how we explain this or offer this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1480.183s">And</a> even some folks who I've met in Medford who are on the spectrum or have different <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1487.921s">intellectual</a> or developmental disabilities or like just the slight change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1493.343s">And</a> when we kind of become inclusive and accessible for what seems like a small population, but it's not, we actually are just making it easier for everyone involved and to understand what's going on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1509.45s">It's</a> not just for this like specific group, but we're actually making it better for everyone. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1513.372s">You</a> know, when sidewalks are smooth, someone in a wheelchair can use them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1517.228s">but</a> it also means like, as you get older, if you want to keep living in Medford, you don't have to worry about tripping and then like needing a full knee replacement as a result. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1529.753s">So</a> I think that's something I always keep in mind. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1531.793s">And</a> it's not just for people who need it now, but we're all going to need it at some point.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1563.733s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1575.237s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1576.757s">I</a> want, I think this kind of, for me, falls under accessibility too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1580.099s">I</a> want more benches, more places for people to sit and rest. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1585.842s">Ideally,</a> I'd want like a bench at every bus stop. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1588.663s">I</a> don't care where that bus stop is. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1589.944s">I</a> want a bench there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1592.005s">And</a> the hill I'll die on is I don't want a bench with an armrest in the middle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1598.411s">I,</a> if listeners have not heard of the term hostile architecture, sort of the kind of approach to architecture and like seating that lends itself to not letting people lay down or we don't want people loitering for whatever reason in this area. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1626.892s">And</a> what might seem like, oh, well, we don't want certain people in and around here, which I don't care about. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1633.935s">But</a> even if that was your thing, all that kind of infrastructure or lack thereof, like in New York City, is it Moynihan station where they just took everything out? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1646.662s">One</a> of their train stations, super busy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1650.443s">just</a> no seating. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1652.084s">They're</a> like, we're just not going to have anyone sit here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1654.285s">And</a> it's like, okay, but if I went there and I have four kids and we each have bags, like that's hurting me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1662.27s">If</a> I'm elderly and need somewhere to rest, that's hurting me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1667.113s">If</a> I broke my leg and I'm on crutches right now, that's going to negatively affect me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1673.757s">So</a> I want benches everywhere. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1675.198s">And</a> if people need to lay down on them, that's fine with me.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1722.492s">They're</a> just going to go somewhere else, and anyone deserves help. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1728.769s">strong</a> believer in the tenets of harm reduction and the ways that that looks in terms of municipal policy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1739.853s">But</a> yeah, no, being on benches, I was actually able to get, we got a grant when I was still at the city for bus infrastructure improvement. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1748.756s">So</a> the bus shelter that's across the street from Dempsey's and sort of near Elta Cuba, like across the corner from, or across from the cemetery, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1758.867s">by</a> City Hall, we got those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1761.568s">And</a> then I believe on Salem Street, if you see like, there's like four or five like benches that are kind of like brownish in color, bought those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1771.31s">And</a> I was very adamant that I was going to get these and not have them have an armrest in the middle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1777.791s">I</a> even actually was able to get the bus shelters when we talked with the TEAS team about getting them because they have the contract we could hop on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1785.413s">I</a> had said, I want that bar removed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1788.187s">and</a> we got it removed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1789.348s">They</a> were very surprised and I think I was the first person who ever requested it, but I was happy to do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1794.092s">So</a> I want more of those. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0OmcFXZuPqr9Ko69rUml99?t=1796.634s">Yeah.</a>

 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1622.436s">Miranda</a> Briseño to Taylor Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1626.717s">Yeah,</a> so I just wanted to echo the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1630.059s">I</a> don't live in South Medford, but I've both walked and driven and biked through it enough to know what these problems look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1637.481s">And</a> while I, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1641.05s">Support</a> signs is an interim approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1644.052s">The</a> best way to slow cars down, whether or not they're cutting through streets is to simply redesign our streets to be a lot safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1652.077s">We</a> can be narrowing lanes, putting speed humps, speed tables onto these residential streets to really force drivers to go slower. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1660.662s">And</a> similarly relying on enforcement <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1666.655s">really</a> can backfire and be really unsafe for a lot of communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1672.179s">So</a> the best kind of enforcement that we as a community can investment is better designed streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=1680.746s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3844.628s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3845.43s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3850.147s">I'll</a> just echo what Ellery stated and similar to what Councilor Tseng, Collins, and Bears have stated, the state has already existed, has been provided to us by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3859.553s">And</a> so utilizing this data would allow us to understand why that significant difference exists in traffic stops for our Black and Latino neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3868.078s">And</a> to bring this back to the issue discussed on South Medford and traffic concerns, the primary way the general public interacts with law enforcement is through traffic stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3878.144s">This</a> data from the state is already showing there are disproportionate stops for our Black and Latino neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3883.648s">Data</a> in communities across the country has shown that our Black and Latino neighbors are at disproportionate risk of dying through their interactions with law enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3892.355s">In</a> addition, if you overlay old redlining maps that show high disinvestment and neglect in primarily Black and immigrant neighborhoods with where current traffic fatalities and high traffic concern areas are, these are the same neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3905.084s">Similarly,</a> more data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has shown that as pedestrians, black residents of Massachusetts are more than four times likely than white residents to visit the emergency department as a result of being hit by a vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3918.839s">In</a> addition, nationwide data has shown the disproportionate risk that black residents <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3923.723s">to</a> be a traffic fatality than white residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3926.465s">So</a> at the end of the day, if we're looking to keep our community safe, both from the negative consequences of high volume car traffic, we can also be addressing the true safety concerns that Black, Brown, and other marginalized communities have when interacting with law enforcement by investing more than we are now into safer street design. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=3943.518s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q/2024-11-19__tT-sIarT8Q.html">City Council 09-21-21</a></h2>
