 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1702.447s">Testing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1703.047s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1705.742s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1706.662s">My</a> name is Miranda Berseno. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1708.463s">I</a> love calling Medford home, and I'm running for City Council to make sure that City Hall delivers better for residents of all ages, wages, and backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1717.744s">We</a> deserve a Medford that invests robustly in the public places that keep us connected to each other, like our schools, parks, and library. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1725.366s">We</a> deserve a library that is open seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1727.986s">We</a> deserve a Medford with plenty of shade trees and green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1732.175s">As</a> a renter, I felt firsthand how hard it is to afford to remain here amid the skyrocketing cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1737.837s">We</a> all deserve a more affordable Medford, where elders can age in place and where new and long-time residents alike can put down roots without fear of displacement due to rising rents and home prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1749.68s">Medford</a> students and families deserve thriving public schools and expanded after-school and pre-K. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1755.161s">Our</a> school staff deserves competitive pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1757.942s">I</a> will fight for a budget that allows us to meet these goals every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1762.178s">In</a> addition, I proudly support building a new flagship Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1767.479s">We</a> deserve a Medford that invests in keeping all of our neighbors safe through an unarmed mental health crisis response team, continued noncompliance with ICE, and better social services for our neighbors in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1779.623s">Safety</a> also means our roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1782.023s">And</a> as a transportation planner, road safety is my bread and butter. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1785.464s">In</a> the last five years, Medford has seen at least 84 crashes which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1792.28s">we</a> need to treat traffic violence like the emergency it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1796.241s">At</a> MassDOT, I work with municipalities to help them utilize transportation funding to its full potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1801.902s">I</a> work closely on funding for large capital projects and I help manage essential programs such as the Safe Routes to School program. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1808.684s">This</a> has given me a bird's eye view of the regional problems that affect us here in Medford and where the solutions lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1814.741s">As</a> your city councilor, I will make sure we strategically leverage our transportation funding to make our streets safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1821.765s">I</a> will also make sure the city completes an ADA transition plan so that everyone can participate in civic life and enjoy all that Medford has to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1830.549s">But</a> before my time at MassDOT, I worked right here for Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1834.552s">I</a> spearheaded Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, which provided crucial funding to Medford's restaurants, corner stores, salons, and spas to help them survive during an unpredictable time. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1845.268s">I</a> developed the city's first outdoor dining program, and I helped the city improve its bus stop and blues bikes infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1852.255s">As</a> a MassDOT employee, I'm heavily involved in my union, and I currently serve on its board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1858.842s">Medford</a> runs on union power, and I'm proud to be endorsed by SEIU Local 509 and UAW Region 9A. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1866.955s">I</a> love being a part of our diverse, multi-generational, vibrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1871.22s">My</a> neighbours have always been there for me, and now I'm running for City Council to make sure the city is there for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1876.786s">I</a> look forward to meeting you and talking with you, and I hope to earn your vote this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1880.39s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw/2025-08-06_cZff0fmztDw.html">City Council

 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7410.008s">Hi,</a> I'm Miranda Briceño. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7411.369s">I'm</a> at 2 Taylor Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7413.647s">Thank</a> you for the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7415.608s">I</a> am in favor of this ordinance, and I will tell you why. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7419.348s">Investing</a> in businesses that are helping destroy communities through violence, incarceration, or the climate crisis is a bad financial decision in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7427.61s">Reinvesting</a> in businesses that build and grow our economies is our financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7432.311s">I'm</a> eager to see my tax dollars responsibly invested in companies, projects, and banks that prioritize people over profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7439.053s">How</a> we spend our money is a statement of our values. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7441.734s">As</a> we exist in a capitalist system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can... <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7452.794s">As</a> we can, sorry, as we exist in a capital system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can assert our ability to refuse participation in industries that are actively harming people, our environment, and prioritizing profit over people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7466.527s">I</a> support that this ordinance recognizes the slow process that is divestment. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7471.352s">We</a> won't be able to move our money and accounts overnight from companies that are actively causing harm across the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7476.978s">So</a> deciding to actively choose contracts and do businesses with companies that are aligned with our values as a city as a result of this ordinance is just one crucial step in putting Medford on the right side of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7487.408s">The</a> idea that this issue doesn't affect Medford is naive at best and actively ignorant at worst. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7492.714s">We</a> live in a globalized world whether we want to or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7495.552s">This</a> is not about politics, this is about prioritizing humanity as we watch our climate degrade, we watch multiple genocides across the world, and our neighbors unjustly incarcerated so that private prisons and war industry companies can continue to profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7509.756s">At</a> a time when the federal government clearly does not care about anyone but billionaires, companies, and arming their allies, <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7515.892s">Medford</a> must take a stand where we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7518.154s">The</a> federal government is already targeting Massachusetts and its communities, illegally so, and clearly the federal government does not care about legality, morality, or people at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7528.042s">The</a> same federal government that is spending our tax dollars to fund an armed Gestapo with no oversight, building prison camps on US soil, and further contributing to human rights violations, it is incumbent on Medford to take a stand and do what we can as a city to support people worldwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/cZff0fmztDw&t=7543.534s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-06-26_nxzvg6ywlhM/2025-06-26_nxzvg6ywlhM.html">Zoning Q&A/Info Session - Parking Strategies 06-09-25</a></h2>
 <p>[Miranda Briseno]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5067.693s">Hi,</a> I live on Taylor Street, the hillside area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5073.118s">1st,</a> I just want to plug that mascot actually has a lot of vehicle ownership data. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5078.001s">Available</a> to municipalities that breaks it down by vehicle type. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5083.566s">Personal</a> commercial also has a lot of data on through the cities and the average daily mileage. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5094.474s">You</a> know, all of the cars that I think would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5098.217s">I</a> just want to echo a lot of what's been said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5101.539s">Induced</a> demand exists and the reality is that the 38,000 cars that exist in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5107.904s">If</a> we eliminated parking minimums tonight would still be here tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5111.767s">Mine</a> included. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5113.728s">So</a> I think removing those parking minimums. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5117.03s">will</a> still will support and encourage developers or smaller owners to not consider having parking, but it's still not going to change people who do need and want to build parking anyway, because again, there are almost 40,000 cars in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5137.821s">I</a> mean, I would have loved to not buy a car a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5141.353s">my</a> insurance, my car payment monthly, you know, gas, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5145.154s">I</a> mean, I bought a hybrid, I was excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5147.315s">But,</a> you know, like, I would have loved to not have that experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5150.596s">But</a> it just, I sat on it for about two months before I finally made the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5154.017s">I</a> would have loved not to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5156.558s">But</a> here I am anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5158.619s">So</a> even as a car owner, as someone who has spent a lot of time with people with mobility limitations, the parking that people need will be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5169.158s">And</a> we can find ways to support those that don't need a car, don't want a car, can't afford a car, and are reliant on public transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nxzvg6ywlhM&t=5176.963s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc/2025-04-09_4-jeNb9kYhc.html">City Council Meeting 04-08-25</a></h2>
