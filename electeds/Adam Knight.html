 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=111.078s">Madam</a> President, point of personal privilege.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=114.681s">No,</a> Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=118.103s">So</a> do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=128.468s">We</a> can dispose of the paper first.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=191.323s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=194.664s">Shortly</a> after the budget debates in late June, following 16 weeks of pregnancy, my brother and his wife gave birth to their second child, Amira. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=203.467s">And</a> after several months of hospitalization, <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=206.935s">She</a> was unable to withstand the college medical procedures and was laid to rest in mid-October. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=215.178s">I've</a> served on this council for a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=217.639s">I</a> think my record will reflect that my first eight years of service, I missed one regular city council meeting, and that was for the birth of my second child, Brandon. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=229.824s">I</a> don't think anybody in this room can say that I haven't come to these meetings prepared, ready, or able to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=242.503s">When</a> I first decided to run for elected office, it was with the support of my family and the understanding that they were always going to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=250.968s">That's</a> what needed to happen during this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=253.609s">So</a> I do regret my absence from the council during this period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=258.391s">It's</a> a very private and personal matter to both me and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=261.473s">But</a> quite frankly, it was something I felt like I needed to share this evening, albeit reluctantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=268.263s">I</a> offer this not specifically of a justification for my absences, but for an explanation to the voters here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=276.169s">You</a> know, I've heard the conspiracy theories and underfunded criticisms and comments made by many people in this community, and I find it necessary that I address the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=286.917s">So</a> I thank you, Madam President, for entertaining me at this time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=943.0s">Madam</a> President, it appears to be rather self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=945.481s">I'm</a> comfortable moving forward, absent the presentation from the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1486.726s">And</a> with that, I will go- Mr. President, I just want to reiterate the fact that- Councilor Knight, I haven't recognized you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1494.531s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1494.792s">I'd</a> like to fact check.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1819.209s">Mr.</a> President, just on the facts, I believe you stated the school committee's salary has not increased from a figure of $12,000 per annual. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1834.105s">Mr.</a> President, you did mention that the school committee's <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1842.648s">Monetary</a> figure may not have changed since the year 2000, but I do believe that their compensation structure has changed, which is something that's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1851.534s">Previously,</a> their compensation structure was that of a stipend, which made the position a line item budget item. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1858.099s">And</a> now it's turned into a pension eligible health insurance eligible benefited position, which therefore can become <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1866.164s">what</a> would be called an unfunded pension liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1869.187s">So</a> that's something that we also have to take a look at as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1871.729s">But</a> the pay structure did change from the way that the committee was compensated to the way they are currently compensated previously, where stipends were added and included into their salaries to raise that pay and reflect pensionable monetary gain.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1894.77s">Point</a> of information on that, I do believe if the mayor's in the room, she can tell us when she was on the council how she collected health insurance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=1905.276s">When</a> she became mayor and didn't need it anymore?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2981.244s">I</a> just want to know when these discussions happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2983.548s">I'll</a> recognize you after Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=2985.852s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3338.029s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3342.332s">Must</a> have some English teachers in the room today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3344.554s">Fiction,</a> maybe a little fiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3345.935s">There's</a> some fiction going on here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3348.197s">You</a> know, it's a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3351.319s">But</a> to me, being the cynic that I am, it does somewhat sound like a money grab for the faces that I share in campaign literature. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3361.998s">You</a> run as a slate, and then the first thing you do is move to give raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3366.699s">I</a> think that presents a questionable standard of ethics that the next council is going to have to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3378.043s">And</a> I don't think it's fair to them that they're going to be put in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3382.024s">When</a> looking at the paper on face value, the paper is contrary to law. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3387.643s">Um,</a> you know, we look at MGL section 71 chapter 71 section 53 as the enabling language to give the city council the authority to issue raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3399.571s">But</a> if you look what that section of the general law says, um, in its first line, it says the school committee shall serve without compensation, but they may be compensated for this services by a majority vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3416.042s">This</a> has already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3418.851s">This</a> has already been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3423.355s">The</a> language in the general laws that speaks to salary adjustments is governed under Chapter 44, Section 33A. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3434.284s">And</a> this section clearly reads that the annual budget shall include the sum sufficient to pay the salaries of all officers and employees, fixed by law or witness. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3444.373s">Our</a> budget's passed, and these figures are not included in that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3450.046s">The</a> section also reads, no new position shall be created or an increase in any rate made by ordinance, vote, or appointment during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget, unless provision, therefore, has been made by means of a supplemental appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3471.392s">Without</a> a money paper, we can't change the ordinance based on state law in my reading, which is a question for <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3480.523s">the</a> ever so invisible and elusive city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3490.529s">I</a> thank the council president for entertaining me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3494.832s">Included</a> in our packets this evening were a series of amendments that I have offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3499.114s">In</a> response to this paper, I would spare the chairman the <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3505.856s">long</a> duration of having to read through it and motion that it be included as part of this paper going forward and hope that the new city council and their divine wisdom acts in the best interest of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3526.147s">We</a> hear a lot of talk about a revenue crisis, the need for the city of Medford to raise more revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3534.431s">the</a> need for a Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3538.032s">And</a> when this issue came up previously, there was some discussion about whether or not it was really a revenue crisis or a spending problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3549.115s">And</a> I think that when we look at a paper like this, I think that it shows that we do have a little bit of a spending problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3558.057s">And</a> a solution to hard decisions a lot of the time is to throw money at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3564.591s">And</a> that does not fix systemic problems and issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=3570.357s">So</a> with that being said, I do thank my council colleague for the time and do ask that the paper be included by way of a motion to waive the reading and include.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8144.312s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8145.732s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8147.753s">First</a> of all, I think we can all agree that diversity is important, and it's commendable for a public official to pursue diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8162.176s">I</a> also think that this issue before us here sheds light on a perfect example of why diversity of thought <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8174.571s">and</a> diversity of opinion is necessary when you go to the ballot box and you cast your vote to elect somebody to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8188.481s">Because</a> without diversity of thought, without diversity of opinion, what you're going to see is more and more of the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8198.168s">So</a> I leave you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8201.35s">Moving</a> forward, everybody behind this rail makes decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8205.353s">based</a> upon what they feel is those in the best interest of the city of Medford in one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8212.456s">And</a> it's not easy to come out here every evening and be criticized and be trolled and be attacked. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8219.679s">And</a> all it is is an opportunity for us to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8223.94s">Now,</a> Councilor Penta came up and said that someone should make a motion to receive this and place this on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8230.803s">Then</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8234.065s">It</a> fails, then what? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8239.467s">Then</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8242.668s">I</a> think it's safe to say that we're all acting on behalf of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8249.79s">And</a> it's that diversity of thought and that diversity of opinion on how do we address issues like this that's really coming into play right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8261.323s">For</a> these reasons, I'm going to support the paper this evening, because quite frankly, I attached five amendments to it that ask a number of significant legal questions as to whether or not this is even the appropriate process, or whether or not the paper is even in proper legal form. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8277.19s">And</a> as we move forward, this isn't going to be the last you hear of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8281.812s">This</a> isn't going to be the last you hear of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8283.132s">It's</a> going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8284.693s">When</a> your landscape is out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8288.035s">blowing</a> the leaves in your yard with an electric leaf blower. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8291.257s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8291.877s">You</a> guys are gonna still be talking about the school committee and whether or not they're getting a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8295.398s">That's</a> the fact of the mat, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8298.04s">But</a> with that being said, you know, I think that, you know, when we move forward in this community and we think about what direction we're gonna go in, diversity of thought and diversity of opinion is something that we really need to think about.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8608.488s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8609.809s">Mr.</a> President, the more I think about this, <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8614.138s">the</a> more I think that there could potentially be a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8617.959s">And,</a> you know, week in and week out we come up here and we have Mina come up and talk to us about all the great things that the mayor's doing, all these grants and these outside contracts that they have and consultants that they have that are running the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8631.905s">And</a> one of the things that the mayor's been touting as of recent is the fact that we have a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8638.828s">We</a> have this wonderful grant for a compensation equity study. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8643.473s">Now,</a> we got the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8644.253s">I</a> don't know if the study started or not, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8647.875s">But</a> we have these titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8649.376s">And</a> they want to go around to every other surrounding community, and they're going to see what people in these titles make. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8655.139s">Why</a> wouldn't we refer this paper to the city administration for inclusion in the compensation classification study that's provided by grant funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8662.442s">We're</a> costing the city $0. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8663.343s">I</a> would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8664.704s">Take</a> this off our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8667.265s">Let's</a> see what the report says when it comes back to see if they're being compensated equitably. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8670.927s">I</a> would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8672.52s">And</a> if they are, they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8674.821s">And</a> if they aren't, we've got a report there that's been done by an outside third party that's compared this with all those surrounding communities and people in like responsible positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8682.705s">And</a> then we'll be able to provide something that's driven by data and it's not driven by desire.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j424Dcv3DNY&t=8695.575s">I'd</a> like to make it as a motion.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_EwoILHnJVI8/2024-10-05_EwoILHnJVI8.html">City Council 09-05-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=207.309s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=208.65s">And</a> I join Councilor Scarpelli in offering my condolences to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=212.935s">Mr.</a> Garrity was a great person, Lawrence State's resident, known by friends and family alike as Bayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=220.238s">And</a> I think Councilor Scott Nelly hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=223.439s">Although</a> he's left us here, he's going to leave a legacy behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=227.701s">If</a> it weren't for the Garrity family, I don't think the city would have been in a good position to create the Office of Outreach and Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=235.384s">But</a> they came up with this council and they advocated for this story out there, and they helped fight the addiction stigma. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=241.821s">and</a> it was because of their work that Wisconsin has been able to move forward this season, fighting the epidemic and I just want to echo Councilor Scarpelli's indulgences and also my gratitude for their services.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=273.942s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=274.943s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=348.434s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=349.816s">It's</a> amazing to think that what started out as a small convenience store in Malden three generations of family ago has now transformed into one of the largest camera stores around. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=360.146s">I</a> had the great pleasure and opportunity to go to school with both Scott and Gary, and I call them both friends actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=365.872s">I</a> see Gary quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=367.274s">He's</a> moved back to Metro recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=369.207s">And</a> it's just great to see that they've been able to continue the family tradition and continue so much success with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=374.711s">So</a> I want to wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors and congratulate them on such a momentous occasion.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1661.348s">Thank</a> you for the explanation, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1663.309s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1684.68s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1776.311s">Madam</a> President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1780.773s">This</a> is a contractually adjusted wage increase that's been negotiated by the administration and the union.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=1805.908s">I</a> have never been one to stand in the way of waiving the readings to ensure that hardworking men and women in the city of Medford receive the cost of living adjustments as they duly deserve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2139.841s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2142.283s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2620.144s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2621.965s">I</a> think it's also very important to point out that this is 100% an enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2626.799s">And</a> we do have the controls in place and it's a matter of the administration taking steps that are necessary to ensure that neighborhoods are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2634.681s">So</a> that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2636.101s">And</a> number two, we also have to think about what's prompting residents in this community to move towards not being landlords and instead being Airbnb operators. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2646.184s">And</a> some of it has to do with the discussion, I think, about policies that might go into effect in this community in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2652.465s">Some</a> of it has to do with the fact that there's a lot of strong tenant rights laws <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2656.425s">And</a> landlords feel like sometimes they're at a disadvantage when they go in to pursue non payment or rent issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2663.354s">So</a> policy that we create also impacts these trends in housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2669.907s">So</a> it's important for us to look at the big picture as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2672.709s">But</a> I can certainly agree with all my council colleagues and saying that this is 100% enforcement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2676.931s">And</a> it's something that needs to be handled the forthright. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2680.713s">Ultimately,</a> you know, it's about protecting the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2682.934s">And</a> right now we're not doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2684.094s">And</a> that's something we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2685.095s">So</a> I thank the council for bringing the issue forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2721.533s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=2722.913s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3711.02s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3713.942s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3715.803s">I</a> look at this in a couple of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3718.905s">The</a> first of which is, you know, all of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3722.29s">getting</a> involved between someone trying to sell a house and someone trying to buy a house and the regulations and restrictions that surround it is part of the due diligence process when you're purchasing a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3734.222s">or</a> when you're purchasing a piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3736.643s">And</a> I know that that's a process that's heavily regulated as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3742.505s">I</a> think we better be very careful in how far we're going to be going in performing the due diligence for these private landowners conducting private land transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3753.23s">So,</a> with that being said, you know, I can certainly see the issue going on with the lack of enforcement of BMPs in the community, the strict code that we've established that would provide you only 90 days a year for rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3765.678s">But</a> at the end of the day, you know, I think that there has to be a spot where government doesn't get so involved in people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3771.322s">So,</a> we have to draw our line somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3772.823s">And</a> I think that when that line is doing the due diligence for <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3778.638s">potential</a> homebuyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3780.679s">It</a> just doesn't really fall within the scope of what a government service is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3784.5s">And</a> I think that at the end of the day, we'd be providing far too much energy and effort and performing an exercise that's not going to reap great results. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3792.903s">I</a> think we'd be much better off putting our energy, efforts, and time into enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=3798.624s">So</a> that's where I stand on this matter, but thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4123.834s">That's</a> an old high five, Madam President, my apologies.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4652.611s">On</a> that point, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4656.454s">I</a> think it's important to point out that we probably do have one of the strongest short-term rental ordinances in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4663.92s">But</a> again, it's an issue about enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4666.763s">To</a> Mr. Castagnetti's question, this has been <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4671.821s">reviewed</a> at the state level extensively, and it's been determined that local municipalities can't ban them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4678.164s">But</a> what we can do is regulate them, but we can regulate them only to a certain extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4682.466s">And</a> we've utilized our legislative power to do that to the fullest. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=4686.728s">The</a> question now is, can the administration put the teeth that we gave them to good use, and be sure that our ordinance is enforced to the level that the taxpayers deserve?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5309.265s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5310.606s">I</a> think moving forward as we go through our zoning reform, this is something we also might want to take a look at where the ADA requires a minimum of 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5317.89s">I</a> don't think there's anything that could prevent us from requiring more than that, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5323.054s">Number</a> two, as we've established policies in this community as a council through zoning reform that's reduced <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5329.077s">the</a> parking minimums in certain developments with that obviously would come a reduction in the number of parking for handicapped blackout holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5336.62s">So</a> again, you know, an unintended consequence of policy change. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5340.321s">So</a> it's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=5341.602s">And</a> I think a good way to approach that might be through our next round of zoning codification and maybe increasing the minimum number of parking spots that would be required or reserved for our disabled residents here in the community and elsewhere that are visiting our community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6210.398s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6216.471s">I</a> am at a loss sitting here hearing that after the amount of money that we spent on outside council, that represents the mayor personally and not the city of Medford, an amount of money is some of the totals close to a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6243.175s">over</a> $450,000 we spent on KP Law's legal fees in what appears to be violation of city ordinance, Madam Mayor, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6254.545s">Once</a> again, I'm calling you Madam Mayor, because I'm just wishing it would be somebody else, but the one that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6260.03s">When</a> I think about this, Madam President, it makes me crazy, because for three years, I feel like I was talking in an echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6269.767s">saying</a> we need to hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6271.429s">We</a> need a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6272.49s">We</a> need to hire a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6273.791s">We</a> still don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6275.353s">Instead,</a> we have a private law firm that we paid a half a million dollars to. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6280.097s">It's</a> too busy to go to court and represent the interests of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6285.363s">That</a> shows you where their priorities lay. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6289.807s">It</a> also shows you how inept this administration is. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6294.645s">when</a> it comes to the deliverance of basic city services, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6298.108s">And</a> number two, the protection of the taxpayers' interests when it comes to having in-house legal counsel that represents the taxpayer and not the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6307.697s">So</a> here we are again, two months after the budget passed, asking for more money for a code enforcement office. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6313.643s">So</a> when we had an opportunity, when we had an opportunity to hold up a budget and get what we needed, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6319.788s">Number</a> two, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6320.891s">And</a> we're coming off the heels of a budget where the mayor said she was gonna hire a solicitor and an assistant city solicitor for the council and never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6327.655s">Unfulfilled</a> promises, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6333.739s">Unfulfilled</a> promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6337.301s">This</a> has been the number one issue, the number one underlying theme throughout this past term for this council is where is our legal representation? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6347.727s">We're</a> driving a ship without a compass. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6350.615s">We're</a> going into uncharted territory, and we need guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6353.938s">Please</a> help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6356.079s">Please</a> help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6358.141s">That's</a> the council asking, and the council gets ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6363.685s">Now,</a> Madam President, we have residents asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6367.047s">They're</a> saying, please help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6368.549s">Please</a> help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6369.409s">And</a> they're now being ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6370.95s">And</a> KP law is defaulting on court appearances that they filed, that they filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6380.046s">KP</a> law is directing the board of health not to put clean it and lean it notices on homes after the council is directing them to do so because such levels of dissatisfaction in the public administration of the enforcement of code. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6400.422s">So</a> again, we can put the record on repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6402.904s">Madam</a> president, here we are again, the same spot we were 12 months ago, the same ones we were the same spot we were 12 months before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6410.552s">I</a> sit here and I scratch my head every day and I say, let's name one thing the city does well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6420.26s">Let's</a> name one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6423.462s">Our</a> school test scores are down about eight, 9% across the board in the last three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6430.067s">Our</a> city streets look awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6432.209s">Our</a> sidewalks look terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6434.411s">We</a> can't get trees trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6436.012s">We</a> can't get stumps removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6437.822s">We</a> can't get crosswalks repainted. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6439.744s">We</a> can't get 3-3 paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6443.326s">The</a> only saving grace we have in this community is we pick up that phone and dial 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6446.969s">And</a> we know that the police and the fire are always going to show up with or without a contract for 700 plus days. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6457.677s">So</a> when I sit here and I reflect on what's going on in this community and I ask myself, what are we doing well? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6463.922s">What</a> are we doing well? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6465.343s">That's</a> one of the hottest questions I have to struggle with every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6468.598s">Because</a> when I look around, I don't see anything that we're doing well, that we're exceeding at, that we're excelling at. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6472.641s">I</a> don't see anything that's putting Medford on the forefront, that's keeping Medford where it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6482.469s">10</a> years ago when I got elected, Medford was the hottest zip code in Massachusetts because of its large inventory of single family homes and its small class sizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6492.516s">Boy,</a> how times have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6494.218s">Boy,</a> how times have changed, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6498.766s">We're</a> a community that's losing its identity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6503.069s">And</a> pretty soon we're going to be swallowed up and become just a pocket of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6508.733s">The</a> zoning reform that's coming up is going to be very important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6512.355s">And</a> I hope the mayor keeps her word this time around and provides us with the tools necessary to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6518.34s">Because</a> right now, I feel as though the city is not in a strong position for now or for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6523.063s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6741.683s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6747.566s">I</a> have a question regarding enforcement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6937.516s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6939.217s">Actually</a> Tufts through their development has agreed with the city to pay taxes, property taxes, I believe in all the new purchases of land and I've done so for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6950.881s">But</a> I think Madam President that the most moving thing that was said tonight was take care of the good people because if you don't, you're going to lose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6958.704s">And</a> you're just going to get more of the bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6963.254s">I</a> really think that was the most moving thing that was said this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6966.057s">Take</a> care of the good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6967.079s">Give</a> the good people some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6968.749s">because</a> that's all they're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6970.99s">So</a> I appreciate the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6972.291s">That's</a> something that really resonated with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6974.572s">I</a> think that, you know, we all know what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6977.113s">We</a> need to get action on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6978.534s">We</a> need to hold the administration accountable for their failures and delivering the basic public services that these people deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6984.457s">And</a> I can't understand why we don't have a program or a maintenance plan or a review plan where we go out to these distressed properties, which we know we've had problems with. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6994.088s">year</a> after year and do a spot check once every 6, 8 or 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=6999.154s">I</a> mean, it's basic, basic, basic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7001.697s">The</a> person that's answering the phone knows the phone's gonna, knows they're gonna get the phone call and when they see who it is that's calling them, <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7007.594s">know</a> exactly what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7008.615s">It's</a> gotten to that point with people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7011.817s">So</a> I don't understand why we can't take a couple of steps and be a little bit more proactive and have an outreach program where, you know, when we know we have these distressed properties and these properties that are failing to do right by the neighborhood, that we don't go out there and do a little bit of outreach and preventative maintenance, as they like to say, to prevent this from happening and rising to this level of frustration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7531.9s">I</a> want to commend my council colleague for suggesting that we move to supplement our code enforcement staff with the use of, whether it be retired police officers, was it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7546.945s">Or</a> code enforcement?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7565.482s">Yeah,</a> I mean, I think that's a great idea, especially when you look at how human resources in this community is handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7572.547s">I</a> mean, how many times have we had per diem department heads? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7575.95s">We've</a> had a per diem assessor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7578.292s">We've</a> had a per diem building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7580.313s">We</a> had a per diem veteran services director. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7583.676s">Why</a> can't we do that with code? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=7586.638s">That</a> sounds like a great idea to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8033.182s">That</a> was an oldie but goodie.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8164.491s">Madam</a> President, I will be happy to waive the reading and give a brief synopsis as my intention is to request that this go to some subcommittee or committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8180.09s">Jesus</a> Christmas.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8210.553s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8211.754s">I</a> bring this resolution forward requesting that we have a little bit more accountability and some tracking and measurement of data when it comes to the use of take-home vehicles here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8220.258s">Now,</a> there are certain positions in the community that one would expect as a take-home vehicle, the chief of police, the chief of fire, the DPW commissioner, but there are other positions in this community where people are allowed to take-home vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8232.123s">So</a> the question therein remains, how much use and wear and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being utilized for purposes <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8241.357s">work.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8242.517s">Ultimately,</a> this council has appropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars for the replacement of equipment and part of our fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8250.6s">And</a> as we go through the process of replacing vehicles that are becoming, I guess we'd say, less equipped to deal with the wear and tear of our everyday <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8261.76s">work</a> that we perform here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8264.883s">It's</a> interesting to see where these new vehicles are going and what their uses are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8269.046s">Ultimately,</a> you know, I think that there are some protections that we need to put in place to prevent the city from getting into circumstances where we might be liable for things that we didn't anticipate we were going to become liable for. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8280.193s">Now,</a> whether or not these trucks are provided by contract or by grant, the department head or the mayor, they do have implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8288.036s">For</a> example, Madam President, if someone were provided a take-home vehicle and they were injured in the line of work, the cost of that take-home vehicle goes towards their wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8297.139s">So</a> when they're out of work collecting compensation, they'd be compensated based upon the wage that they earn plus the value of the vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8305.073s">So</a> that greatly increases the city's liability when it comes down to certain issues of employees that are into the line of work, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8311.299s">Number</a> two, take-home vehicles also increase the city's liability if there were an accident to occur outside of working hours, outside of city limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8321.387s">There's</a> also a question about how much of the city's resources in the form of gasoline <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8328.392s">and</a> other maintenance and upkeep necessities are being placed on these vehicles through the commute to and from work and they're not used inside the city limits or for city purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8339.276s">So</a> the intention of the ordinance, Madam President, is to put some restrictions upon this and put some data reporting requirements on this so the city knows where their fleet is, what their fleet is doing, when they're doing it outside of city limits and outside of city operating hours and how much <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8353.92s">wear</a> and tear is being put on these vehicles that's being done not in the performance of the city duties but in the performance of traveling to and from work commuting and other items for life. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8362.988s">I</a> mean ultimately a take-home vehicle would be only utilized for the purpose of going to your house and from your house and when you get home you're going to get into your own private vehicle so tracking this mileage is very important I think for us in this community to be sure that our fleets are being maintained in the proper and most satisfaction in the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8378.742s">also</a> take on vehicles to present tax implications, if I'm not mistaken, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8384.287s">So</a> these are things that we need to take a look at and be sure that we're complying with all standards of our federal state statute as well going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8391.113s">So</a> that's why I raised the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8392.114s">It's</a> something that seemed important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8393.896s">It</a> doesn't seem too important to many of you, but I certainly think that asking that a city <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8401.411s">vehicle</a> isn't something that's too much to ask, and that we track where these vehicles are going when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, and that we track the mileage on these vehicles when they're outside of city limits, outside of working hours isn't too much to ask, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8415.297s">So</a> that's the basis of the ordinance, and I ask for my council colleagues to support sending this to subcommittees so that we can have a further discussion with our future legal counsel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8443.284s">It's</a> up to you guys, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8445.305s">It's</a> an ordinance, so it probably should be fitting to go to that subcommittee, but if it wants to go to public safety, or if it wants to go to, I do believe there was a request prior to put together a subcommittee on legal services and litigation that we're still waiting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=8458.288s">It</a> could go there once that gets created, but whatever it is that you see fit, council, if it has any divine wisdom, I'd be happy to support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9151.481s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9153.183s">I</a> think Councilor Scarpelli is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9155.885s">Things</a> at Tufts University aren't very different than things at City Hall when it comes to labor relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9164.551s">The</a> only difference is our friends at Tufts University have the power to strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9170.936s">And</a> that's what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9171.716s">And</a> I commend them for taking the steps that they see necessary to ensure that they secure a fair collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9178.425s">I</a> support their right to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9180.286s">I</a> support any group's right to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9186.288s">I</a> do feel as though Tufts University this evening has been given a very bad rap. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9194.51s">And</a> I, in no uncertain terms, agree with the way that Tufts University is handling this issue with their RAs. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9206.716s">Nor</a> do I agree with their position on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9209.718s">However,</a> they've been taking a pretty good beating this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9214.18s">And</a> I think it's important that we point out there are many benefits that do come with being host to a university. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9223.906s">One</a> is prestigious as such university. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9228.308s">We</a> keep talking about the fact that they don't pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9231.85s">That's</a> patently false. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9234.472s">They</a> don't pay taxes on a portion of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9237.631s">And</a> they've entered into an agreement voluntarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9242.254s">But</a> they've said that they will continue to pay property taxes on newly purchased properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9247.257s">And</a> this has been going on for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9251.18s">So</a> Tufts University is not the villain that we make them out to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9254.782s">Do</a> problems come along with having Tufts University in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9259.265s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9260.826s">Every</a> problem in every community stems from something. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9265.148s">Tufts</a> is not a villain. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9266.647s">when</a> we look at the benefits that they bring to our community, like diversity, like economic stability during unstable and poor economic times, or like the community of academics that tend to call Medford their home after being employed at one of the most prestigious universities in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9292.987s">So,</a> Madam President, I can understand that being a good neighbor is one thing, but I think that they've always been a good partner, they've always lent a listening ear, and they've always invested in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9305.019s">Whether</a> or not you feel as though they're giving enough is one thing, but they always have been some of us willing to come to the table and sit down with us, and I think that that's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9314.969s">I</a> just wish that Clemson University took that same approach with their RAs and was willing to sit down with them at the table and put this issue behind them and reach a fair collective bargaining agreement for all involved so that we can move on because ultimately the ones that get affected the most are the students and the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9330.157s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, these parents are making a $70,000 investment <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9335.488s">for</a> the kids to worry about whether or not their IRAs are gonna have a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9340.07s">So</a> we need Tufts to get back to the table and negotiate this, because these Tufts students are residents of Metro, and the IRAs are residents of Metro, and they deserve our support. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9349.433s">I</a> support the people of Iowa. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9350.853s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9452.689s">It's</a> in the direct rebuttal to the statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9458.39s">I</a> just know I just don't want I don't want you to think that I'm saying the firefighters should go on strike or that I support that or that number or number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9465.862s">that</a> the firefighters would even consider that because I think we've heard time and time again the firefighters come up here and say all we want to do is keep Medford safe and we're going to continue to come to work no matter what and we're going to fight to do that and we're going to fight for fair wages in the meantime and if it takes 800 to 900 days we're not going to lie down but we're going to still continue to come to work today and I don't so I don't I don't think the firefighters would support the statement of saying we're going to go on strike. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9488.809s">And</a> I don't want anybody to think that that's what I was intending to say, or intended to say that they should do, because I don't speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9495.715s">So</a> I just don't want to be misconstrued or misinterpreted in saying that I think the firefighters should go on strike, or that I think the firefighters would go on strike if they have the power, because I can't speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9504.403s">But</a> from what I've heard and from my conversations with them, these men and women will come to work every day to make sure this community is safe, and they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9512.129s">and</a> they will continue to do so, and I don't see them ever, ever, ever taking a position where they take a strike action against the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9518.151s">They'll</a> continue to fight for fair wages in the proper format, but I don't ever see them doing something illegal in order to jeopardize the safety of the residents in this community, nor would I condone it, nor do I think they would. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9529.834s">So</a> thank you, Madam President, for allowing me the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9532.235s">I</a> just wanted to be very clear in my words, and I didn't want to get them misconstrued, because sometimes that happens over social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9539.84s">virtual</a> Zoom stuff, not social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9542.543s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9732.47s">Don't</a> activate me, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EwoILHnJVI8&t=9825.322s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=416.638s">Excuse</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=417.098s">These</a> are mandatory topics of bargaining, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=420.301s">Yeah,</a> so you guys should be taking care of this at the table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=428.862s">You</a> guys need to enact your rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=431.343s">I</a> mean, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=432.703s">You</a> have rights under the- I don't get it, though.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.164s">Amy,</a> time out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=438.944s">Time</a> out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=439.444s">We're</a> not the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=440.264s">We</a> don't negotiate contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=441.344s">That's</a> the job of the chief of staff per ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=443.605s">All</a> right, now, I haven't seen the chief of staff in a contract negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.105s">That's</a> a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=446.985s">We</a> have KP Law doing that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=459.096s">Yeah,</a> I agree with you there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=461.059s">But</a> these are mandatory topics of bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=462.741s">So</a> when the administration is, you know, depleting the number of membership, the number of <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=470.754s">employees</a> that are in the membership, you have to look at the work that's being performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=473.696s">And</a> if the work that's being performed by an employee that's actually union workers, not in the union, they didn't bring the city up on charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=479.52s">You</a> know, we've seen time and time again in this community, the level of respect that's given to organized labor by this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=486.024s">All</a> right, and it's lacking, it's lacking and never before and I mean, I've worked in local government now for <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=491.727s">Shoot,</a> since 1999, I represented union workers all across the Commonwealth from Worcester County to Springfield and back, all right, state, local. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=499.971s">And</a> I've never seen anything like this before, where employees are treated like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=503.693s">And,</a> you know, I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=507.367s">I'm</a> afraid for you for being up here right now, tonight and speaking out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=510.528s">I'm</a> afraid for you right now from being up here and speaking out tonight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=526.515s">And</a> the reason I say I'm scared for you right now is because I could go down a list of people <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=530.78s">have</a> got they've gotten rid of come up here to this microphone and they've spoken out against some injustice, the councils agree with them, and those people are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=537.443s">So</a> we look at Brian Karen's Mike for ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=540.004s">Mike</a> Durham, Aleesha Nunley, Molly kibbe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=543.146s">That's</a> five people, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=544.386s">That's</a> five people, five people with families, five people who need health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=549.429s">Five</a> people that committed to work for this community that came up here and spoke on behalf of the people and the taxpayers and the world let go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=555.441s">I</a> applaud you for your courage, Amy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=556.682s">I</a> do applaud you for the courage that you have for coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=558.924s">I</a> think a lot of this stuff really is mandatory topics of bargaining and mandatory topics of negotiation that need to be addressed at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=564.368s">I</a> agree with you that the actions of this body and the vote that some people take, given these people raises, there's no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=569.812s">The</a> council needs to fund this, the mayor needs to propose it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=571.714s">And</a> the mayor did propose a significant pay hike for a number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=575.617s">What's</a> the number councilor Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=576.698s">I</a> believe it was 16 requests have been made so far for reclassification of positions and the council is- 18, we rejected 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=583.543s">18,</a> we rejected 16.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=596.614s">I</a> hear you, and you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=598.796s">When</a> nobody listens to us at this meeting, tonight's the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=602.359s">It's</a> our go-to, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=604.041s">Because</a> for a year, we've been sitting there, and we've been saying that we need certain tools in the toolbox to do a job for these people in this community, including you, including the workers in the city hall, and we haven't been given them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=613.049s">We</a> haven't been given the tools that we need to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=615.11s">And</a> tonight is gonna be a day of reckoning because I don't think there's anybody behind this rail based upon the debates that I've listened to that's happy with the direction that this community is going in, that's happy with the way that we've been treated, that's happy with the way employees have been treated in this community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=627.816s">And</a> I think that's safe to say, nobody behind this rail based upon the commentary and the minutes that have been approved by this body, that nobody behind this rail is happy with the direction this community is going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=636.9s">All</a> right, so think about how frustrated you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=638.501s">Now</a> think about how frustrated we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=640.842s">We're</a> the last stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=642.024s">You</a> come to us for help and we can't get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=644.788s">The</a> only time we can get answers is from January 1st to, you know, maybe, maybe, sorry, June 1st to June 31st, June 30th, you know, right at the, right at the close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=653.801s">That's</a> when we get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=656.172s">Hi,</a> Camilla. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=657.572s">Good,</a> good to see you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=769.226s">Well,</a> here's the problem, Camilla. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=770.447s">I</a> mean, ultimately, you want to time out point of information, you ask the question, let me answer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=775.85s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=776.05s">So</a> you want to know where you can go and where you can turn, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=778.052s">I'd</a> say I'd say turn to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=780.373s">But</a> we don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=781.554s">We</a> have no we have nobody in the law department that's here represent the interest of the taxpayers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=934.246s">Well,</a> Amy, I think that's inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=937.41s">The</a> raises that have been, the raises that you're referring to have already been passed and they've already been funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=942.457s">So</a> regardless of whether or not this budget passed, these pay scales established by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=947.731s">everything</a> except for I think Mary's position, the one that you referred to, because that hasn't been passed by ordinance and the human resources position that they keep ignoring us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=955.795s">But</a> ultimately, these classifications for non-union titles and the cost of living adjustment that's attached there too, was passed by this body, not unanimously, but it was passed by this body and it was funded by this body.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=981.371s">Right,</a> but you have the power to negotiate in these non-union policies.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1007.591s">So</a> just a question so the negotiations between the clerical union and the administration I'm going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1014.966s">Really,</a> no, I'm just thinking back to when the mayor put her budget presentation on opening night, and she said how great negotiations are going with all the negotiations and how close they were to settle.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1286.282s">Amy,</a> the council did also in that proposal that was given to us, the mayor didn't tell us what classifications were included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1291.865s">And</a> then when we did an investigation and we looked into it, we found that the executive was included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1297.187s">The</a> mayor proposed a raise for herself in that proposal and we cut that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1301.109s">And</a> the mayor had also proposed a raise for the council and we cut that raise out as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1305.071s">You</a> know what I mean, to stand by what we've said that you know what I mean, rising tide floats all ships and we think that you guys should go so...
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1324.408s">Again,</a> these are cost of living adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1325.889s">They're</a> not performance-based.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1329.049s">Right,</a> but you're in a union, so you gotta negotiate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1331.43s">They</a> don't, you know, you have a collective bargaining.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1707.119s">And</a> I just want to just be on that point we did that last year Amy we did that at what one o'clock in the morning the mayor came up here in the magic money tree in her that grows in her office she shook it bunch of money fell out of it next thing you know we were going to get a lawyer that was going to come and help us out with zoning never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1720.783s">What</a> else we're going to get out of that deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1723.104s">City</a> solicitor yeah assistant city solicitor the city council, never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1726.885s">Well,</a> it's something else was supposed to come out of that too I think but you know what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1729.946s">And</a> then the way that they were going to fund all of these promises that they made to the council was they were going to take the money out of the negotiated salaries account, which is the account that they use to fund your raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1737.873s">And</a> this council said, no, you're not taking the money out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1740.775s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1741.115s">So</a> if you want to find magic money, you better find it somewhere else because you're not balancing this budget on the back of the working people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1746.84s">And</a> the mayor went and took the money out of the public utility account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=1749.382s">So</a> now we look at the transfers that are on the agenda this evening, we'll see hundreds of thousands of dollars in transfers so that we can pay to keep the lights on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2595.906s">I'm</a> just a little confused as to what leads us to mediation, because usually you go to mediation when you no longer can sit at the table anymore and make any forward progress, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2604.671s">So</a> mediation means you're at a stalemate at this point in time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2608.032s">You've</a> reached what's called an impasse, is the negotiating term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2611.514s">You've</a> reached an impasse in negotiations, and we can no longer move further or backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2615.836s">So</a> my question is, if you're working with these unions and these employee groups, how have we gotten to a point where at impasse with multiple groups, if in fact we are working with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2624.684s">Because</a> it doesn't make sense to me if we're going to mediation to a third party negotiator, a third party to handle our negotiations, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2630.928s">Outside</a> person, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2633.609s">Through</a> mediation because we reached impasse, that doesn't sound to me like the definition of working together with somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2638.292s">So</a> I'd just like to get a response from the chief of staff because she always likes to answer questions and provide points of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2643.755s">So</a> I'd like to ask the chief of staff, what got us to this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2646.137s">Why</a> are we at a point of impasse when these contracts have been open now since this administration got elected?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2702.302s">My</a> question is this, is Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan an employee organization? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.104s">they're</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2706.584s">And</a> Feinberg, Dumont, and Brennan is a law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2708.966s">They're</a> a law office that also works with Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2710.767s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2711.867s">So</a> the way that this works is if you're going to decertify from a union, they're a member of the SEIU and they want to decertify. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2716.97s">You</a> can't decertify when your contract is active. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2719.772s">So</a> what happens was the union said, we're going to decertify from SEIU. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2723.614s">And</a> they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2724.174s">And</a> they picked up private representation because there's a cooling off period that's necessary before they can apply with another union. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2730.41s">But</a> nothing precluded them from going to the table and negotiating once they decertified from SEIU and once that contract was open.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2755.315s">Madam</a> President, I just like to know what the timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2759.636s">I</a> just like to know what the timeline is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2760.716s">I'm</a> just asking a question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2874.104s">point</a> of information that men present. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2875.906s">I</a> do believe the council asked for a legal opinion as to whether or not that paper was posed with an and sound ethical footing, because what happened was the mayor asked the council to actually approve its own raise and erase for herself in the same year that they perceive it, we never received a response to that so if Nina could follow up on that, that would be good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2898.048s">question</a> Madam President on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2899.609s">Can</a> you just tell me who represents the city in the collective bargaining sessions can the chief of staff tell you who represents the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2909.633s">Yeah,</a> yeah, whoever that's her name Yeah, that'd be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2914.715s">Who</a> represents who represents the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2936.576s">And</a> just on that note, Madam President, the administration's well aware of city ordinance section 2-680. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2944.281s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2946.742s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2947.283s">And</a> part of that ordinance does read that the chief of staff shall be responsible for representing the mayor and I'll collect the bargaining sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2955.973s">Is</a> the Chief of Staff employed by KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2960.681s">Is</a> the Chief of Staff KP Law?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=2996.849s">Madam</a> President, on that point, the Chief of Staff is wrong in her reading of the ordinance because that was not the legislative intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3005.031s">And</a> I can speak to that personally because I voted for it in 2016 when it came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3010.133s">I</a> was a part of this body at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3014.215s">So</a> a reading of it is incorrect and is not in line with the legislative intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3017.877s">And</a> I think that any other member of this council that was on the body in 2016 can also concur with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3022.5s">All</a> right, so the way I'm looking at this now is we have an essential function and essential duty of the chief of staff that's been taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3030.125s">The</a> salary is still $135,000, but an essential function, essential duty has been taken away and it's been farmed out to a third party, private third party law firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3039.602s">That's</a> an expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3041.043s">So</a> when we sit down and we talk about why the council needs a city solicitor, it's to control these expenses and these wasteful spending habits that this administration has. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3049.766s">So</a> when we look at the chief of staff's title in the ordinance that supports the job that you're supposed to do, and we'll go through it, the majority of the duties have been taken away, but yet the salary remains the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3063.612s">So</a> when I hear members of our clerical union get up here and quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3069.758s">properly</a> express dissatisfaction and disgust because they've been out of the contract for 48 months and then listen to the chief of staff come up here and try to explain our way out of the fact that it's because they're not able to sit down at the table and negotiate properly and then try to spin it by saying that they're precluded from doing it when I know for a fact they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3089.488s">It's</a> just bizarre to me, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3091.009s">And</a> I feel like what it is is it's for the cameras and it's not for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3095.311s">And</a> it's to portray a picture and control a narrative that's not a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3100.08s">So</a> that's where I am with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3101.421s">I</a> thank the chief of staff and president of the clerical union, Mr. Naglia, for being up here this evening and sharing with us their insight on such an important topic in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3113.247s">And</a> I am going to what I'd call use my reasonable deduction to determine who's being more truthful than not.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3735.799s">I</a> just like to join Council Scarpelli and offer my condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3739.001s">Although</a> I didn't know Fred, as well as George that I do remember him from a very young age, when I was involved in Methodist soccer, and I also had the opportunity to go to college with the sun Steve, and what a good kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3753.309s">Freddie</a> Rita was just a nice guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3754.529s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3755.229s">George</a> hit the nail right on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3756.89s">He</a> was someone that wasn't afraid to put himself, put the community before himself and put himself out there to do the work, roll up his sleeves, get dirty and not seek an ounce of credit for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3767.574s">He</a> was a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3768.795s">Like</a> you said, great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=3770.195s">And</a> I joined my council colleague and extending my deep condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4447.863s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4449.124s">Was</a> the mailing done, Madam President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4469.541s">How</a> far out did those notices go? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4470.922s">I</a> know Mayor Longo, when she was a council, wanted to expand it to like 11 miles from where they were doing the project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4491.921s">It</a> was 300 feet by law and then Mayor Lungo when she was a councilor wanted to expand that I think to 1000 or 600 or something like that and then it got passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4503.248s">But</a> then I don't think it's been a practice.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4505.769s">Administration</a> change.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4533.383s">And</a> then I just have one more question, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4536.186s">The</a> process that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4540.349s">Evans</a> has outlined this evening, has that been reviewed by legal and been approved by legal as the proper way to enact such a measure that's before the body this evening?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4562.415s">What</a> I'm hearing is, you know, based upon a new zoning, the city council is not required to do this, this, this and this and now we have a special permit granting authority pursuant to this and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4571.297s">This</a> is the first time we've seen one of these papers before us where we're the site plan review granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4576.919s">So</a> my question was whether or not this procedural aspect was reviewed by legal counsel to ensure that we're in compliance with our own ordinance that we draft
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4600.463s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4601.044s">So</a> the council approved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4602.205s">Now,</a> we have a process that's in place as this process been reviewed by legal to ensure that it complies with what we put together.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4643.624s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4644.024s">And</a> what I'm doing is asking whether or not because the council hasn't seen one of these and so many things have come through in so many years that this process that's being established now for the first time in so many years is legally sound.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4662.293s">Okay</a> and we've conferred with him and he says this is the way we do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4670.156s">So</a> no we haven't conferred with legal as to whether or not this is the way that we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=4677.857s">and</a> said this is the process that we're going to do I have we not I don't know why every question we ask, it's a yes or no question gets 6,000 different answers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5294.326s">Point</a> of information, Madam President, before he starts, I just want to go back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5297.388s">So</a> Attorney Desmond, the proposal is that all your deliveries are going to take place between 12 o'clock and 9 1 o'clock in the morning in a in a location that abuts a residential neighborhood between 11 to 12 for Sunday through Thursday and not every evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5317.097s">It's</a> not working out so great, though.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5353.613s">And</a> when you went before the CD board this proposal of eliminating the loading dock and then telling them that you're going to apply for a special permit before us to have the loading take place after hours was presented to them in that fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5367.318s">It</a> was, and that was something that they supported.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5488.67s">Does</a> the applicant intend to apply for a license for an illuminated light or permit for an illuminated light sign?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5511.764s">I'm</a> assuming you'd want the light to light up if you guys want to be open to one o'clock in the morning on the weekends, you don't want people driving by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5516.871s">Yeah,</a> but there's also houses across the street, people that live there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5596.729s">Are</a> there any new curb cuts that will be made from either Riverside Ave or the Fellsway to gain access to the property as part of the site plan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5605.552s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5740.192s">So,</a> what you're telling me is that you're going to guarantee that these trucks that are delivering are going to follow this route every single time that they come here at 12 o'clock at night, three times a week or four times a week that they do it from now until the end of time as long as we have this permit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5866.943s">Because</a> you did say they were going to be coming from Taunton, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5869.745s">So</a> it's guaranteed their first stop is Medford every time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5873.108s">Because</a> they're coming from, I mean, those are the variables that I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5876.19s">It's</a> like, there's no way we can guarantee that they're going to take the same route every time and go in there the same way every time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5923.606s">And</a> then you spoke about a couple of other Raising Canes that have very similar patterns, I guess, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5928.551s">So</a> is it their model that they don't have loading docks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5932.414s">Any</a> of that sort?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=5939.321s">I</a> don't care about out of state just yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6002.888s">I</a> mean, they're efficient plans for the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6005.54s">But</a> there might not be efficient plans for the residents that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6008.422s">And</a> I think that's the number one concern right is the abundance right the people live across the street we have residents on Riverside we have residents across middle sector residents on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6016.646s">And</a> that's where I'm coming from on this but I appreciate it I'm not gonna keep saying we got residents live across the street I think you get it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6345.923s">Just</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6347.785s">Estimated</a> number of vehicle trips per day to the store? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6351.009s">Per</a> day? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6352.19s">No,</a> per week or whatever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6353.331s">I</a> can do math.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6467.486s">Based</a> upon my math, that's like an average hour, we're looking at 1.8 to 1.9 vehicles in and out every hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6479.129s">I'm</a> sorry, every minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6480.809s">Every</a> minute, every minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6482.689s">1.9</a> every minute.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=6486.75s">Yeah,</a> 114 divided by.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9891.985s">Does</a> that fall in the parameters of 41 a 65 days right from when we receive it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9904.329s">Yeah,</a> we keep the public hearing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9920.493s">I</a> think Councilor Bears might have some, he wants to say.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9958.779s">I</a> didn't make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9962.102s">All</a> I said was I don't want to wait the six day waiting period and I don't support voting on it until the six day waiting period is over.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=9993.084s">Suppose</a> Madam President, where it's a special permit, the special permit should go with the business and not with the address as well, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10065.39s">We</a> already have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10066.631s">I'm</a> not in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10067.971s">I'm</a> not putting any restrictions on it because I'm voting no.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10208.362s">Right,</a> so we can't put restrictions on a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10211.164s">Can</a> you put restrictions on site plan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10220.992s">Did</a> that come from Alicia or did that come from a lawyer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10223.614s">That</a> came from the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10230.053s">That's</a> why I asked the question initially, Madam President, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.116s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10233.617s">At</a> the end of the day, we need to make sure we're making decisions that are legally sound and strong footing and foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10239.382s">We</a> don't have that opportunity with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10241.625s">We</a> haven't had it for three years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10255.998s">At</a> this rate, Madam President, this thing will pass with a constructive passage because we'll never take a vote on it the way that this administration is with us when it comes to giving us legal opinions and legal advice and access to legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10267.963s">We</a> can't put this on the table pending a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10269.924s">We'll</a> never get one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10288.719s">I</a> mean, and we did it with BJ's too and then we got advice and then that advice ended up getting us taken to court again and then they called and said, what do you want us to do now? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10295.885s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10296.345s">It's</a> like, it's just a, it's a comedy of errors in terms of the representation that we received legally here in the community, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10302.629s">It</a> puts us at a very significant disadvantage when it comes to making issues, making decisions on issues like this that will have a vast impact on the quality of life of the people that are about us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10313.197s">All</a> right, so I don't blame Raising Cane's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10314.598s">I</a> thank Raising Cane's for coming here and wanting to invest in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10317.98s">All</a> right, but the problem that I have is that the administration's not providing us with the tools to make informed and well-sounded decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10323.784s">Okay,</a> so at the end of the day, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10325.665s">Who</a> suffers? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10326.546s">The</a> residents in this community, the taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10329.108s">Why</a> do they suffer? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10330.068s">Because</a> we're not able to make determinations that are going to impact things like growth, which is probably the most important thing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10335.712s">So</a> we get a letter that comes out, we get a newspaper article from the Boston Globe that says, you know, Medford's the fastest growing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10341.397s">It</a> can grow fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10342.898s">The</a> question is whether or not it's desirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10346.361s">Is</a> it a desirable place to live? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10348.583s">I</a> don't see Medford as being desirable right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10350.504s">It</a> might be growing fast, but I don't see it as desirable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10353.126s">And</a> part of the reason that I don't see it as desirable is because the elected officials in this community aren't treated with respect or given the tools that they need to do their job properly and ensure that the taxpayers' rights are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10364.215s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, when it comes down to this paper that's before us this evening, it's something that I can't support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10370.238s">You</a> know, we talk about economic development and growth here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10373.9s">We</a> had the opportunity to bring in a 300 plus million dollar development on Boston Ave, life science and biotech. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10381.184s">It</a> gets blown up by the administration, but we get chicken fingers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10384.125s">We</a> get chicken fingers, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10385.286s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10386.026s">So</a> that's the vision that we have in this community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10387.967s">That's</a> the vision that we have when it comes to economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10390.889s">Fast</a> food restaurants, nail salons, Dunkin' Donuts, banks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10394.568s">All</a> right, we don't create jobs that bring a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10398.153s">We</a> don't create jobs that provide health insurance for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10401.177s">When</a> we're looking at this job model here, this position, this entity that's coming before us here, the job that it's gonna create aren't gonna pay people a living wage, not gonna pay them enough money to live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10411.005s">I</a> have serious and significant concerns about a two-lane highway drive-through where people in flag waver outfits are going to be out there waving people through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10418.426s">I</a> have serious concerns about an illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10421.907s">I</a> have serious concerns about noise traffic and product drop-off, especially with the extended hours in an area that's abutting a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10430.308s">You</a> know, these are the reasons that I'm not going to support the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10434.429s">And</a> I thank you for inviting me and providing me the opportunity to explain my vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10479.64s">I'd</a> just like the record to reflect Madam President that all these votes this evening are being taken without the advice of legal counsel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10725.063s">Question,</a> Madam President, why wouldn't the same restrictions relative to the permit going with the business and the reviews be attached to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10733.03s">They</a> should be, yes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=10953.253s">I</a> just question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11341.367s">This</a> was something that was brought to my attention by the many retirees in the city of Medford after an alert was sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11347.114s">by</a> PARAC and the Massachusetts State Retirement Board, saying that the city of Medford hasn't fully funded its cost of living adjustment capabilities for the upcoming fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11357.119s">So</a> as we see in this ordinance, I'm sorry, in this resolution, Madam President, the Massachusetts State Legislature, in its divine wisdom, did allow municipalities the local option to increase the cost of living adjustment for retirees to 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11370.485s">It</a> allows us to add an additional 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11373.867s">Now,</a> when we look at the cost of living adjustment that was given to retirees this year, it's actually higher than the 2% standard that the administration has put in place and in effect as the standard cost of living adjustment for active employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11384.012s">However,</a> we do have an opportunity, Madam President, for us to take a leap forward and take care of some of the retirees, the people that worked here in this community for a number of years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11393.177s">that</a> made meant for the great place that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.117s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11395.838s">So</a> when I look at this paper, what the request is, is to ask the administration to send us the request so that we can approve this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11403.739s">There's</a> a two part process for which this needs to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11408.4s">And</a> the first is the retirement board and the second is the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11411.721s">So</a> I'm asking that the city administration, retirement board, which falls under the purview of the executive, takes the necessary steps to ensure that our retirees are taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11422.827s">We</a> hear a lot of people come up to these microphones and talk how much they value the employees and what a great job they do and how much they care about the community and how wonderful all these people were. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11430.975s">Well,</a> show it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11431.736s">Put</a> your money where your mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11434.091s">know,</a> I'm sure there'll be another narrative or another reason why this can't happen, Madam President, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11438.693s">And</a> it's probably going to be rooted in not logic or reality, but what's going to control the spin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11443.976s">But</a> ultimately, at the end of the day, this is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11446.697s">All</a> right, these people are on fixed incomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11449.018s">Okay,</a> many of them live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11451.759s">They're</a> all elderly, they've reached retirement age. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11453.92s">And</a> if they reach retirement age that means they've put in at least 10 years of employment and service to the general public and the taxpayers of this community and they deserve to be respected, and they deserve to be rewarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11463.867s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President asked my council colleagues to support this paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11714.073s">When</a> the elections manager was up here, they had put this on our agenda, and they had tried to make us vote to support the proposal that they put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11723.143s">But</a> they said that the council doesn't need to support this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11725.545s">They</a> were just putting us on there to make us aware of it, to put us in a position to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11729.91s">We</a> didn't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11731.171s">We</a> sent it back and we asked them to make those changes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11733.533s">So</a> now we need an official paper from them saying that the Elections Commission has made this policy change, send it back to us and put it on the agenda just like they did previously, unless they're not going to be transparent this time around, because they had to change their mind.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11798.188s">I'd</a> appreciate a waiver of the remaining of the reader I think we need some bottom line there at this point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11816.445s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11819.949s">This</a> evening we got, I believe our third and fourth budgets from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11825.195s">We</a> didn't get the I didn't see the press release that went out about how the administration's put out <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11829.059s">three</a> more budgets since the initial one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11831.301s">But,</a> you know, today at two o'clock, and again at six o'clock we got two additional budgets, right with updates or amendments or reallocations, and I'm wondering if the paper that before us this evening reflects those changes that have been made by the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11912.409s">Did</a> the mayor meet with any of the councils personally in our office to discuss this budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11917.274s">Or</a> on the telephone? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11918.575s">Or</a> you for that matter?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11922.679s">Did</a> you meet with any member of this elected body individually to discuss the budget?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11932.495s">It's</a> not a trick question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=11961.55s">So</a> these conversations were outside the scope of the public forum.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12029.508s">It's</a> on that point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12031.731s">So</a> I'm looking at this paper and it says that this was <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12034.537s">the</a> mayor's fiscal year budget amended on 6 14 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.318s">Today</a> 6 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12036.798s">We've</a> gotten two emails from you wanted six o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12041.519s">I</a> wanted two o'clock today that further amends the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12044.5s">So</a> what you're telling me now is that the paper that's before us that was amended on 6 15 reflects those amendments that you sent us on 6 20.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12139.565s">I</a> did I was just gonna say on that point in these other communities normally when financial data is requested from the legislative body they receive it they're not told that they can't get it even though the ordinance says it should be providing it that the book should be provided to the Council upon request, you know, so you know when we talk about what they do other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12156.797s">Let's</a> talk about the good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12158.478s">But</a> let's talk about the bad that we do here too because what other places do we don't do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12543.797s">So</a> why do we have a meeting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12633.989s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12634.809s">When</a> did the mayor determine that it was time to have a discussion?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12644.095s">Absent</a> a vote of the council?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12650.179s">Not</a> as the leadership team, as council of business noted earlier.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12660.015s">I'm</a> not trying to trip you up I'm just saying as the elected president I had the same issue with john Falco, and I got my ass kicked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12665.897s">But</a> I called him out on it, and I got a beating on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12667.918s">You</a> know what I mean, because I like the president to represent the interest of the body not the interest of yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12673.379s">So</a> when you get elected president of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12676.0s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12678.101s">different</a> responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12679.502s">You</a> have responsibility to the people buying this realtor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12682.064s">Now</a> you did what you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12683.204s">It</a> is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.105s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12684.605s">And</a> I know that you haven't been in the chair a long time, so I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12688.547s">I</a> get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.128s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12689.728s">But</a> ultimately, right, we're a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12692.31s">We're</a> a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12694.351s">We're</a> a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12695.111s">Now,</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12703.631s">We're</a> a body, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12704.732s">So</a> right now what I'm seeing happened is we have a budget that's before us that wasn't the budget that we got when the press releases went out saying this is the first time you ever got a budget, because it was a fake budget, because the school department never passed their aspect of it before it comes to us, which is the normal practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12719.584s">All</a> right, now we have an administration horse trading, horse trading outside the public sphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12727.315s">to</a> ensure passage of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12729.616s">The</a> same administration that runs on transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12733.598s">That's</a> not transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12735.579s">I</a> don't care what anybody says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12737.239s">It's</a> a classic divide and conquer strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12740.281s">A</a> classic divide and conquer strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12743.262s">So</a> the mayor for three years can fail to respond to the body public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12747.724s">Fail</a> to respond to the body public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12750.105s">Then</a> there's closed door deals with select Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12754.397s">And</a> other Councilors that are elected by the people of this community are excluded? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12763.282s">You</a> guys think you know about the open meeting law? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12765.283s">I'm</a> gonna tell you right now, I think you're teetering very close, very close to a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12770.326s">Just</a> because you weren't in the same room at the same time doesn't mean there wasn't deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12777.37s">I'm</a> not making that accusation, but what I'm saying is, perception is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12783.066s">So</a> the perception that I get right now is that the mayor picked up the phone, called a few people into her office, and cut a deal, left the rest of us hanging on the shelf. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12790.089s">So</a> we sat here, and we made votes, and we made speeches, and we made pledges, and we made commitments to the people in this community, to the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12800.822s">And</a> sometimes making hard decisions isn't politically expedient. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12804.905s">Sometimes</a> making hard decisions isn't politically popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12808.227s">But</a> people didn't elect us to take the easy road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12811.829s">People</a> didn't elect us to take the easy way out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12815.031s">So</a> we've sat here and we beat our chests about, oh, we're gonna protect everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12819.514s">We're</a> gonna get this, we're gonna get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12821.074s">We've</a> gotten nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12822.415s">This</a> administration's accomplished nothing other than recycling and regurgitating old plans from previous administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12829.394s">And</a> we're sitting here passing it like a rubber stamp, pot and parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12834.959s">Because</a> it's not about Medford, it's not about the community, it's about what we can get on the way through the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12845.368s">It's</a> a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12847.049s">It's</a> a disgrace and I'm disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12849.171s">For</a> the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12853.254s">I</a> love this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12854.295s">I've</a> loved this city my whole life, and I am embarrassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12857.738s">When</a> I go to neighboring towns and other communities, and I get people going, what the hell's going on with your city? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12861.581s">What's</a> going on with your mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12862.822s">What's</a> going on over there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12864.884s">And</a> we all say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12865.885s">I</a> know it's a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.446s">It's</a> a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12867.987s">I</a> hear every single person behind this rail say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12870.189s">I</a> know it's a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.41s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12871.89s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.29s">Oh,</a> it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12872.791s">It's</a> only going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12873.972s">Just</a> wait till next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12875.273s">And</a> here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12876.684s">Give</a> me the rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12878.407s">Let's</a> stamp it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12879.588s">I</a> got what I needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12880.83s">Someone</a> might've got a job out of the budget in the closed door deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12883.434s">I</a> don't know who got what. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12884.576s">All</a> I know is I got nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12886.661s">All</a> I know is I got nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12888.102s">Not</a> even the courtesy of a telephone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12890.284s">I</a> got a text message at 418. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12891.746s">I'm</a> not sure what time you guys met with the mayor, but I got a text message at 418 saying if I have any last minute questions on the budget, let me or Nina know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12899.672s">A</a> text. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12900.974s">A</a> text. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12901.954s">A</a> text message at four o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12903.636s">Two</a> hours before a meeting, we were talking about $180 million plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12908.54s">Enough's</a> enough with this clown show. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12910.922s">Madam</a> President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12912.482s">I'm</a> not supporting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12913.943s">I'm</a> not supporting the budget because I don't feel it's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12916.323s">I</a> don't feel as though it's an accurate depiction of the finances in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12919.544s">And</a> I don't feel as though it positions us for a future of growth and for a future of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12924.145s">All</a> right, our school department is going to fall apart next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12928.086s">We're</a> going to have to lay off 33 teachers because all of our SM money is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12930.946s">Nobody</a> cares about that, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.067s">You</a> know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12933.667s">It's</a> going to look good in the press releases this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12935.447s">It's</a> going to look good in the campaign material this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12938.728s">Time</a> in and time out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12941.138s">Time</a> in and time out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=12942.278s">What's</a> the number one rule of an elected official?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14742.701s">And</a> I want to finish my question, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14744.762s">Ultimately,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14745.863s">We've</a> been asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14747.103s">We've</a> been asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14748.464s">We've</a> been asking for financial documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14750.745s">for</a> two years and haven't gotten it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14752.086s">And</a> now here we are at the budget and you say no, that's a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.027s">Oh,</a> that's a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14755.887s">Maybe</a> if they shared this information with us that we've been asking for, as the conduit of communication per the city ordinance that the chief of staff was as a badge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14765.331s">Maybe</a> if some of this do you have a question for me? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.093s">Yeah,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14768.993s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14769.613s">How</a> is it that we're planning a budget based upon figures that are mistakes?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14776.175s">It's</a> all this is, you know, so, so, so, so, so, so when it comes to clear that sucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14785.382s">And</a> when it comes time for us to do our research, we know clear that's not good so we asked for the information and we don't get the information, but then we're expected to make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14792.887s">And</a> then when it comes down to us actually sitting down and having a transparent discussion, the mayor doesn't divide and conquer strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14799.432s">You</a> know, so that's where we're at in this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14801.555s">This</a> is a joke.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14926.391s">Let's</a> just look at the law department as an example, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14929.851s">Now,</a> we haven't had a city solicitor or an assistant city solicitor for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14934.312s">Last</a> year, we budgeted what, about $422,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14938.902s">We</a> still don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14940.142s">We</a> still don't have an assistant city solicitor, yet the department's budget goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14944.503s">How</a> does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14945.284s">There's</a> nobody even in the office, but the department's budget is going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14948.604s">There's</a> no employees there except for Janice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14951.605s">There's</a> one person in the office, but the budget goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14954.026s">How</a> is that possible if the positions are vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14956.886s">I</a> don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because the person that comes in should be starting at step one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14960.987s">So</a> I don't wanna hear we pass the COLA, because that's just another way to control a false narrative.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14968.769s">Okay,</a> why are we giving the city solicitor a raise when the position is vacant? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14971.834s">Why</a> is the budget in this the law office going up when the two positions that have funded through the vacant?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=14980.146s">Yeah,</a> please don't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15111.205s">Okay,</a> and didn't we not have vacancies in the finance director's position during that period of time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15123.955s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15422.428s">Madam</a> President, can you repeat that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15424.769s">Instead</a> of taking votes as a body, we want us to email... No, you said you want us to email them individually instead of taking votes as a body and raising the issue with the body public? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=15437.096s">And</a> not discuss them, yeah?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16201.268s">It</a> was never shame on you shame on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16204.971s">Madam</a> President ultimately right we talked about this is this is a communication issue right more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16210.234s">It's</a> a communication issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16211.135s">Would</a> everybody agree this is a communication issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.016s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.576s">Everybody.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16213.917s">So</a> who's responsible for communication from the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16217.853s">Anybody,</a> anybody know who's responsible for the communications from the mayor's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16220.975s">Who</a> went from the mayor's office? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16222.136s">Anybody?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16223.236s">No,</a> it's not the communications director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16225.378s">It's</a> not the COVID specialist, communication specialist or the other two people they got in that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16230.361s">According</a> to the city ordinances, there shall be a chief of staff of policy appointed by the mayor whose duty shall include managing communication and information both to and from the office of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16242.929s">So</a> we talk about some of the problems that we have in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16247.91s">A</a> lot of it lies in the application of the ordinances and the incumbents interpretation thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16261.38s">So</a> when I sit here and I look at a lot of the problems that happen in this community, and I think about the things we get we get all upset about KP law, one of the biggest things we get upset about right, let's read the city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16271.888s">Let's</a> read what the city ordinance says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16274.15s">Okay,</a> about an assistant city solicitor, because the city ordinance says that the mayor may appoint an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16282.856s">Now,</a> can anybody tell me in last year's budget what the assistant city solicitor was? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16286.559s">I</a> believe it was $422,000 was the legal department's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16289.761s">And</a> our city ordinance says that the administration can't spend more than has been appropriated for the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16297.086s">But</a> we have correspondence from this administration saying they spent $450,000 on KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16302.452s">which</a> exceeds the 422,000 in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16307.216s">Whether</a> or not that information is presented to us now as accurate is in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16312.501s">But</a> ultimately there's a significant misapplication of the city ordinances in terms of the way that the city is supposed to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16320.768s">The</a> first of which being there shall be a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16323.891s">Well,</a> there isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16324.812s">There</a> shall be one, there has to be one, there isn't one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16330.145s">Then</a> there are controls put in place through city ordinance to prevent wild and uncontrolled spending like what's going on with KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16337.768s">And</a> we don't abide by that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16342.63s">But</a> to ensure that we are complying with it, we don't have the financial data before us to allow us to make that determination as to whether or not we're in compliance with our local ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16355.795s">Last</a> time we raised an issue about an ordinance, the mayor said, well, the city council can just change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16360.563s">Last</a> time we raised an issue about process, the chief of staff said, we'll just do it under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16366.106s">This</a> is the same administration that ran on transparency, the same administration that ran on community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16375.33s">Okay,</a> so when we sit here yelling and screaming at each other, let's understand, we're not the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16385.074s">Us</a> in this circle behind this rail are not the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16389.121s">You</a> know what we are? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16390.161s">We're</a> frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16391.342s">You</a> know why we're frustrated? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16392.442s">Because</a> we've been putting a plastic bag and we've been trying to punch our way out for the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16399.025s">That's</a> why. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16400.466s">So</a> we got Zach and George getting frustrated at each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.487s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16403.767s">Because</a> of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16407.629s">Nicole</a> and I becoming very good friends through this whole entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.371s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16411.591s">Because</a> of the shared concerns and values that we have with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16417.056s">Doesn't</a> look that way, but that's really what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16420.3s">That's</a> the fact and the reality behind the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16423.383s">Now,</a> some of us speak a little bit more passionately than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16426.406s">Some</a> of us have been around a little bit longer than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16428.849s">So</a> some of us have a level of frustration that's a lot higher than other people's. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16433.714s">Some</a> of us have also had the experience of putting up with what I call a BS meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16438.499s">We</a> all have a BS meter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16439.66s">We</a> can all smell it from a mile away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16441.242s">Some</a> of us are better at smelling it than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16443.284s">Some</a> of us allow people to have a little bit more leeway when it comes to wafting their BS around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16447.888s">I'm</a> not one of those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.29s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16449.69s">I'm</a> not going to sit here and waste my time listening to BS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16452.673s">That's</a> not what I'm here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16454.034s">I'm</a> here to make good decisions on behalf of the taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16457.758s">And</a> I can't do that because this administration is fearless. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16461.889s">So</a> we sit here and we infight and we argue and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16464.83s">We</a> all want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16467.071s">We</a> want the respect that we deserve from this administration so that we can do the job that the people in this community elected us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16474.014s">And</a> we can't do it based upon the tools, the resources, the processes, and the procedures that this administration has implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16481.437s">And</a> week in and week out, we express these frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16483.918s">And</a> week in and week in, we beat our chest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16486.616s">And</a> week in and week out, nothing changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16488.537s">Everything</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16490.518s">Everything</a> stays the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16491.479s">And</a> how do you make things stay the same? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16493.22s">By</a> doing things like divide and conquer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16495.421s">By</a> doing things like cutting back on deals and making promises you're not gonna keep. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16501.705s">By</a> sending out press releases that control narratives that aren't true, but control the spin because there's no local media in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16509.548s">Those</a> are the realities of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16511.989s">That's</a> what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16512.83s">And</a> these are the hurdles that we face as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16515.812s">But</a> for people who are watching this or people that are sitting in the audience saying, Jesus, these people are nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16520.114s">What</a> the hell is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16521.575s">We</a> all want the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16523.096s">We're</a> just mad because they're not giving it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16526.598s">That's</a> what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16528.499s">Everybody</a> on this side of the rail shares the same value. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16533.261s">They</a> wanna make Medford a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16536.223s">Everyone</a> on this side of the rail has been asking for the tools to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16540.776s">There's</a> only one common denominator and one common thread. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16547.842s">One</a> hurdle, one reason that we haven't been provided with the tools that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16554.127s">And</a> it comes from across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16556.289s">And</a> let's not forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16557.87s">Because</a> at the end of this meeting, we're all gonna leave, we're all gonna be pissed off at each other and everything else for no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16563.475s">Because</a> this is what the administration wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16566.157s">This</a> is the method that they created to divide a wedge between us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16571.189s">to</a> make it so that this body can't be effective and that they can continue to move with reckless and abandoned and lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16579.096s">And</a> it hurts the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16580.257s">It</a> hurts the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16583.961s">It</a> hurts the process and it makes people distrustful of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16588.965s">When</a> people distrust government, they don't participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16591.848s">And</a> when people don't participate, then government operates in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16597.176s">We</a> have an administration that already said they throw a third of the voters off of active roles every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16603.459s">When</a> you're taking off the active roles, you know what you don't get in the mail? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16607.98s">Literature</a> from candidates that are running from office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16611.122s">Wow,</a> imagine that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16612.382s">Now</a> you're misinformed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16614.023s">You're</a> an inactive voter that's misinformed, but you're expected to come out to the polls and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16619.205s">Let's</a> think about what's going on here, folks, because we're not the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16622.526s">And</a> we sound like we are, and we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16625.868s">We</a> aren't the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=16628.579s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17114.321s">So</a> move on a president provided that I could get a question answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17117.003s">Historically,</a> historically, the administration has presented us with this $500,000 request after the rates have been established after the budget's been passed and it's been used for rate relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17128.792s">Is</a> that going to be the current philosophy behind the expenditure of this plane that's in this paper this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17157.747s">Yeah,</a> I mean every year we get a bill of paper for $500,000 that asks us to offset the rates to the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17164.252s">to</a> the ratepayers for water and sewer through the retained earnings account is this going to be is that's this is this that same 500,000 or is this a different 500,000 or is this something that we're not going to see this year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17180.924s">So</a> they haven't set the rates yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17184.386s">I</a> get $500,000 in rate relief if they do when they do, but we don't know what the rates are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17189.19s">I</a> think the motion itself would make sense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17255.138s">Section</a> 22.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17259.519s">First</a> time in financial reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17261.46s">Paper</a> can be passed in one evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17326.083s">We're</a> transferring X amount of dollars from surplus to deficit to balance the budget, I'm sure, is what he's going to say, something along those lines.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17346.305s">So</a> certain accounts run a deficit and certain accounts have a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17349.367s">And</a> what we're doing is the bottom line remains the same and all we're doing is evening out the accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17353.29s">So</a> that makes accounting easy, but at the end of the day, the bottom line hasn't changed, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17504.633s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17506.254s">First</a> off, this is a good paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17507.795s">It's</a> a paper that I actually filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17509.516s">This</a> is a paper that I introduced a number of years ago under the Burke administration, and I'm glad to see that the administration has moved on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17516.7s">I'd</a> like to have a committee of the whole paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17519.081s">I've</a> seen this community do just fine in previous years without a stabilization fund and to think that if we don't establish this this immediate second and appropriate $5 million into it that the city is going to fail, I think is a little bit more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17534.93s">a</a> fear-mongering approach than it is actually the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17538.652s">So</a> in looking at this, you know, the city's been able to survive for all these years without a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17543.975s">I</a> think we should sit down and we should talk about it a little bit more and define parameters around the stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17548.557s">I</a> know state law dictates a lot of what we can and can't do, but I think it would be nice to codify that and to establish a process and a procedure very much like the better budget plan that's been put out to amend that charter, Madam President, the procedure and a process that makes it transparent and make sure that everybody knows what to understand and how to understand it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17706.407s">Sounds</a> like it's a pretty big deal, Madam President, and it's 5 million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17711.129s">We're</a> not gonna have a meeting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17713.783s">been</a> recommended by auditors, been recommended by bond council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17716.985s">It's</a> necessary for us to keep our A plus rating and it's a $5 million appropriation and we're not gonna have a meeting on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17752.426s">You're</a> making it sound like they're going to be able to get bond council there at the auditor there and everybody else there in 10 days notice and I don't see that happening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17786.655s">Bond</a> Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17792.357s">And</a> ultimately, is there anything that precludes this community from bringing this paper forward between now and March? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17801.897s">while</a> our free cash is being certified, knowing that we have more than $5 million in our free cash already. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17808.642s">What</a> precludes us from creating this in 90 days or 60 days, but before March? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17814.086s">I'm</a> just asking.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17870.111s">It</a> just needs to be recertified, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17888.763s">We</a> just passed like a $200 million budget, didn't we?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17904.939s">Yes,</a> which- We can establish a stabilization fund and not fund it, and then wait for the free cash to be certified, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17912.982s">We</a> could go through a legislative process and create actual legislation instead of doing this at the 11th hour and making a $5 million appropriation on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17920.947s">You</a> know, I think we're putting the horse behind the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17923.748s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17924.369s">It's</a> like, if we're going to create a process, let's create the process and let's go through the legislative process and create it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17929.492s">Let's</a> not throw $5 million into an account and then say figure the rest of that out later.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17939.094s">It's</a> like we're creating it and funding it in the same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17941.338s">Why</a> don't we create it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17963.04s">Does</a> it take a super majority to create it or a super majority to withdraw from it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17966.201s">Both.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wef-EghTWAc&t=17996.159s">I'm</a> not sure what to say beyond that we've been on the floor for that amount of committee papers still in the paper now the paper is disposed of by being voted into committee.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA/2024-10-05_GqBzZH7qLmA.html">City Council 06-06-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=775.727s">Madam</a> President, I'd advise against it on a matter that's as significant as enough as our charter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=782.271s">Waving</a> the comment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=806.808s">Yes,</a> no, I mean, no, no, no, no.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=993.412s">Motion</a> to waive the reading.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2591.868s">I'm</a> just, I'm not sure if I heard councilor Scarpelli right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2594.91s">Is</a> he saying that the staff of the mayor who came up here and said that she's holding people accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2601.915s">is</a> scared to come before this council and be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2605.218s">That's</a> what it sounds like to me Council Scarpelli is that they're scared to come before the city council and be held accountable, but the mayor comes up here and beats her chest, saying how she's holding people accountable when she's getting dragged out of here and handcuffs and making them undergo psychological evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2618.248s">So</a> I'm a little concerned about that and I thank the council for bringing that up and that's a very good point, but I know, and I'll end with this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2943.102s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2944.143s">I</a> don't think that the engineer is the bad guy in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2946.845s">I</a> think that the engineer is the fall guy, which is a difference because we've had previous administrations in this community that have allowed private ways to be provided with maintenance and services, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2957.152s">And</a> the only thing that's different is the administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2960.394s">So</a> this is definitely an administrative prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2962.936s">It's</a> something that we're seeing come down from the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2965.437s">It's</a> not coming from the engineer across the city, it's coming from the boss, the mayor, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2970.037s">So</a> when we talk about this resolution and we talk about the issues that Councilor Scarpelli brings up, he says that the city is not maintaining private waste, which would infer that we're maintaining public waste, and we're not doing that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2984.124s">But</a> when we talk about the services that you're entitled to and receive access to as a resident on a private way, we talk about access to the public schools, access to public safety and first response, snow removal and trash removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3001.773s">We</a> don't get trees trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3002.895s">We</a> don't get sidewalks fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3004.097s">We</a> don't get streets paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3005.659s">What</a> about the underground infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3007.843s">Is</a> that the responsibility of the taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3009.546s">Is</a> that the responsibility of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3013.092s">Okay,</a> so where does it stop and where does it start is a big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3017.135s">Now,</a> I don't think people who live on private ways have a problem living on a private way, quite frankly, I don't think people that live on a private way would have a problem paying for some of these services that they want themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3028.282s">I</a> think part of the problem is that they can't get anybody to provide them with help when they want to initiate their rights at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3034.707s">So</a> if I lived on a private way and I said look at I want to put up a crash bar and I want to say resident access only. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3040.612s">Say</a> Wildwood Road, for example, right across the street from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3043.855s">It's</a> a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3045.256s">Why</a> can't they put up, just like they have on Rosina Drive in the Heights, on Murray Hill Road in the Heights, a crash bar where cars can't drive down that street because it's a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3055.944s">And</a> they can tell you when and when you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3057.845s">The</a> fire department can still provide emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3060.487s">The</a> police department can still have emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3062.228s">The</a> MS can still have emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3066.322s">and</a> these residents that live on the streets that are abutting the Mystic Lakes complain year in and year out about the fact that neighborhoods being overrun and inundated by people that are parking on their private ways in front of their houses and their driveways and the like to access the Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3082.313s">But</a> the city doesn't provide them with the information or the tools necessary to protect themselves on their private way, but won't provide them the services either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3089.038s">It</a> becomes very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3090.919s">And</a> inaction is not an answer or a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3094.76s">to</a> a circumstance in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3097.362s">So</a> meetings are great, but ultimately we've had a number of meetings on this back in September and even previously, and we're still talking about it because there's been inaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3107.69s">And</a> that's the difference between what makes a thriving community and what makes a failing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3112.934s">So</a> when we talk about the one thing that people want when they move into a city is they wanna make sure that their tax dollars stretch a long way, they get banked for their buck and they're provided with city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3123.391s">We</a> have over 30% of the streets in this community that are private ways and we're not providing those people with services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3128.416s">Thus</a> far, I feel as though we're failing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3130.818s">We're</a> failing them because we're not providing them with any recourse information or ability to enact or enact their rights or enable themselves to protect their, their investment in their future destiny in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3142.428s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3457.27s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3458.811s">These</a> are some items that have been popular fodder for discussion in our community over recent months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3466.896s">Recently,</a> the school department has met and they've discussed their budget priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3471.259s">Looks</a> like they're about eight or $900,000 short from where they'd like to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3476.712s">I've</a> always had an issue with the school committee and their ability to manage within their budget sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3485.316s">I</a> feel like sometimes you've got to make hard decisions, and that's what elected officials are putting these positions for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3490.878s">And</a> when it comes time to tightening the belt and spending within your means, sometimes our school committee does not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3497.481s">And</a> as a result, we see some wasteful spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3501.022s">It's</a> been brought to my attention that some of these cost items that are <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3505.224s">included</a> in this list, Madam President, are reaching astronomical figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3509.247s">For</a> example, it's my understanding that the cost for teachers covering hallway security duties is somewhere around $25,000 to $35,000 a week of ARPA money being spent for teachers to monitor the hallways up in Method High. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3524.076s">So</a> when we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3526.999s">a</a> school committee's professed shortfall of about $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3529.984s">Let's</a> take a look at some of the spending that we're doing when we talk about the investigation into the NHL softball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3536.015s">I</a> know we have attorney Howard Greenspan <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3538.653s">as</a> the school department's attorney who's on retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3541.274s">Did</a> KP Law conduct the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3543.314s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3544.074s">Why</a> did KP Law conduct the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3545.815s">Was</a> that a special contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3547.075s">Was</a> that something that fell outside the scope of our contract with KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3550.576s">Is</a> that something we're going to be assessed for? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3552.116s">How</a> much did it cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3552.976s">What</a> were the findings of the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3554.917s">Was</a> it a worthy expenditure? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3556.457s">Should</a> we have used internal counsel that we have on retainer or should we have gone outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3560.513s">Is</a> this wasteful spending? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3562.034s">So</a> Madam President, these are some things that I want to take a look at when we talk about the position of data manager and the position of data director. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3569.516s">From</a> what I understand, they have the exact same duties, responsibilities and functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3573.477s">The</a> only difference is the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3576.018s">the</a> incumbent that's in the position is a female who's going to make $10,000 to $15,000 less than the new appointee who's a male. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3582.822s">But</a> their responsibilities and duties really aren't that different. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3585.303s">So</a> I want to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3586.523s">Why</a> is there such a disparity in the wages between these two positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3590.506s">And</a> why is there a need for two positions with duplicate duties? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3595.028s">Also,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3597.753s">Medford</a> High has been on the news a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3599.054s">It's</a> not for winning state championships, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3601.876s">It's</a> because of violence in our school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3604.718s">So</a> the school department went and they hired a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3607.08s">They</a> spent a lot of money on a consultant to file a report, and this report makes suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3611.483s">I</a> want to know what these suggestions are, what the cost of the report was, and whether or not these suggestions are even being implemented, or whether it was just a, let's get us out of the news, hire a consultant to come in here and do a report, and then we can wave the report in the air and say, no, we did something, but not implement any of the changes that they've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3627.737s">So</a> when we talk about previous administration of the school department, and we talk about a gentleman like Mr. Belson, who'd come before us, and who would talk about school violence, well, Roy was one of the founders of the STARS program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3641.402s">The</a> School Threat Assessment and Response System that's been implemented statewide, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3649.165s">That</a> was in response to an issue back in the early 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3656.495s">What</a> steps has this administration taken to put in something like a STARS program that would assess violence on our school systems and establish reasonable response? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3669.224s">So</a> these are some of the things that I have great concern about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3671.446s">We</a> all talk about you can't put a price tag on public safety, but apparently you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3676.13s">I</a> mean, if this is any truth to this expenditure at $33,000 a week in APA funds being assigned for teachers to monitor the halls, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3684.287s">I</a> think that's gross negligence in terms of spending, and it's a gross negligence of the fiduciary responsibility of the stewards of our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3692.21s">So</a> it's pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3693.87s">When</a> we get the answers to the questions, we'll be in a better position to figure out exactly what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3699.892s">This</a> council's been asking now for financial data for three years, and we haven't been receiving it forthwith. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3705.294s">So</a> my hope was to put this on the agenda to give everybody ample notice and time to prepare it, to give it to us before our budget discussions finalize at the end of the month, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3747.349s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3751.671s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3773.389s">We'll</a> survive without him, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3775.77s">We'll</a> survive without him.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3787.698s">Number</a> one, amend table of use and- Madam President, motion to waive the reading and refer to the CD board as pursuant to Massachusetts General Election Act 41A.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3846.869s">On</a> that point, Madam President, I'd just like to ask that the city clerk calendar this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3850.591s">As</a> we know, because this is a zoning change, it's pursuant to certain rules and regulations established by state law that create timelines for us to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3858.296s">And</a> if we don't act in time, then we got to start over from scratch. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3860.538s">And</a> this is a very important matter that I think we need to keep an eye on when we're coming into summer break. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3865.221s">Sometimes</a> these things fall off the shelf. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3866.882s">So</a> I just ask that the city clerk keep us in line to make sure that we do our job.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3928.229s">Madam</a> president.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3929.81s">If</a> we could get a written explanation from the city administration as to why someone would pay us for the use of pride, because I'm not too sure what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3936.752s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3938.053s">That</a> would be great, but it's 500 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3939.733s">I</a> mean, total value of this paper is $850. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3941.374s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3943.134s">I</a> move approval on the paper, but I would like a written explanation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4031.079s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4124.642s">I</a> mean, am I missing something here? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4126.143s">All</a> we're doing is announcing what the early voting dates are, because, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4128.985s">It</a> seems like it's a pretty self-explanatory paper over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4131.686s">All</a> it is is a public service announcement, as far as I can tell, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4266.862s">The</a> paper before us has no language on it, legal or otherwise, saying it doesn't mean the City Council opt in to support early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4273.083s">It</a> doesn't tell us when the dates are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4276.824s">So</a> from a legal standpoint, I mean, usually if there's an opt-in, there's some certain language that you need to adopt or support in order for an opt-in to happen.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4288.206s">That's</a> not the paper that's before us this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4317.517s">So</a> we don't have to take any action. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4321.32s">There's</a> a courtesy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4324.042s">It's</a> not a necessary mechanism of government for us to take a vote for this to happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4328.246s">It's</a> going to happen no matter what.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4585.095s">The</a> paper requires an election from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4587.517s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4587.918s">So</a> my worst fear is Oh, well, I didn't get a chance to vote because early voting wasn't open on Wednesday, the 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4592.661s">Well,</a> the city council approved the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4594.383s">City</a> Council has no authority on this whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4596.885s">So</a> we can recommend that they open on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4599.247s">I</a> don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4600.408s">But</a> in terms of supporting the plan and not supporting the plan, we don't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4603.951s">I</a> don't think we should.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4917.584s">on</a> the <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4938.812s">Now</a> historically, up until Sandy Gale became the elections manager, we never had this issue with the census and with people getting pulled from the list and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4947.039s">It's</a> been a nightmare ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4948.26s">It's</a> created a ton of problems in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4950.521s">We've</a> had people coming up here saying the elections have been raked. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4952.923s">I</a> remember Richard Brady Daugherty up here screaming and yelling saying that the elections raked and Zach Baer's fault because he talked to Sandy and they were colluding to remove people from the rolls and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4964.172s">It's</a> a bad practice, you know, it didn't have that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4966.973s">But</a> that was the that was the general consensus throughout the community was that, you know, Zach was running around trying to control the voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4975.795s">But</a> anyway, what I'm saying is, why don't we cool it on that a little bit, relax a little bit, because it does create a situation where a lot of people get frustrated and it creates voter apathy, where they don't want to come out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4986.698s">and</a> they don't want to go and waste their time going through this ordeal of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4990.699s">I</a> know the elections are great, but they're overwhelmed when they get in there and they got one person that says, what do you mean I can't vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4996.301s">Well,</a> listen, I just talked to 4,000 people that can and you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4998.902s">Like,</a> sorry, what do you want me to tell you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5000.082s">Today's</a> the biggest day of the year for me, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5002.943s">And</a> they don't get the attention that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5004.383s">And</a> then they have to come down to city hall and go back and go back to the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5007.264s">They're</a> not going to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5007.984s">They're</a> just not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5009.665s">So</a> I'll reiterate the fact, I don't think it's the best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5013.646s">I</a> mean, it might be what you're required to do, what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5015.907s">I</a> think it's what you can do, not necessarily what you're required to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5018.908s">But</a> I don't think that it's working in favor of promoting full involvement in elections.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5059.446s">example,</a> like I have to fill out a census, I'm on the ballot, and I gotta fill out a census every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5063.971s">And</a> I can't vote for myself if I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5066.074s">This</a> is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5066.575s">I</a> can't sign my own nomination papers if I don't fill out the census, but I'm an elected official in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5070.66s">To</a> be an elected official, I believe I have to be a registered voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5073.543s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5073.824s">So</a> I'm not a registered voter right now because I didn't fill out the census.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5077.947s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5095.674s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5096.394s">And</a> what I'm saying is that the past practice was never like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5099.375s">And</a> it was always very, it was always a lot easier than what's going on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5104.1s">Now,</a> if this is the way it's going to be, this is the way it's going to be, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5107.283s">I'm</a> just saying that I don't think it's necessarily conducive to promoting full involvement in elections.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5252.356s">How</a> many voters are there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5257.857s">Including</a> the 15,000 hit the road.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5265.265s">It's</a> like a third that you threw out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5267.906s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5268.306s">So</a> like 33% of the registered voters are no longer, are inactive now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5271.367s">They're</a> inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5271.707s">Because</a> they didn't send back a census.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5276.068s">Yeah,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5276.468s">But</a> I mean, ultimately, you took a third of the population from inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5282.35s">Correct,</a> as required. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5285.031s">A</a> third of the voting population, 33%.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5353.053s">I</a> understand your frustration with the- I mean, you can't just throw a third of the people in the community off the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5359.635s">You</a> want to say that they can still vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5360.835s">Listen,</a> you made them inactive voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5362.195s">They're</a> going to show up at the polls and they're going to say, no, you can't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5364.636s">Go</a> stand in the corner and fill it out in the bad boy booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5367.177s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5367.497s">I</a> mean, that's what happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5368.677s">So</a> it's hard enough to get people to want to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5371.178s">And</a> I just think that this is a failed policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5372.598s">It's</a> not your policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5374.159s">It's</a> just a failed policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5375.199s">You're</a> saying it's to comply with the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5376.999s">I</a> think that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5378.22s">It's</a> crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5379.34s">It's</a> crazy if you fall off the, if you don't fill out your census form, but they not send you an excise tax bill, pretty sure they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5384.102s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5385.663s">Pretty</a> sure they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5386.303s">So</a> they're going to take away your right to have a voice, but they're still going to tax you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5460.847s">Madam</a> President, there's a paper that I submitted to be included in the record this evening, pursuant to communications from city offices and employees, which is the section of the agenda that we're into this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5476.876s">I</a> received a correspondence today from the firefighters union. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5480.319s">And</a> at our last meeting, I believe that I do have the right to initiate a point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5486.944s">The</a> mayor told me that I was being distruthful at the meeting the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5490.787s">And</a> this was the same meeting that the mayor said that she was very close to settling all the union contracts and that they were doing a great job and they were this close to settling all the contracts, including the fire contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5503.017s">And</a> this evening, Madam President, in our mailboxes before the meeting, we received a correspondence from the fire union. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5510.485s">And</a> what it says is this administration has been in office for three years and five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5515.731s">Local</a> 1033, I'm sorry, local 1032, which is the Metro Firefighters Union, has been without a contract for 706 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5524.993s">The</a> mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5534.999s">I</a> just want to repeat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5536.96s">The</a> mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5544.944s">That</a> was clear, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5546.485s">That's</a> what the mayor said? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5547.486s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5548.126s">Well,</a> this is what the union says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5549.247s">This</a> could not be any further from the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5554.241s">the</a> city is proposing in their budget double digit percentage raises to their non-union employees while unions in the city go years without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5565.789s">We</a> have new hires to this day who still do not have health insurance through the city of Medford because of administrative errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5574.514s">The</a> mayor's office represented that everybody was covered and that this problem was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5585.437s">There's</a> another thing in this letter that I'd like to point out, Madam President, and that's that in this budget that the mayor has proposed, they're cutting two more firefighter positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5597.106s">At</a> the same time, the mayor is putting out press releases boasting how the city of Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5605.313s">So</a> we have a communication here from employees of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5610.337s">I'd</a> ask that they be included in the record, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5612.879s">It</a> was addressed to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5615.25s">It's</a> highlighting issues and concerns that were brought up at last week's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5619.053s">And</a> it addresses certain things that were said, and I think that it should be included as part of the record and ask my council colleagues to support me and having this letter included as part of the record.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14/2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14.html">City Council 05-23-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=63.707s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=64.968s">And</a> this is a resolution that I've been fortunate enough to put forward each year since my election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=69.392s">Charlie</a> Sheeran was a great mentor to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=71.433s">The</a> first big boy job I had when I was in college was working as an intern in the senator's office and that turned into what seems to be a lifetime in politics now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=80.821s">But</a> I couldn't have done it without the guidance and leadership of Charlie Sheeran. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=84.023s">And</a> Charlie represented the city of Medford with great pride and great diligence, Madam President, he served as our state senator from 1990 to 2005 when he passed as a result of battle with cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=95.647s">Charlie</a> was a US Army veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=98.267s">He</a> was a retired police officer, and he was a career public servant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=104.774s">When</a> we look around the city of Medford, we see some of the things that remind us of the work that Charlie did, and we look around the second Middlesex district we see some of the things that Charlie did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=114.041s">Shannon</a> Beach for example is named after Senator Shannon, in honor of all the work that he's done in restoring Route 16 in the Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=123.188s">So</a> when I think back to my time with Senator Shannon and what was going on in his office during the time that I worked there, I talk about things like marriage equality, we talk about health care for all, we talk about the Green Line extension, these are great things, great issues that really made a difference in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the residents in this community's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=140.803s">So</a> I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to work and learn from Charlie. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=144.026s">Another</a> item that we're going to talk about I'm sure down the line will be <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=148.37s">and</a> the roof of La Conte skating rink was fallen in, it was Senator Shannon who was able to secure the funds to be sure that La Conte skating rink was repaired, refurbished, and maintained so that we can still enjoy it to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=161.36s">So</a> Madam President, it's with a heavy heart that I offer this resolution once again, but it's something that I feel is necessary to be sure that we in this community don't forget somebody that did so much for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=171.127s">So</a> I ask my council colleagues in joining me in supporting this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1410.466s">I'm</a> just glad Madam President, to see that been so successful West Medford Square that they were able to expand and that they're not on the Alta Cuba opening schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=1421.733s">Seems</a> like they've made an announcement to go down there and things are moving relatively quickly so congratulations gentlemen I'm happy to support the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2173.611s">So</a> I'm recommending that there be a delay in the executive order made by the state government supersede any local action.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2252.532s">unless</a> the executive order supersedes the local zoning ordinance, which in my- Well, it may, and that's why I said, that's why I mentioned in part.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2378.854s">Mr.</a> Just for explanation purposes from a historical standpoint, we have an issue like this that came up when Wendy's was looking for an outside dining facility and. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2387.805s">what</a> some of the concerns were was after hours when it's closed and no one's in the facility, people would be using the seats in the chairs to congregate late at night after 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2398.374s">So</a> it was more of a nuisance value thing as opposed to becoming projectiles or what's it called, fodder for larceny.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2931.286s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2934.108s">And</a> it's amazing here we are again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2937.13s">Now</a> it was a baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2937.811s">Well,</a> 16 months ago, we passed this council in January, January 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2941.914s">We</a> passed a resolution asking that the mayor provide us very simple financial data, like Councilor Scott belly said the previous administrations, previous financial directors, but the same exact software were able to give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2955.98s">All</a> we want to know is where you're spending the money on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2959.142s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2960.182s">Then</a> we said, not even weekly, monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2961.843s">Show</a> us where you're spending the money on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2963.764s">Show</a> us what account your money's coming out of and where it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2967.205s">The</a> response we get from the chief of staff is, we don't have someone that has the time to redact that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2973.108s">What</a> needs to be redacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2974.749s">The</a> Transparency Administration, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2976.81s">Remember</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2977.791s">Community,</a> unity, and transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2981.472s">I</a> don't see any unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2983.25s">I</a> don't see any unity among the working people that work in this building, among the rank and file members of our DPW and fire department who have gone without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2993.676s">I</a> don't see any unity with the teachers who took a vote of no confidence in this administration and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=2999.66s">I</a> certainly don't see any transparency when, for 16 months, we've been asking for simple financial data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3005.764s">Follow</a> the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3006.444s">Where's</a> the money going? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3007.365s">And</a> they won't let us look. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3008.525s">They</a> won't let us follow the money, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3010.466s">I</a> think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3011.607s">I</a> think it's absolutely shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3013.957s">It's</a> a smoke and mirrors game. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3016.178s">So</a> when I think back, and we're talking about the budget now, and I think back to that night, the last day of June, last year, and the mayor came up here and she all of a sudden, money was falling out of the sky all of a sudden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3028.041s">What</a> was this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3029.661s">It</a> was $8 million deficit and then they found 4 million in the mayor's top drawer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3034.203s">Then</a> they came in here and the council had some priorities that we needed funded, like an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3040.285s">like</a> an assistant city solicitor for the council and the mayor stood up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3043.428s">And</a> you know what the mayor said, I will hire an assistant city solicitor for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3047.372s">I</a> will post the job in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3049.374s">That</a> was in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3050.535s">We</a> still don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3051.336s">The</a> job hasn't been posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3053.538s">It's</a> posted in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3056.581s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3057.902s">And</a> where did the mayor want to take the money to fund these positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3061.105s">Can</a> anybody remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3062.366s">She</a> wanted to take them out of the negotiated salaries account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3066.893s">The</a> negotiated salaries account, the account where the administration puts money aside to provide cost of living adjustments for those same rank and file workers that she's beating on every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3079.878s">We</a> have a chief of staff that doesn't act like a liaison or a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3083.139s">We</a> have a chief of staff that acts like a defense attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3086.62s">Refuse</a> to answer questions, refuse to provide us with information, refuse to provide us with data. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3092.094s">Now,</a> when someone stands up before me, and we talk and we cut a deal, and they make a promise to me, and they don't fulfill that promise, I call them a liar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3102.576s">That's</a> what I call them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3103.756s">And</a> after all this time that's gone by, with no assistant city solicitor, with no phase two of the zoning review, I think it's safe to say the mayor's a liar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3112.178s">The</a> mayor lied to this body to get what she needed, which was a budget, so that she wouldn't have to talk to us for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3122.058s">Because</a> that's the fact of the matter, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3123.778s">That's</a> the writing on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3124.639s">That's</a> the rationale. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3125.459s">If</a> we were watching this TV show at home, that's what we'd see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3128.22s">The</a> mayor came in here, she promised everybody everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3130.96s">Sprinkles</a> were flying from the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3133.121s">Everything</a> was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3135.521s">Two</a> days later, she's down the Cape. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3138.762s">Nobody</a> hears from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3140.323s">And</a> now here we are, scheduling a meeting for May 19th to talk about the next budget, when we still haven't even gotten the things we were promised from the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3150.232s">Typical</a> of this administration, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3152.794s">Typical</a> of this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3154.935s">I</a> want a mayor that leads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3156.876s">I</a> want a mayor that administrates government. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3159.117s">I</a> don't want a social media influencer for a mayor in my city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3162.96s">And</a> I feel like that's what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3165.021s">It's</a> always lead with a press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3167.162s">Go</a> skating with the kids, go play rock, paper, scissors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3169.964s">But</a> you can't drive down one street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3171.625s">If</a> you live on a private way and you call somebody to trim a tree and get a pothole fixed, good God, it's like you're asking for a miracle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3181.188s">It's</a> like you're asking for a miracle. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3184.61s">We've</a> asked the DPW director about this private way issue and how we can have equity and parity among residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3191.334s">The</a> administration closes their ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3193.175s">They</a> don't want to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3195.176s">When</a> we say we want to take some of these public private ways off the rules and put them as public ways, because that might help us get more chapter 90 funds because the city administration only appropriates $900,000 a year <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3208.812s">for</a> road repairs, and that's money that's appropriated through our cherry sheet in Northridge City Coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3213.114s">The</a> mayor does not match one penny, not one penny in road repairs in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3218.677s">So</a> when we talk about priorities, I mean, the meeting's gonna be 24 hours long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3227.561s">But</a> the number one priority that I have for this council in moving forward in the budget <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3232.443s">going</a> forward is we hold the mayor accountable to her promises, to what she said she was going to give us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3237.864s">Because</a> if she's going to lie to us, then she's going to lie to the people we represent, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3243.585s">And</a> we can no longer be a steward for the taxpayer in this community, because we're getting treated like mushrooms, getting thrown in the closet, in the dock, in the dirt, fed fertilizer in the way of press releases, Instagram posts, and Facebook posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3261.938s">and</a> expected to move forward and make informed decisions on behalf of the people that put us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3266.582s">And</a> then look in the mirror the next morning and say we're doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3270.045s">We're</a> not doing a good job, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3272.407s">We're</a> doing a terrible job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3274.529s">We're</a> doing a terrible job in this community delivering services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3277.291s">I've</a> never seen the city look worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3279.626s">I've</a> never seen the city look worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3281.728s">It</a> was a miracle today when I drove around the Winthrop Street Rotary, the Rotary which by the way, according to the contract on the Eversource project is supposed to be reconstructed, which hasn't been reconstructed and I mind you probably won't be reconstructed because it's too close to an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3297.153s">You</a> got to show some results somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3299.477s">We've</a> been holding all the results in the result bag, waiting for someone to run against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3302.543s">And</a> now we're going to pour them all out and show you all the good stuff we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3305.328s">If</a> we didn't have an opponent, if Consulate Gavreel didn't have the courage to run against his mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3311.108s">Council,</a> budget priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3312.469s">My</a> budget priority is an administrator that administers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3315.692s">A</a> public administrator, not a social media influencer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3319.415s">Someone</a> that keeps their promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3321.177s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3322.118s">Not</a> asking for much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3323.179s">Someone</a> that comes to work, rolls their sleeves up, and does what they say they're gonna do, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3326.842s">Is</a> that too much to ask for? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3329.573s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3431.905s">Madam</a> President, did you say which month was it this month or just a month, month of May, month of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3435.827s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3437.968s">So,</a> Madam President, Councilor going to be a full budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3568.129s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much, and I would defer to Councilor Caraviello on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3571.554s">He</a> was a co-sponsor of this resolution, as he has been in the past, but I erroneously excluded him when I sent it to the City Clerk after speaking with friends from the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3583.129s">Yes,</a> Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3586.61s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, former Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3590.252s">As</a> this resolution says, Madam President, there are hundreds, several hundred motorcycles registered in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3596.394s">Thousands</a> upon thousands of motorcycles pass through our community daily with Route 93 cutting right through the middle of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3603.197s">And</a> quite frankly, the condition of our roadways aren't great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3607.879s">So</a> these are things that do lead to situations of accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3614.46s">This</a> is a resolution that I've been supporting now for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3617.802s">It's</a> fitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3619.242s">I</a> first got involved with the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association when I was working for Senator Shannon, the first resolution we spoke of this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3626.065s">And</a> through his office, I became very friendly with some of the individuals there that were working for a better Massachusetts when it came to rights and when it came to protections for motorcyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3636.75s">And</a> one of the things that came out of this was motorcycle awareness period, Madam President, before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3641.532s">This</a> is a paper that has been supported by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3645.036s">They've</a> established the Massachusetts Motorcycle Awareness Period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3648.76s">And</a> as the weather changes and we see more and more people taking their motorcycles out, it's just important for us to be aware and cognizant of the fact that these <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3658.659s">motor</a> vehicles are going to be on the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3660.0s">We're</a> not used to seeing them so much in the bad weather, but the good weather's here before us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3663.782s">It's</a> a safety issue, Madam President, but it's also a sharing the road issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3667.925s">So</a> many of us are concerned about putting bike lanes in and bus lanes in, but we forget a little bit about those of us that drive motorized vehicles and those on the motorcycle are the most vulnerable when they're on the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3679.112s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I would like to ask my council colleagues to support the resolution and thank you all for indulging me with such a long piece of legislation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3925.288s">I'm</a> going to present for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3927.229s">I</a> think the council for bringing this up and as we talk about Middlesex have something comes to mind, you know, as the weather's changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3932.791s">And</a> as we see the nicer weather get out we see a lot of people like to do what go get their car washed right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3937.772s">And</a> we've had a lot of problems with the car wash down there in Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3941.513s">So,</a> on top of Councilor Tseng's resolution I'd just like to amend it to ask that the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3947.375s">ensure</a> that the police department performs directed patrols down in the area to ensure safe passage of vehicular traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3954.702s">In</a> case that there is an emergency down there, we don't want to impact emergency response times with the traffic coming out of BJ's and the car wash. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3962.59s">It's</a> a nightmare down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3964.251s">And</a> it's a pretty popular place, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3967.094s">So</a> it's one of those things where <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3970.177s">we're</a> a victim of a local business's success. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=3973.238s">So</a> we need to take appropriate steps to make sure that the neighborhood and the residents and the quality of life are protected in that area.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4333.965s">anything</a> getting done in City of Oloroa the way that this administration has been running the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4338.07s">And</a> I thank you for bringing some of these issues up because they're issues that have been going on for a long time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4917.325s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4919.853s">So</a> ultimately what I'm hearing is this ultimately started three years ago with a request to have a tree removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4926.831s">actually</a> a sidewalk.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4930.593s">And</a> then for three years at a time, you were told you're on the list.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4934.935s">And</a> then you finally, actually, you finally came in touch with somebody in city hall and Owen that told you the truth after three years, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4941.758s">Said,</a> we're not going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4942.819s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4943.339s">They</a> put you on the list and they kept telling you they're going to do it for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4947.521s">And</a> they dragged you around for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4948.702s">And</a> you finally found someone that told you the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4950.483s">All</a> right, now, ultimately, an experienced public administrator, Madam President, to something like a sidewalk panel and a tree root to make a resident on the street that pays a lot of money in taxes very happy would be as an experienced public administrator, go to Eversource, <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4969.725s">and</a> leverage your power with levers ever source to do some community mitigation, because that neighborhood has been under construction for the better part of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4977.972s">That's</a> what an experienced public administrator would have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4980.634s">And</a> it wouldn't have had to elevate to this point where you're wasting your time coming up here to the city council because you've been making phone calls for years and years and doing emails for years and years and not getting a good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=4990.843s">an</a> experienced public administrator, Madam President, would have reached out to their partners in government who are doing construction projects in the area and leverage that relationship to provide community and neighborhood mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5002.008s">Something</a> that I've been calling for for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5005.17s">Something</a> that I've spoke to the DPW commissioner about at length on a number of occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5012.013s">So</a> when I hear these stories and these reoccurring themes, <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5016.326s">in</a> these issues that keep coming up and issues that we as a council have provided solutions for the administration, but the administration does not respond to us, does not give us the time of day, does not provide us with the tools, materials and equipment necessary to be successful in representing someone like Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5035.076s">It's</a> shameful, it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5036.577s">And</a> that's the cycle that we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5038.978s">There</a> are revenue issues, but ultimately what I'm hearing is I'm not gonna do it because I don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5044.869s">Right,</a> I'm not gonna do it because I don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5047.0s">Well,</a> for 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5049.563s">someone</a> did it, and no one made a big stink about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5052.844s">The</a> FBI didn't come in here and say, you can't be paving private ways, Mike McGlynn, that's against the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5058.707s">No</a> one seemed to really mind too much when we were providing city services to the residents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5063.189s">But</a> it's when we see such a breakdown and degradation of the level of services that we provide, and when we're scrambling and trying to figure out how we're going to make it work, because we haven't invested the time, materials, energy, and effort, and we don't have the personnel, the qualified personnel, <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5076.895s">We</a> haven't retained anybody with any institutional knowledge, and we haven't been able to track anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5082.837s">You</a> get into a dire situation like this, where the ship is sinking, and now you have to make decisions and determinations like this, where you're pitting neighbor against neighbor and street against street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5092.271s">I'm</a> pretty, I'm pretty sure most people don't know what a private way is and what a public way is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5096.755s">They</a> know it's a green sign that they can turn down and take that street to get off of Winthrop Street to get the woman street if they want to, right, Wildwood Road, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5105.123s">So</a> when I look at this and I hear these issues, I just find it very frustrating because a hands on public administrator, someone that wants to administer and manage would be able to address an issue like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5118.255s">So</a> I'm sorry for your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5121.238s">I</a> like your idea personally that you know the same level of services should be provided to any street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5126.102s">And</a> I, you know, I understand that there are certain rules we can the city can also opt out of the subdivision control bar if we want to, you know, but ultimately right now my hands are a little strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5139.78s">in</a> a couple of different aspects in a couple different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5142.023s">One</a> of them is because we don't have a partner across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5145.046s">Secondly,</a> we don't have the financial ability to turn the street into a public way tomorrow, right so anything that takes place going to take a long period of time to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5155.197s">If</a> in fact it is going to happen and from what I'm understanding the city is not willing to invest that money I think we as a council are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5161.704s">We</a> as a consulate are willing to say, you know, this sidewalk panel should be picked up, this tree should be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5166.349s">Because</a> if the tree falls down, what's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5167.77s">It's</a> going to hit your house, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5168.791s">And</a> you're going to have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5170.633s">If</a> someone slips and falls in front of the house, who do they sue? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5172.595s">Do</a> they sue the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5173.296s">Or</a> do they sue you for the sidewalk panel?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5221.176s">What</a> else you're going to see is a devaluation of your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5226.087s">Because</a> you have the that's the reason for that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5247.763s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5249.104s">So</a> thank you for coming up and thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=5250.865s">I</a> certainly share some of your concerns and something I'm looking forward to working on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7185.703s">So</a> what I'm understanding is that Councilor Beza has spoken with the facility manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7189.785s">The</a> facility manager says he has control over the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7192.146s">We</a> had residents in the community that had spoken with the mayor about the room, and the mayor said that the administration has nothing to do with the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7198.93s">I'm</a> just trying to figure out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7200.611s">This</a> place is like Circus City. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=7202.792s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8223.732s">Madam</a> president, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8225.013s">And,</a> you know, as I'm reading this resolution, I'm thinking to myself that in effect, right now, we already have a moratorium on development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8234.157s">You</a> know, we look around at the cities that are neighboring communities and we see what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8239.139s">And</a> we see them passing Metro by. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8242.054s">We've</a> seen them passing by Everett, Malden, Somerville, Cambridge, Belmont, Waltham, Revere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8248.818s">The</a> list goes on, the list goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8251.219s">Medford</a> is no longer in the driver's seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8253.0s">At</a> one point in time, we were a community at first, and now we're a community that follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8257.402s">So</a> when I sit here and I think about, you know, how we can fix the process and change where we're at, it brings me back to the old saying, if you don't know what you stand for, you can't stand for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8272.42s">And,</a> you know, we have a mayor here that runs on affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8278.065s">A</a> mayor that says that her number one accomplishment was the inclusionary housing ordinance that I wrote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8287.273s">She</a> runs on affordable housing, says that that's her number one success. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8291.457s">Yet,</a> when the reality is, there are three affordable housing developments in this community that she fights and takes it to litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8300.07s">So</a> these are the things that I think Councilor Caraviello is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8303.092s">It's</a> a frustration because it's, don't look at what I'm doing, just look at what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8309.678s">Because</a> we don't have a leader, we don't have a public administrator or a municipal manager in the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8317.384s">We</a> have a social media influencer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8319.845s">That's</a> what we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8321.106s">Let's</a> be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8321.666s">I</a> mean, that's clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8323.107s">That's</a> clear as day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8324.168s">That's</a> fact at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8325.709s">That's</a> fact at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8326.929s">The</a> city's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8327.75s">I'm</a> going to go play rock, paper, scissors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8329.091s">I</a> mean, come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8330.011s">Enough's</a> enough with this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8331.632s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8332.133s">Anytime</a> something bad happens, there's a sign that says Maumau in front of City Hall and people are taking pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8340.658s">So</a> when I talk about the direction that this community is going in, <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8344.877s">and</a> I talk about what I think we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8347.679s">The</a> first thing we need is a municipal manager that knows what they stand for and where they stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8352.723s">And</a> then we need a vision for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8354.485s">And</a> I don't think we have one of those either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8356.707s">So</a> we can talk about all these consultants that come in and all the call-in center and this contract and this consultant that comes in to create a vision for you because you don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8370.297s">Or</a> we can take the reins of this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8373.598s">Because</a> for the last 18, 16 months, two years before that, we've been ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8380.54s">We</a> haven't been given the tools to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8383.041s">And</a> it shows, because the city hasn't looked worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8386.803s">The</a> city hasn't looked worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8388.663s">There's</a> never been a partnership that's been this broken in this community in over four decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8399.547s">And</a> it shows, because the community looks awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8402.991s">So</a> I thank the council for taking the initiative to put a difficult topic to discuss on the agenda, but I thank him for knowing where he stands and what he stands for, because that's what this business is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8414.956s">All</a> you have is your word in this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8416.397s">That's</a> the only thing that follows you around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8417.837s">In</a> politics, the only thing you have is your word. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8420.879s">If</a> you're a person that keeps it, people keep you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8424.496s">If</a> you're a person that doesn't keep it, the people get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8427.279s">The</a> people aren't stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8428.5s">The</a> people know what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8431.162s">And</a> I thank the gentleman for bringing it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8587.605s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8590.646s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8591.287s">I</a> think it's important to point out also that this community needs at least, I'd say one and a quarter to one and a half percent of new growth annually just to sustain, just to sustain just to stay even. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8601.351s">We</a> need one and a quarter to one and a half percent of new growth each year, just to sustain. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8606.155s">So</a> when we talk about a project like the Boston Ab Project, it was going to bring an influx, an influx of money through taxation, through permitting, and more importantly, through the creation of jobs that pay a living wage, jobs that provide benefits for their employees, jobs that provide health insurance for their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8625.113s">Jobs</a> are not a car dealership or a Dunkin' Donuts or a nail salon or a bank, which is, Medford's the capital of, I think, because, I mean, I think, what do we have, 27 Dunkin' Donuts in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8635.637s">There</a> were 20, there were at least 20 Dunkin' Donuts in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8638.318s">That's</a> our business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8640.058s">That's</a> our business model. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8641.399s">But</a> we have a property owner that comes before this council and asks us to support his project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8648.821s">He</a> comes with representatives from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8652.102s">We</a> support the project, we give him the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8654.711s">We</a> carry him on our shoulders out of here like it's a big boom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8658.735s">He</a> goes before the historical commission and they blow a $400 million project up over a garage that sits in the back of button train tracks that's fallen apart and decrepit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8670.026s">And</a> their analysis, their analysis that they used was totally outside the scope of their authority in the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8680.18s">The</a> historical commission is just one of many commissions that we have in this community, but it is out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8687.002s">Out</a> of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8687.862s">Well,</a> it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8689.642s">It</a> comes back to smart growth and smart development. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8691.663s">We</a> can't grow and we can't develop smartly if our boards and commissions don't share a vision with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8699.565s">And</a> if the administration doesn't know where they stand or what they stand for, there's never going to be that shared vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8705.506s">And</a> that's where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8707.306s">That's</a> what happens after three and a half years of no leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8712.07s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8816.888s">Madam</a> President, this was a paper that was before us previously, and the administration had submitted it erroneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8821.049s">There</a> were a number of typographical errors that we asked for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8823.99s">It's</a> come back clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8826.19s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8826.39s">White's</a> been waiting five years for her money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8827.911s">I</a> think it's time we give it to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ioeGy23c7f8&t=8829.551s">So</a> I move approval.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_N9MoS7Sxl18/2024-10-05_N9MoS7Sxl18.html">City Council 04-25-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=133.096s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=134.297s">I</a> just want to join my colleagues in expressing my condolences to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=138.0s">Over</a> the years, Stephen and I have become close friends and he's a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=141.363s">He</a> was raised by two great parents and it shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=145.006s">Stella's</a> values show through and through in our son, Stephen. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=148.168s">It's</a> been a difficult time, as Councilor Scarpelli said, for the family and I just want to join in offering my well wishes to the family throughout this difficult time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=613.619s">If</a> I'm hearing this correctly, I believe the gentleman just said that I'm sorry, I believe the gentleman just said this was, you know, look like it was going to be a purely residential project and then the reason they. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=625.509s">developed</a> with some sort of commercial component was based upon the wishes of the community of the city of Medford during the planning and development process. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=632.571s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=658.223s">Yeah,</a> because I remember when when this went through, and I think that that was part of the deal was that the city was trying to promote this mixed use development and adding commercial components to residential structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=668.491s">So</a> ultimately, this vacant retail space is actually a creation of our own public policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=673.254s">I</a> see no reason why we should stand in the way and I'd move for approval on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=676.396s">I</a> don't think this is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=677.838s">I</a> know this is a public hearing, but this is something I certainly don't have any problem
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1522.267s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1524.809s">Yes,</a> I think it is important to point out you know the term paranormal is a dated term that's included in a zoning act and the question isn't whether or not they're performing functions that are paranormal in nature it's, you know, whether or not this <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1538.97s">function</a> that they're performing where when it's best fit is underneath the zoning act right now that's what it falls under based upon the definitions that have been provided to us beforehand I certainly have no problem with the entrepreneur pursuing an opportunity to create a very successful business here in the city of Medford especially in a downtown district and that there is a market for this type of business I mean we see <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=1563.498s">Salem</a> Massachusetts for example with thrives on this type of business so I mean I wish you the best of luck and you certainly have my support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=2777.676s">Councilor</a> Knight motion to receive in place a file, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3163.788s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3165.009s">This</a> is a project I'm very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3166.73s">This</a> is something that I think dates back to the Burke administration, and it's something that the director, the executive director, Director Driscoll has been keeping us very well apprised of over the years in terms of the progress that's being made in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3181.08s">I</a> just want to commend him for the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3183.622s">This</a> is one of many funding sources that the Housing Authority has been able to utilize to renovate and revitalize the passes over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3190.468s">And</a> this project is going to be good for our community, good for our seniors, and it's going to be good in addressing some of the affordable housing shortages that we have here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3198.315s">And</a> for those reasons, I'll be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3201.317s">When</a> we look back at the application that's before us, what comes to mind for me is the <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3211.063s">multiple,</a> five, six public meetings that we've had on this previously already to discuss what's going on, prepare us for what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3219.653s">That's</a> the way that financial management should take place in a municipality, especially one of this size. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3224.959s">So,</a> again, I commend Executive Director Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3227.882s">for</a> all those work in keeping us informed and for seeing this project through from its beginning stages to its end. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3234.603s">It's</a> all too often that we see press releases that say what we're gonna do, but then we never see what we say we're gonna do get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3241.505s">And</a> I've always known Jeff to be someone that leads by results and not by press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3246.666s">And</a> this right here is proof of the pudding, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=3248.586s">So</a> I certainly thank the Community Preservation Committee for their favorable recommendation and I move for approval on the application statement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5681.641s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5681.721s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5682.161s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5683.342s">Council</a> night as the dissenting vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5685.544s">I</a> feel so. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5686.064s">It's</a> my obligation to explain where I come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5689.087s">Why</a> when voting against these amendments to, uh, these. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5694.751s">Resolutions</a> to move to amend that city job. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5698.394s">Um</a> from day one in my election to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5701.236s">I've</a> always felt that the best path to try to change was through the time tested <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5710.976s">I</a> don't support an abbreviated review. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5713.297s">And</a> I truly questioned whether or not people in power trying to expand their own power was the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5720.199s">And</a> looking at the papers before us this evening, or the series of papers that are before us this evening, we still have the elephant in the room to deal with the fact that we have zero legal counsel at all to provide us with any support. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5730.643s">The</a> constitution of this community is the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5734.905s">And</a> for us to move forward in haste without legal counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5738.712s">providing</a> advice, consent and direction, I think is something that we need to review with great caution and handle with kids gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5747.0s">So</a> for those reasons and those reasons alone, I will be voting against this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5751.945s">Since</a> my election to the city council, there's always been some small <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5757.53s">movement</a> in this community to review or amend the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5762.092s">And</a> there's been small minority groups that have moved to try to collect the signatures to do such, and they have been able to do so, which tells me that there is a lack of interest in addressing the charter in this community by the general populace. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5777.697s">And</a> for that reason as well, I will be voting against this paper soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5781.818s">I</a> thank the Councilor for the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5783.299s">I</a> appreciate his initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5786.24s">You</a> know, you got to start somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5788.941s">And</a> again, you know, it's almost what came first, the chicken or the egg. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5793.502s">You</a> know what I'm saying? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5794.062s">We</a> don't have the tools to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5796.143s">and</a> he's put in the paper for this, trying to give us the tools, but it's really a philosophical and theoretical discussion as to how it feels the government should work and what's best practice for good government. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=5807.068s">So</a> it's for that reason that I'll be voting against it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6432.86s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6433.841s">I'm</a> just thinking for, you know, this is a great school right I mean it's one of the most prestigious universities around you think these kids might not had across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6441.666s">You</a> know, but with that being said, maybe we can we can ask our friends up at Tufts University to. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6449.07s">have</a> a class called look both ways before crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6452.073s">But</a> I do commend the gentleman for putting the paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6455.595s">But,</a> you know, there has to also be some personal responsibility, I think, when it comes to pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6460.159s">And,</a> you know, I think this is one of the perfect examples thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6463.942s">So</a> with that being said, I'll support the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6465.863s">But</a> I don't think this is certainly a priority of the Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6662.723s">Madam</a> President, on that, I just ask that any work that we do related to Riverside Avenue be coordinated with the MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6670.29s">If</a> we think back, we had an opportunity to resurface Riverside Avenue for a significant stretch, I believe, from Freedom Way going up towards <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6680.954s">a</a> narrow bread for lack of a better explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6683.517s">And</a> the council was looking for some additional concessions curb stones and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6689.643s">But</a> ultimately, the MWRA and National Grid had a project that would have provided curb to curb resurfacing to that stretch of certain stretch of Riverside Avenue that was in significant need of disrepair for payout. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6701.392s">the</a> city council request that the administration move forward and resurface that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6706.195s">That'll</a> put us in a position where we'd have the five year moratorium placed on the road, and it wouldn't be able to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6711.138s">So</a> we put ourselves in a situation where we had public utilities that were willing to resurface the roadway for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6717.562s">And</a> now we're doing it, we're paying for it, and we're locking it up for five years and preventing them from doing their underground infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6723.806s">So</a> with that being said, I just ask that the city engineer be provided with this information as well as Mr. Lasky over at the MWRA.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=6732.033s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7144.507s">Ultimately,</a> Madam President, what it was, was a paper that was going to create a CAF 19 for the human resource directors position as well as other positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7152.173s">But</a> that position was included in the paper and that is a same or similar paper that has been rejected by this body and therefore is barred from introduction.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7171.945s">It</a> was taken off the table to be disposed of that it was disposed of and then it was reintroduced less than 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7179.351s">So</a> the council voted on it saying goodbye. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7182.053s">And</a> then the mayor brought it back, but the mayor brought it back before the cooling off period. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7197.467s">I</a> mean, we have rules, but we don't need them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7199.208s">And</a> we could just throw them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7201.989s">Ultimately,</a> the rules are put in place is check and balance, you know, be sure that we stay honest and transparent.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7259.47s">Clarification</a> Madam President, so ultimately the paper was introduced this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7263.333s">I</a> made a motion to have the paper ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7265.094s">The</a> paper was ruled out of order and now we're still talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7267.476s">The</a> paper's been ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7268.737s">It's</a> time to move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7326.325s">Well,</a> my question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7327.867s">If</a> the paper's already been ruled on and it's been ruled out of order, what are we recessing on? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7331.991s">Have</a> you made a ruling? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7333.452s">She</a> did.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7334.273s">The</a> paper was out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7335.253s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7335.594s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7336.695s">That</a> is all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7396.037s">Point</a> of Parliament, we agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7397.337s">Madam</a> President, the paper has already been addressed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7405.549s">So</a> the motion is... My motion is to... The question of the chair is whether or not the paper's out of order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7414.414s">So</a> the paper will need a supermajority in order to move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7428.816s">Okay,</a> just put it down a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7430.636s">She</a> just ruled it out of order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7454.937s">What</a> was it the clerk puts out a report to do?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=7475.656s">We</a> don't want them to forget Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8689.896s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8690.777s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8692.759s">Ultimately,</a> you know, we have two papers that are before us this evening, one paper for a loan of a sidewalks, and another paper for <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8701.597s">raises</a> for non-union employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8703.658s">And</a> when I look at these papers, I say to myself, does our city need sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8707.239s">Ultimately,</a> that's the first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8708.34s">Does</a> our city need sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8709.36s">Absolutely,</a> our city needs sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8714.563s">Ultimately,</a> this paper that's before us, I think, asks us to borrow more money than the city's been appropriating to repair streets in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8725.227s">They're</a> asking us to borrow money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8728.829s">And,</a> you know, I'm sitting there and I'm just thinking back months, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8733.291s">Months,</a> we've been asking them where they're spending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8737.994s">Why</a> can't we be provided with the Warren articles? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8741.716s">We've</a> been asking for it since our prior finance director was run out of town under discrimination suits. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8747.819s">All</a> right, she was able to give it to us, no problem, with a push of a button. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8751.581s">So</a> I really don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8754.243s">You</a> know, so when we talk about borrowing money, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8759.36s">And</a> we talk about an administration that prides itself on transparency, but this is the same administration that refuses to provide us with the documentation that shows where they're spending their money, as requested by the council on a number of occasions now, probably totaling in the double digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8778.925s">It</a> raises a red flag, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8780.966s">It</a> raises a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8782.626s">So</a> when we talk about the loan, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8785.922s">I</a> talk about financial transparency and I talk about the request that this council has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8791.887s">The</a> request that this council has made for months and months and months upon end. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8796.711s">And</a> the answer that I get when I say, where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8799.133s">Where</a> are the Warren articles? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8800.954s">Oh,</a> we don't have the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8802.596s">We're</a> too busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8804.798s">Well,</a> there are two non-union personnel in this room whose salary total about a quarter of a million bucks that are here before us for a raise, but they're too busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8814.328s">to</a> provide us with the documentation that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8816.93s">They're</a> too busy to give us the papers that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8821.273s">I</a> mean, that's the excuse that we've been given, time in and time out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8826.316s">So</a> they're not able to provide us with the simple financial data that their predecessors were able to provide us with, or willing to provide us with, maybe is more accurate of a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8838.464s">But</a> yet, they're here asking for a race. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8844.636s">So</a> when I hear the term non-union, I think depominate. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8849.76s">That's</a> what I think when I hear the term non-union, depominate, because that's really what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8853.683s">This</a> is a race for depominates. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8855.804s">And</a> when we look at this paper, and we examine this paper in its initial state, when it came before us, when the mayor tried to give herself a raise in this paper retroactively, without disclosure to the council, without a list of titles to the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8874.775s">explaining</a> what titles were going to be elevated. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8879.016s">And</a> this is the cost of living adjustment for non-union personnel, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8882.077s">This</a> has nothing to do with the number of CAFRI classifications that the administration's put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8888.639s">Meanwhile,</a> the administration's talked <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8891.258s">so</a> braggadociosly about the opportunity to have a compensation study that's been forecasted from some grant that we were awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8900.386s">I</a> don't see the compensation study, but week in and week out, I see titles that are coming before us for increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8907.832s">Meanwhile,</a> the rank and file workers, DPW, our police, our fire, our clerical workers, the people that we pick up the phone every day and call and say, can you fix this pothole farming? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8920.713s">Can</a> you do a wellness check on this family? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8922.454s">I</a> haven't seen my neighbor in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8924.956s">My</a> father fell down, can you come help me pick him up? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8928.019s">My</a> basement's flooded, can you come over and help pump me out? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8931.502s">Those</a> are the people that aren't getting the raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8934.904s">And</a> the people that are getting the raise are the ones that aren't gonna provide us with the information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8941.469s">I</a> think this is backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8943.251s">I</a> think a rising tide floats all boats, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8946.453s">But</a> never ever will I put the management before the working people ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8952.456s">And</a> that's what the administration is asking us what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8955.758s">And,</a> you know, I certainly believe that non-union personnel in this community deserve a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8962.441s">And</a> if you look at my track record, and you go back to previous administrations, you'll see who held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8970.467s">a</a> raise for non-union personnel when it wasn't equal to what union personnel were getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8976.769s">When</a> the prior administration asked non-union personnel to take a zero, I held it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8982.151s">I</a> wouldn't approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8983.272s">And</a> I negotiated with the administration to defer that zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8986.673s">So</a> they took a zero one year and they deferred it and got a raise in the end that made up for it, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8990.894s">And</a> everybody was whole and everybody was happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8993.107s">There</a> are ways to do this, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8994.949s">There</a> are ways to work with labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=8996.51s">There</a> are ways to work with the personnel in this building to make them happy, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9000.173s">There</a> are ways to work in partnership and in concert with this council and with the people that are in this building, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9008.58s">I'd</a> love to have a hands-on mayor versus a social media influencer. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9011.883s">I</a> really would. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9013.124s">But</a> at this point in this game, Madam President, where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9016.787s">We're</a> no further ahead today than we were in January or the January before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9022.268s">And</a> for us to take these votes right now is going to send a message to those rank and file workers that have been fighting and struggling every day with the administration whose rights have been trampled to say, yeah, yeah, we hear you, but we really don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9033.78s">We're</a> still going to reward them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9035.082s">And</a> we're still going to give them their raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9036.383s">And</a> you'll get yours too, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9037.725s">If</a> there's money left and she decides to appropriate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9043.238s">So</a> I can't, in good faith, Madam President, take these votes this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9048.36s">I</a> want to support this paper to give the non-union personnel a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9051.641s">I</a> want to support it when the time is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9053.262s">The</a> time right now is not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9055.363s">I</a> want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9056.743s">I</a> want to support these sidewalks, because these are needs that our community have. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9060.345s">These</a> are needs that our community has. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9062.585s">I</a> want to support these papers, but I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9065.086s">I</a> can't, in good faith, look at myself in the mirror tomorrow if I take these votes and vote yes, because I'd find it to be fiscally irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9073.249s">Fiscally</a> irresponsible, because I've given this same goddamn speech week in and week out, asking about fiscal transparency, asking about where the money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9081.635s">And</a> I get this, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9083.876s">That's</a> what I get. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9084.576s">I</a> get nothing but lip service and mumbo jumbo, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9088.339s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9093.262s">I'm</a> comfortable waking up in the morning, knowing that I took the good vote, knowing that I stood by my principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9101.214s">No</a> one that I'm not going to be walked over and pushed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9105.536s">Not</a> taken advantage of, taken for granted, and not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9109.018s">Because</a> that's what this is about at this point, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9112.059s">The</a> rank and file workers not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9114.22s">The</a> council's not being respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9117.521s">But</a> we're being asked to do an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9121.983s">I</a> don't think it's right, and I don't think it's fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9124.845s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9592.468s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9593.689s">A</a> couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9594.349s">First</a> of all, the rank and file need it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9597.031s">The</a> rank and file workers need it more because they make less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9601.949s">Right,</a> the rank and file make less more. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9604.512s">So,</a> these races have a bigger impact on their life than they were in the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9609.197s">Number</a> two, we don't see our rank and file union workers getting reclassification requests presented to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9620.89s">We</a> don't have the FOB reclassification plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9623.773s">The</a> Friends of Brianna reclassification plan, depending on who you are and what role you're in, you might get a raise, you might not, you might get a reclassification, you might reclassify your title. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9633.545s">Number</a> three, Madam President, these non-union personnel do have a role in the breakdown <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9641.771s">in</a> labor relations between the rank-and-file workers and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9645.435s">You</a> can't say that the chief of staff, that the city attorney, that the HR director haven't had a direct impact on the breakdown in the relationship and the morale with our rank-and-file workers in the fire department, in the DPW, in the clerical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9657.87s">You</a> can't say it, because we've seen them here expressing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9664.603s">What</a> was requested from the administration some 30 plus months ago was not a dearth of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9671.867s">It</a> was rather concise. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9674.409s">A</a> copy of the Warren articles once a month that shows us where you're spending the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9678.211s">That's</a> all we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9681.212s">Now,</a> usually when there's conflict, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9688.663s">You</a> don't have to act when there's conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9690.904s">You</a> can take a step back and wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9692.705s">So</a> if your values are being conflicted, wouldn't now be the time to take a step back and not hurt anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9699.267s">Sit</a> back and wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9699.987s">Because</a> that's what I'm comfortable doing this evening, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9705.99s">I</a> don't want to vote him down. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9707.33s">I</a> just want him to sit right where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9708.991s">And</a> let's see if some of these issues that we're talking about work themselves out. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9712.592s">Because</a> I'm not comfortable supporting these <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9717.29s">requests</a> that are before us this evening, based upon the current events that are going on in this community, the circumstances that arise every time we request financial transparency, the circumstances that arise every time we request basic information. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9737.709s">If</a> we keep being the rubber stamp, we're going to get treated <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9741.873s">just</a> like that, a rubber stamp, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9744.374s">I</a> rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9745.054s">We've</a> debated this thing till we're all blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9748.036s">You</a> know, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9749.016s">It's</a> a dead horse at this point in time, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9751.317s">But,</a> you know, when I sat there and I looked at those workers that were standing here, the 200 workers that were standing here, and I told them I stood with them, I meant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9758.42s">And</a> I'm gonna stand with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9759.52s">And</a> that's where I'll stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9760.361s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9830.357s">Point</a> of personal privilege on that, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9834.779s">Ultimately,</a> the people that I'm trying to support in this community are the taxpayers, the people that put us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9842.784s">That's</a> who I'm trying to support because I see this lack of fiscal transparency as a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9847.555s">We</a> haven't had this with any other administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/N9MoS7Sxl18&t=9850.298s">We've</a> never had an administration run on a platform of transparency, and then shut all the lights off in City Hall.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_HNVdkvZxhH8/2024-10-05_HNVdkvZxhH8.html">City Council 04-11-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=400.743s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=401.804s">Madam</a> Superintendent, how does this application differ from years past and what changes were made based upon the feedback that you mentioned that you received? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=409.047s">Obviously,</a> we haven't been able to secure this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=411.193s">funding</a> now for multiple years, we're getting feedback from the point the enabling authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=418.258s">So</a> what changes are we making to the application to maybe enhance our chances.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=563.312s">So</a> on that, Madam President, so the one difference, the difference is nothing other than the fact that we moved some items that were covered under the accelerated repair grant from last year over to the school grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=572.655s">That's</a> what I'm understanding.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=575.676s">It's</a> the same exact application as last year with the addition of these infrastructure items that were under the accelerated repair grant being moved over to this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=583.102s">Is</a> that accurate?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=589.943s">The</a> question they asked was, you know, how does this application differ from years past?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=594.544s">So</a> that one item, right, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=596.265s">All</a> right, yeah, I was looking, because I had my files, I was looking, I usually have my files nice and organized, but I can't find the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=602.986s">Someone</a> must have moved them, so that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=604.526s">But</a> I was looking to see if I could look at last year's application and see if we could take a look at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=608.807s">But</a> I didn't have it in my files yet, because my filing system's a little screwy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=612.948s">But</a> I'm looking at this so ultimately, this is the same application that we submitted last year with a couple of additions that application is the same application we submitted the year before.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=682.225s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=682.705s">I'm</a> just seeing, you know, a lot of money being spent that's not being spent in the classroom, and I'd like to take a look at that as we get prepared for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=691.667s">Madam</a> President, ultimately, you know, it's pretty cut and dry, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=693.988s">It's</a> an application we submit every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=695.309s">All</a> we're doing is asking for free money, so I don't see any reason why we shouldn't support it and move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1057.737s">Yes,</a> and looking through our responses that we received, I just like to point out, Council response to paper 23048 from my state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1067.788s">This</a> was a request made by the city council to ask that the dot and DCR provide some routine roadwork and. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1077.533s">Representative</a> Donato has gotten back to us, saying that both the DOT and the DCR have indicated that their repairs have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1084.097s">However,</a> if we go right to this on-ramp right here, right beside City Hall, the repairs aren't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1089.819s">So</a> maybe we could just ask that the administration follow up on that request, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1098.624s">Motion</a> to revert back to regular order business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1223.506s">Madam</a> President, this is an issue that I've discussed in the past as well and I think it's really an issue of parking capacity, you know, we issue a permit to a repair shop, but we really don't put any restrictions or confines on parking capacity based upon the size of the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1238.357s">So</a> if you drive down Mystic Gap, the first <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1240.939s">two</a> shops you'll see in probably what Volsar and Atech. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1243.861s">If</a> you look at the parking lot at Atech, I mean, you can't fit a piece of paper between the cars in the parking lot there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1248.844s">There</a> must be 35 cars in this very small parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1252.047s">Now,</a> you know, we approved the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1253.768s">I</a> have no problem with these people trying to make a buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1255.829s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1256.43s">It's</a> the American way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1258.011s">But,</a> you know, at the end of the day, it's also creating issues where <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1262.106s">These</a> lots appear overcrowded and unsightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1264.827s">Mystic</a> Avenue, for example, is a gateway road to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1267.988s">So</a> we're going to drive from Somerville into Medford, and that gateway road is going to look like an industrial park, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1274.29s">The</a> condition of the roadway is bad enough as it is, but now to have, you know, unsightly businesses that really aren't a welcoming business to the community, I think is something we need to talk about as we go into our meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1285.113s">Also,</a> it raises, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1287.468s">issues</a> about safety, whether or not these lots are questionably safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1292.729s">If</a> you have a parking lot with 25 cars in there, how can you get a fire engine in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1298.131s">These</a> repair shops, they have flammables, they have combustibles, and it puts us in a position where we may be putting our <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1307.11s">first</a> responders and our fire personnel at risk in responding to these, to cause these locations because of the overcrowding of the parking lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1314.472s">So</a> these are definitely things that we need to take into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1316.313s">And</a> I might just ask that this be set to fire prevention as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1320.054s">So</a> that fire prevention can be provided the opportunity to pipe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1323.796s">It's</a> all too often when we talk about permitting a new business, we talk about the parking and the impacts that it's gonna have on the community, but we don't really think about the impact that it's gonna have on fire safety and fire prevention as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1334.059s">So</a> I just ask that this paper be sent to the fire chief.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1524.941s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much and I think the council for bringing this initiative up by issue up raises a couple of interesting points. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1533.427s">So,</a> here in the city of Medford we have what's called the university accountability ordinance right as Councilor caveat noted down that provides us with a list of all the parcels were touched university students live in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1545.894s">And</a> we also have another ordinance called the clean it or lean it ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1550.041s">So</a> I'm wondering how these two ordinances would combine and intertwine, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1554.003s">If</a> we actually sent our code enforcement officer out to remove the mattresses, could we then put a clean it and lean it on either the parcel or Tufts University where it's an extension of the campus? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1567.431s">I</a> mean, I think that it might make sense for us to try to see if that would be something we could tie to the university where we could use the clean it or lean it ordinance to see if we could get some relief in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1577.856s">Tufts</a> is pretty good at policing its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1579.582s">There's</a> no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1580.763s">And</a> if it comes down to us using the clean and lean and ordinance to promote and produce corrective action to bad behavior, I think Tufts would be on board because one thing they don't like doing is spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1595.152s">So</a> with that being said, I think this is something that we can look at a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1600.676s">I'd</a> like to get an opinion from the non-existent city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1604.274s">as</a> to how these ordinances were intertwined and whether or not if we were going to utilize the clean, no-lead ordinance, would it be applied to the, could be applied to the university as opposed to the possible property owner? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1616.159s">I'll</a> put that in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1627.243s">Just</a> because the administration isn't doing their part doesn't mean that we can stop, we have to stop doing ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1631.244s">So</a> I'm going to continue to ask the questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1637.385s">Whatever</a> the board's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1639.386s">Either</a> way, it's one of the dozen of the others.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1661.256s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1675.642s">Whatever.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1676.202s">I</a> mean, at this point, it doesn't matter what we say. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1677.802s">We're</a> going to get what we're going to get, which is nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1679.683s">So,</a> you know, I'll ask the question and let the administration, when they feel like we're going to have to do something with it, and whoever they send it to is fine with me because it's not going to move anyway, I'm pretty sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1687.724s">Based</a> upon my experience over the past 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1690.584s">You're</a> asking for a legal opinion?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1718.978s">So</a> the code enforcement officer can do that, but make a notification.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1726.261s">Actually,</a> Madam President, what I would do is I would draw and just ask for the code enforcement officer to report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1730.542s">And</a> then when we get that report back, we can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1732.563s">And</a> maybe by then I can have some answers as to what's going to apply in one month. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=1735.384s">That'll</a> satisfy everybody.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2376.841s">Madam</a> President, motion to send this back to the legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2381.542s">We</a> have here a date of accident, February 3rd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2383.342s">Then</a> when we read the description of the alleged claim, it says that the accident happened on or around March 8th, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2388.964s">That's</a> a big discrepancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2392.386s">like</a> to make sure if we're going to be spending money and this is a legal document, legal document that's going to be bound by law once the council approves it, that we're approving something that's accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2402.151s">And</a> it doesn't appear to me that this is an accurate description of what happened when we have two different dates of accidents on the same document, which is, again, just another reflection as to why we should probably have an in-house city solicitor, instead of a hired gun that we're using to do all of our legal services for the mayor's office, as opposed to the city of Medford and its people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2418.359s">So</a> with that being said, I'd offer a motion to send this back to the legal department for
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2618.801s">Can</a> we just amend that to include judgments as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/HNVdkvZxhH8&t=2620.782s">Settlements</a> and judgments.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_1MmmUyIRaFo/2024-10-05_1MmmUyIRaFo.html">City Council 03-28-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=198.163s">Madam</a> President, if we could just ask that the city clerk reach out to our friends at the American Legion to see what impact this will have on our election day operations as well, whether or not if those pocket spots are gone, the American Legion will still be able to continue to serve as a polling location during those days because they have operational needs to meet as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=216.852s">So</a> if they don't have those pocket spots, they might have to pull out of their agreement with the city to be used as a polling place. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=222.155s">So</a> that's something that I think we need to look into because we have an election coming up very shortly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=644.096s">Madam</a> President, on this issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=645.974s">If</a> we look at the agenda, I believe we do have some representatives from Eversource that are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=649.476s">And</a> the construction schedule is going to be something we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=652.077s">And</a> as I'm looking at the handout that they gave us, it looks like they're going to be doing about 3,000 linear feet of milling and paving from Winthrop Street to Mystic Valley Parkway in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=662.402s">So</a> maybe we could hold the discussion on this topic until that comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=666.444s">Because</a> it's brought under public participation, we can't make any motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=669.085s">But</a> if we bring it up underneath the Eversource paper, we'll be able to make some motions and have some action on it now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1329.134s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much, and Mr. so thank you for a presentation once again this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1334.479s">So</a> you talked about some of the surrounding towns and I just want to get a good visual Can you explain, can you name some of the surrounding towns like Everett Malden.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1459.506s">Medford.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1459.966s">And</a> I think Mr. Salt is important to point out the demographic differences of all these communities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1464.727s">So</a> we have, we have more than ever, Chelsea, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1466.948s">Then</a> we have Newton, we have North Reading, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1468.868s">Then</a> we have Waltham, which is one of our number one comps. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1471.408s">When</a> we talk about what my community is doing, Waltham and Braintree are two that we always talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1476.309s">Waltham</a> and Braintree do we always compare ourselves to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1478.77s">So</a> when we look at what's going on, we're seeing that every other community can do it no matter what their demographic, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1483.291s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1483.731s">No</a> matter what their makeup or where failing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1485.771s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1486.271s">Can</a> you tell me what the cost of a mediation would be?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1554.147s">So</a> we have five agreements in the city that are going to be going to mediation legal fees that are going to be paid privately because we don't have a city solicitor 50 labor charges five wage lawsuits and then
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1567.199s">And</a> then a number of freedom of information requests that have gone unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1570.14s">So</a> we're at the Secretary of State's fighting for that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1574.182s">And</a> a lot of the stuff that you request, I believe is necessary for you to have the proper information and tools to represent your membership effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1581.284s">So</a> the way I'm looking at this, Madam President, what I'm seeing here is that this has become a situation where it's a refusal to provide information because they don't want you to be a strong advocate for your membership.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1642.16s">really</a> in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1643.723s">Well,</a> Madam President, I thank Mr. South once again for coming up here and the advocacy that he's doing for his membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1650.414s">It's</a> not often, you know, I've been on the council for a number of years now, and it's not often to see this many people in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1656.659s">week</a> in and week out, week in and week out, right, the issue needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1662.044s">I</a> as one Councilor proposed it in the past and I still believe that this council should not approve any new positions in any reclassifications of existing positions until such time as the existing employees that we have in City Hall taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1674.608s">That</a> means that these contracts should be settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1676.049s">We</a> shouldn't be given any new, creating new positions or reclassifying existing positions until these people right here are taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1683.896s">The</a> five groups that are going to be going to mediation reach some sort of satisfactory conclusion that we can all live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1689.981s">Because</a> ultimately it's bringing the morale down in the city to the point where I wonder how these people get up every day and go to work because they're not feeling respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1696.466s">They're</a> not feeling valued. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1698.428s">And</a> that's not the values that we share. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1701.685s">So</a> I agree with the speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1703.986s">I</a> mean, if it weren't for him coming up here every week and keeping the full court press on, I think this would be an easy walk for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1710.49s">Steve's</a> doing his job and he's really making us aware of a lot of things that are going on behind closed doors, things that we don't get to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1717.454s">I</a> know that this is the transparency administration, but it's not very transparent sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1722.457s">And</a> I thank him for taking the time, energy and effort to come up here week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1726.64s">I</a> mean, the gentleman represents many, many, many, many units, not just Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1730.518s">But</a> every time there's a meeting, he's here, he gives this time to come here and do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1735.183s">And</a> he's not wrong on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1737.606s">He's</a> not wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1738.947s">So</a> again, you know, I'm of the firm belief that no new positions, no reclassifications until these contracts get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1745.594s">We</a> need to take care of our existing employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1747.096s">We</a> need to show them that they're valued and respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1748.918s">If</a> the administration isn't going to do it, then we need to do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1778.138s">I</a> think the administration and KP law have been very clear that they don't represent the whole entire city they represent the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1783.96s">Well</a> they seem to be working for every department but they're only representing the mayor's, the mayor's interests, because they're the mayor's private lawyer, that's who their client is what so no one's representing the taxpayer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1913.147s">On</a> that point though Madam President, the council passed an ordinance, probably 60 years ago, and the ordinance says there shall be a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1922.221s">And</a> the legislative intent is that for my research, behind that ordinance was to control legal costs so that we don't end up in a situation like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1929.883s">So</a> ultimately we have an administration that's working outside the scope of the existing ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=1934.564s">And</a> she did take an oath to say that she would, to the best of her ability, uphold the ordinances of this community when she got elected to office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3374.452s">I'll</a> just stop you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=3375.553s">Can</a> we just talk about Boston Ave and High Street real quick?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4214.717s">Madam</a> President, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4217.177s">Does</a> it really make sense for us to even debate every single position? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4220.218s">If</a> we look at the report that the presenters have prepared for us, they tell us what the average weekday ridership is for each one of these stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4229.482s">And</a> I mean, if there's less than 25 people a day, I have no problem eliminating those stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4236.586s">I</a> think that, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4237.487s">If</a> we really want to get this done, we're going to sit here and we're going to go over every single one of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4241.249s">And</a> we're going to talk about the one elderly person that lives up on Winford Way that takes the bus obviously on an average 0.1 times a month, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4248.933s">Why</a> don't we just look at it from a ridership standpoint and say, if the stops aren't being used effectively or efficiently, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4254.956s">Then</a> just get rid of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4256.357s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4256.537s">And</a> then when I think that, yeah, there's two conversations, there's the elimination and then there's the right, right, I think you get the eliminations for the easy, easy discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4265.601s">I</a> just think, I mean, that would be my suggestion right now be anything with less than 25 per day, just get rid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4271.024s">Well,</a> I certainly have no problem eliminating those. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4273.705s">Okay,</a> anything less than 25.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4280.985s">I</a> mean, we don't have to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4281.985s">All</a> they're doing is giving us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4283.285s">They'd</a> like us to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4284.406s">We</a> don't have to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4285.326s">I</a> mean, what I'd like to see.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4290.547s">So,</a> I mean, what I'd like to see is that we do like a robocall like the mayor does for everything in the city when she has an opponent and says anybody that's in a bottle within what's the distance that she wants, 800 feet or something like that, that she proposed when she was on the council, anybody that's in that distance, we'll get a robocall and we'll discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4306.43s">I'll</a> get invited to a meeting and discuss that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4308.75s">let</a> the people in the neighborhood decide how it's going to affect them and the actual riders that are down there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4321.644s">I</a> mean, I don't think anybody behind the rails opposed to the MBTA doing accessibility <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4327.752s">improvements.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4328.333s">The</a> gentleman explained it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4329.634s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4330.175s">I</a> think he said that the PADI program is for the MBTA to provide accessible ridership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4335.52s">The</a> bus network redesign project is a totally different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4338.603s">That's</a> an operations thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4340.165s">So</a> the redesigns operations, this is to improve the network's safety infrastructure for accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4347.393s">So,</a> you know, I don't think we should get too crazy about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4349.836s">They're</a> willing to invest a lot of money in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4351.939s">They</a> have engineers, they have the tools and the requirements to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4355.543s">So</a> when it comes to that stuff, you know, I really don't have an issue with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4358.888s">I</a> think that, you know, the T has to comply, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4361.912s">It's</a> the subject of a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4363.053s">So</a> if we say no, what are you going to do?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4527.035s">Could</a> we do bump outs? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4528.756s">I'm</a> gonna say, can we not do bump outs? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4530.197s">That's</a> my position on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4531.398s">Like</a> every person that lives in that neighborhood's complaining about those lollipop sticks they put up there and the amount of traffic that it creates down there during rush hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4539.804s">It's</a> like... It's impassable in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4545.395s">impassable</a> the way that it's designed right now with those lollipop sticks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4724.336s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4726.336s">So</a> how far is your obligation of accessibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4731.445s">on</a> city roadway when it comes to this project, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4733.306s">So</a> the bus pulls up, the bus stop, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4734.666s">You're</a> gonna go, it looks like everything's about eight feet in each direction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4738.448s">Is</a> that about as far as you guys go? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4739.688s">Because</a> what I'd hate to see, right, is like you guys do the beautiful corner, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4744.81s">And</a> then it comes and it stops and it turns into a gravel pit all the way down the street, which is gonna be the city's problem or the city's responsibility, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4752.933s">Because</a> we've seen it in other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4754.514s">If</a> you look in front of Paul Revere's, they did the whole entire, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4758.109s">over</a> a couple of years ago, then they stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4760.39s">And</a> when they stopped, it was like asphalt, potholes, tree branches all ripped up and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4765.512s">And</a> it really didn't meet the goal of what we're really trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4769.133s">So</a> when it comes to like the intersection improvements, like here, it looks like you go out a lot further here than you do over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4774.895s">It</a> looks like you're not going too far over here, over there, over here, over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4778.176s">Which</a> area, your scope of work, your work area scope, I guess, I don't know what you want to call it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4804.69s">Okay,</a> so 40 feet is about that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4815.42s">I'm</a> just talking in general, not just this particular site, but so it's 40 feet for where the bus stop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4820.825s">And</a> then if it was going, that seems like you're moving all the bus stops up to the corners.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4831.75s">sidewalk</a> repairs on the corners as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4833.491s">How</a> far down on the corner are you gonna go?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4846.678s">And</a> what's the gradient? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4848.899s">The</a> appropriate gradient.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4955.68s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4958.302s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4959.002s">On</a> this location and on the Hastings lane location. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4963.575s">across</a> the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4965.356s">Hastings</a> Lane is a very difficult road to get out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4969.157s">I</a> grew up across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4970.117s">I</a> grew up on Whitman Road, so I could see Hastings Lane from my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4972.998s">I</a> live on Whitman Street now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4974.818s">I</a> drive through this intersection every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4976.658s">Cars</a> cannot get out of Hastings Lane as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4978.519s">The</a> closer you move that bus to the corner, the hotter it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4981.12s">So</a> if you're looking at where you're putting these two buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4983.478s">You're</a> moving one back closer to Woodman Street, one closer to Hastings Lane, so you're actually closing that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4987.902s">Other</a> way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4989.203s">Other</a> way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4989.744s">Am</a> I looking at this thing upside down? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4991.486s">No,</a> they're moving them farther away.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4994.809s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4996.01s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4996.671s">To</a> the dark blue circles. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4998.132s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4998.532s">I</a> was looking at it the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=4999.673s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5002.176s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5002.816s">These</a> are complicated directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5004.358s">I</a> mean, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=5004.998s">It's</a> a lot.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6043.754s">Director</a> of Transportation, done any community outreach to any of the neighborhoods about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6048.317s">Or</a> has this all been done through the MBTA's public participation process?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6123.587s">My</a> suggestion, Madam President, before we even take a position on this, that as a city, we do outreach to the residents that are going to be most affected by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6131.009s">We've</a> made preliminary recommendations that you can come back to us with their responses to those preliminary recommendations in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6136.631s">We</a> can do some outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6137.872s">It</a> seems to me like the city's done no outreach to any of the residents in the neighborhood, so this is going to factor impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6143.794s">Regardless</a> of whether or not it's a third-party project or not, I think if we're using Eversource as the baseline or the example, we better do it different than we did it with Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6151.577s">You</a> know, we've gotten a lot of pushback and a lot of calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6155.139s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6156.359s">The</a> Safer School Project from a lot of us that were in there, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6163.937s">So</a> I think if we're going to do this, Madam President, we should do our own due diligence as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6168.44s">We</a> will buy in a house, we wouldn't just take what the real estate agent was telling us, we'd do our own due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6173.485s">I</a> think that that's something that we need to do before we as a council take a position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6177.485s">I</a> certainly don't have any opposition to many of the proposals that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6181.168s">I</a> think it's something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6183.009s">Don't</a> get me wrong, but I also don't want to be the one that says, I can't believe you put that bus in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6187.273s">Oh,</a> I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6187.673s">You</a> had an opportunity to come to 100 meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6189.354s">You</a> knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6190.495s">We</a> reached out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6191.035s">We</a> did our due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6192.056s">I</a> think that's important, especially with the lack of communication that we've been receiving from the coroner office for the past three years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=6515.58s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7315.167s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7317.869s">Because</a> I mean, ultimately the moratorium would come into effect right for the street opening moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7321.912s">So</a> these people wouldn't be able to get the street gets closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7325.114s">They're</a> not gonna be able to open the street for five years to get gas into the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7328.617s">We</a> gotta address this before this happens.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7561.62s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=7562.3s">If</a> I could just reintroduce my motion that was made earlier in the evening during the public participation portion, that we reach out to the lead traffic engineer and to our representatives at EPSOS to see if the bike lanes that are taken with parking spots in front of those homes between Lawrence Road and High Street would be as a result of the mitigation package that was negotiated between the administration and the provider.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8312.317s">Vice</a> President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8312.897s">You're</a> here to the Council President as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8945.573s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8947.034s">I'm</a> very thankful that Attorney Austin has finally given us a legal opinion, because every time we ask her for something, she scratches her head and says, that's council prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8953.678s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8954.058s">I'll</a> look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8954.658s">I'll</a> check it out later. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8955.839s">But</a> finally, she gave us a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8958.481s">It</a> didn't answer the question that we asked, because we didn't ask her to look at the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8962.903s">We</a> asked her to look at the city ordinances, and we asked her to look at the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8966.926s">And</a> this opinion is very, very narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8970.648s">And</a> there's a reason it's very narrow, because it's not worth the paper it's written on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8974.975s">All</a> right, these ordinances that this council puts in place to ensure that there's a city solicitor put in place with the legislative intent to provide a check and balance on the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8987.204s">It's</a> a transparency issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8989.185s">First</a> and foremost, a transparency issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8993.388s">So</a> the mayor has the power to appoint somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8996.775s">She</a> hasn't appointed a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=8998.856s">She's</a> hired a private law firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9001.197s">She</a> said that her private law firm, the city ordinance say there shall be a solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9006.32s">It</a> doesn't say the mayor shall privately contract a firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9012.283s">It</a> says there shall be a solicitor and the solicitor will be compensated within the compensation schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9018.806s">The</a> same schedule that she brought to us this evening to create another pet job for one of her friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9024.602s">So</a> when I sit here and I look at this, Madam President, it makes my brains boil because she sat up here and she promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9031.724s">She</a> made a promise to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9033.745s">She</a> promised us something. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9036.346s">She</a> cut a deal and the deal was that we'd have an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9040.507s">So</a> whether her word isn't worth anything or just as much as the paper that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9047.209s">Austin</a> wrote her opinion on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9049.43s">But</a> it certainly doesn't carry any weight in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9052.611s">When</a> the mayor gives their word, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9055.638s">in</a> June. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9057.16s">And</a> here we are nine months later, and it still hasn't been carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9060.663s">Seven</a> elected fish, seven of seven of the what 14 elected officials in this community at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9067.79s">She</a> gives seven of us her word. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9070.533s">It</a> was a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9071.814s">It</a> was a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9073.436s">It</a> was a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9074.577s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9074.838s">It</a> wasn't it's hot hiring people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9076.86s">I've</a> never met a lawyer <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9079.034s">that</a> went to law school, that had their own firm and they practiced law, that doesn't know another lawyer, that wants a part-time job making $125,000 a year with health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9088.842s">I</a> don't know a lawyer in the world that wouldn't accept that job that's out in private practice, that's out working on their own, that's out and hung their own shingle. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9096.829s">I</a> don't know a lawyer in the world that wouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9100.973s">Maybe</a> she doesn't know any lawyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9102.434s">I</a> thought she went to law school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9104.336s">I</a> thought she practiced law. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9106.518s">I</a> don't understand how all of a sudden there's a shortage of lawyers in Medford, but not anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9111.144s">If</a> you do the math, there's one lawyer for every 1,200 people in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9118.252s">We</a> have 6 million people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9119.373s">You</a> do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9120.414s">You</a> do the math, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9121.495s">It's</a> nonsensical for us to sit here week in and week out and go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9125.78s">She's</a> treating us the same way she's treating the workers in this community, the same way she's treating the representative from local 25, the same way she's treating the representatives from Massachusetts Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9135.948s">All</a> right, she's going to keep us in the dark and she's going to try to control the narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9139.611s">And</a> that doesn't mean telling the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9141.732s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9142.133s">It</a> doesn't mean being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9144.833s">It</a> doesn't mean any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9146.614s">So</a> we can keep sitting here week in and week out and wasting our time, really wasting our time, because we don't have the tools to build the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9155.719s">We</a> don't have the tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9157.98s">She</a> promised us the tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9159.381s">She</a> agreed with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9160.602s">She</a> sat here for 20 years and cried. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9163.063s">Everything</a> was awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9163.944s">The</a> city was falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9165.024s">Mike</a> McGlynn's the demon. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9166.645s">Mike</a> McGlynn's the devil. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9167.826s">Roy</a> Belson's hell incarnated himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9171.445s">I</a> never met two hard-working public servants that weren't afraid to be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9175.328s">They</a> would come up here to this podium and answer the questions and give us the answers that we may not want to hear, but at least they showed up and they were present and they kept their word and they kept their promises. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9186.767s">And</a> enough's enough with this city solicitor nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9189.349s">We</a> don't have one, we need one, the ordinance say it's required. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9192.211s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9193.112s">Madam</a> Mayor, do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9194.413s">Who</a> can we even go to and say, what's our alternative? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9197.695s">I'd</a> like to speak to a lawyer to tell me what my alternative is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9200.857s">Can</a> I have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9201.518s">Austin's</a> number? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9202.058s">Hey,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9202.398s">Austin,</a> how do I get rid of you so that we can have a real city solicitor in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9207.602s">I</a> mean, come on, give me a break here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9209.223s">Enough's</a> enough with this nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9211.405s">It's</a> nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9212.746s">It's</a> nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9214.207s">That</a> door has not been opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9216.484s">They</a> said it's an open door, you can always walk in. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9218.486s">Well,</a> you can't walk in, it's not really open. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9220.427s">You</a> gotta call me and we gotta make an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9222.148s">But,</a> you know, we have an open door policy, but the door's not open. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9225.331s">I</a> don't even know what that means when she said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9226.952s">I</a> got a scratch on my head going, what's going on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9229.914s">It's</a> become so personal, so personal and so not about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9235.398s">When</a> it comes to the workers in this community and Steve South, when it comes to people getting taken out of here by the police, people getting followed around with GPS trackers on their vehicles, people being required to undergo psychiatric evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9248.526s">It's</a> personal, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9249.987s">That's</a> not government. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9251.207s">That's</a> not governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9252.588s">That's</a> politics and it's bad politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9255.19s">And</a> it translates into bad government. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9256.771s">And</a> that's what we have here in this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9259.292s">And</a> you know why we have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9260.173s">Because</a> we accept the chief administrative officer of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9265.297s">We</a> accept the fact that she came up here and lied, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9268.199s">Threw</a> her teeth to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9269.88s">We're</a> accepting that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9271.621s">We're</a> saying, OK, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9272.942s">Let's</a> move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9274.123s">What</a> are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9275.745s">Well,</a> let's ask her. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9276.685s">Oh,</a> she'll just lie again, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9278.327s">I</a> mean, enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9279.708s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9281.129s">What</a> are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9282.31s">What's</a> the recourse? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9283.491s">What's</a> the game? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9284.111s">What's</a> the end game here? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9285.652s">What's</a> the end game? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9286.973s">She</a> ain't going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9288.996s">We</a> know she's not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9291.277s">Because</a> her track record has proven that she will not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9293.618s">She</a> refuses to communicate openly and transparently with this council about legal issues and financial issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9303.022s">I</a> don't know what else is important to us, but we control the zoning, which is a legal issue, and we control the budget, which is a financial issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9309.205s">Other</a> than that, all we are is a bunch of cheerleaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9312.686s">All</a> we are is the rah-rah squad. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9315.02s">So</a> I'm at a loss at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9318.562s">The</a> lack of leadership that's come out of the corner office, the chief of staff doesn't come in to give us answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9324.086s">When's</a> the chief of staff have decided to give us an answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9325.987s">She</a> comes down to fight with us and yell and scream at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9328.549s">She</a> doesn't come down to give us answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9329.689s">She</a> comes down here to control narrative, control spin and not tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9332.892s">And</a> we've caught them so many times lying. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9334.953s">How</a> do they expect us to have a relationship of trust with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9338.055s">How?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9339.316s">How</a> is it possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9340.476s">That's</a> what I ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9341.973s">Again,</a> I think back to four years ago and how much better off this city was every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9348.034s">Every</a> single, when I drive over that same pothole that's been on my street that I put through see click fix 27 times, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9353.936s">I</a> think about how much better the city was four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9356.716s">And</a> it makes me sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9357.936s">It</a> makes me sad to see how terrible the city looks, lack of curb appeal, lack of commitment or investment to deliver in public service, to deliver in simple basic public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9370.185s">Like</a> fixing a sidewalk, taking down a tree, fixing a pothole, striping a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9379.19s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9380.111s">I</a> mean, when are we gonna wake up and realize that we're failing the people in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9383.713s">Because</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9384.514s">Because</a> when we go outside and we look around, it looks horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9387.395s">It</a> looks horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9388.196s">We</a> sat there and we listened to Mr. South tell us how Everett, Chelsea, Malden have passed us, how North Wedding, how Newton, how Waltham have passed us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9397.241s">And</a> he's not wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9399.28s">And</a> Stowe, Stowe, I know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9403.724s">There's</a> a golf course there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9406.346s">So</a> at the end of the day, Madam President, we need to shed some light on some of the issues that are going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9411.99s">And</a> the biggest failure that we have in Medford right now is the fact that we don't have a local newspaper to report on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9417.254s">We</a> have a communications director that gets paid $125,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9422.818s">to</a> create new stories and to create spin and put spin on them however they want, and to go on every single social media platform in the world and run a campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9432.957s">and</a> run a campaign, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9434.478s">Because</a> that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9435.498s">You</a> know, the big hunt going on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9437.399s">Looking</a> for Easter eggs up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9438.28s">It's</a> spawned in a couple of weeks now, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9440.041s">The</a> bunny's going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9441.742s">The</a> bunny's going to be, how are people going to get there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9447.084s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9448.165s">Is</a> it a recreation bunny? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9450.086s">Yeah,</a> the recreation bunny. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9451.186s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9451.787s">The</a> recreated bunny. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9454.328s">So</a> anyway, Madam President, as I've said, right, what's the end game here, we're going to keep talking about this and talking about this and talking about this, they're going to keep asking for money we're going to keep giving them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9465.396s">They're</a> going to keep asking for reclassifications we're going to keep giving them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9468.158s">We</a> got to stop, we're going to shut the water off at some point, it's at some point we got to turn the faucet off, and we got to say, come to the table and be serious with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9475.987s">And</a> quite frankly, unless we do that, they're not gonna be serious with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9479.848s">Because</a> every single group in this community that's organized, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9483.488s">I</a> look at us as like a bargaining unit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9485.289s">We're</a> the Medford City Council bargaining unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9487.809s">We're</a> getting treated worse than every other unit in the city, just about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9493.47s">Every</a> other one, because all those units are coming to us and asking us for leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9498.311s">And</a> asking us to say, what do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9499.771s">What</a> can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9500.611s">Help.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9501.471s">And</a> we look at them and we say, we don't have the tools to help you because the mayor led us to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9507.541s">And</a> that's where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9508.502s">So</a> we come down and we have two and three hour meetings and they give us a talk about what great crosswalks they're gonna paint on the NBA TA's dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9514.807s">None's</a> getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9516.569s">None's</a> getting done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9517.77s">30%</a> design, remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9518.891s">That</a> was 30% design. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9520.532s">All</a> that is is an idea right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9522.874s">That's</a> years from coming to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9526.137s">So</a> Madam President, I rest with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9529.48s">The</a> city ordinances say we need a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9532.102s">We</a> don't have a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9535.067s">Why</a> is the mayor found it okay to be a non-compliance with the ordinances of this community that are designed to be a check and balance against abuses of power? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9545.21s">That's</a> what I want people to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9547.85s">Thank</a> you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=9549.171s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10027.956s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10049.623s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10125.332s">Sorry.</a>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10184.654s">I</a> just once again like to recognize Councilor Falco for his work on this paper, Madam President, he was the one that started this and, you know, it's one of those things where you start some good work and you're not necessarily around to see it finished and I just want to be sure that he knows that we're thinking of him, and this is a great success and a great piece of legislation.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10262.913s">Madam</a> President, I do believe about three hours ago, we started a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10271.275s">And</a> when this meeting started, this room was filled <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10274.097s">filled</a> with workers that wrote the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10278.101s">Talked</a> about five bargaining units in the city side at least, plus police and fire, that's seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10284.287s">Seven</a> bargaining units without contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10287.049s">We</a> talked about transparency, we talked about finance, we talked about morale, we talked about the way workers are treated in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10299.468s">I</a> made a pretty strong statement, Madam President, saying that I don't think there should be any more reclassifications of positions or creations of new positions until these contracts get settled, until these working people get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10311.518s">The</a> existing employees that are doing the work now, that are going without a contract, a collective group of people, not just an individual, five bargaining units, all represented by one person, fighting every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10326.187s">for</a> groups and groups of people, just like we are, to get the same information that we're looking for, they can't attain. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10332.691s">I</a> don't think it's right and I don't think it's fair at this point in time that we bring this paper up, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10340.235s">I</a> think the gentleman's doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10341.696s">I</a> said that when this paper came up for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10344.698s">I</a> don't have a particular issue with the paper other than the fact of when it's presented, how it's been presented, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10352.781s">and</a> the ongoing situation with the labor and workforce here in the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10359.105s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I can't support this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10362.147s">I'd</a> like to, I'd like to support it in the near future, but I can't support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10366.57s">So</a> I'd ask that it remain on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10368.652s">I</a> know it's a contrary to the motion that's been made, but I might ask that it remain on the table until these contracts get adjusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10374.556s">It's</a> not fair to these working people. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10376.377s">It's</a> not fair for the mayor to pick and choose and pick and choose who's gonna get upgrades and who's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10383.964s">It's</a> just not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10384.724s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10385.265s">It's</a> not collective bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10386.746s">That's</a> not organizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10389.627s">That's</a> nepotism. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10391.128s">I</a> don't have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10393.669s">Again,</a> I don't have a problem with the individual that holds the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10396.271s">I</a> think he's doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10398.512s">But</a> at this point in time, I think that there are other people that are a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10402.134s">And</a> the mayor said that they don't have any money for raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10404.415s">And</a> the mayor said that she has double the amount of free cash that they've ever had in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10408.045s">That's</a> probably because we spent all our alpha money, but that's a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10411.266s">So</a> Madam President, with that being said, I think this paper should be on the table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10868.672s">It</a> was used on these one offs to give the personal people raises.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10875.656s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10887.547s">And</a> I'm just saying, you know, when the mayor was running her staunch campaign two years ago, she was very proud of this grant that they got from the Collins Center that was gonna be a compensation and classification study that we still have never seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10898.435s">But</a> the mayor has proposed how many one-off positions to get raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10903.479s">Well,</a> at the same time, stonewalling labor, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10908.202s">So</a> when we're putting the individual in front of labor, I think that's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10911.484s">When</a> we're putting the individual department head in front of the lowest paid workers, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10917.167s">in</a> this community, I think it's wrong, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10921.649s">So</a> when we talk about, you know, the difficulty to fill jobs, I think it has less to do with compensation and more to do with the fact that when you Google Medford, you see that people gotta undergo psych evaluations, people having GPS trackers put on their car, people are getting banned from city hall, people are getting taken out in handcuffs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10941.115s">I</a> think that's the stuff that deters people from coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10943.936s">The</a> people filing racial discrimination suits, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10947.873s">against</a> the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10948.774s">I</a> think those are more deterrent than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10952.916s">I</a> don't think the compensation is necessarily the biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10957.558s">So</a> when I look at this, I just say, I think it's backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10963.001s">I'm</a> not going to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10964.662s">And</a> it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10965.882s">I</a> mean, ultimately, we've been hearing about this grant since Dave Rodriguez was up there about the compensation study, but none of us have ever seen a copy of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10972.526s">But</a> the mayor has proposed I get at least seven, at least seven position upgrades and new jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10979.26s">Plus</a> whatever she created through the Apple money that we don't even know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10987.763s">Just</a> one last point. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=10989.444s">So</a> when we talk about the fact that you can't say that not approving this raise isn't good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11001.792s">How</a> do we know that when there's only a finite pool of money that we have to elevate the workers? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11006.735s">And</a> we're using this finite pool to elevate individuals versus collective bargaining organizations, groups that have ownership in their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11017.403s">It</a> seems to me like if you talk back, you don't get a race. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11020.525s">If</a> you're a loyal soldier, then you might get an upgrade, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11023.927s">That's</a> what it looks like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11024.768s">If</a> you fight for your rights, you're gonna be going to mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11028.591s">If</a> you keep your mouth shut and you're a loyal soldier, <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11031.91s">we're</a> gonna give you an upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11033.851s">If</a> you are the federal funds manager and you come before the council and you say, whoa, whoa, whoa, something's wrong here during the budget debates, you get fired. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11044.114s">So</a> those are the things that I look at when I talk about fairness and the way that it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11048.315s">But</a> again, you guys know where I stand on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11050.596s">I've</a> talked about it too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11051.516s">I</a> rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11052.197s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11088.853s">Point</a> of information just on that, my buddy Biggie, I think it was Biggie Small, more money, more problems, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11093.476s">I</a> don't think, more money's not gonna make any happier, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11095.898s">It's</a> just gonna make you better compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11097.719s">But</a> if the environment's hostile, right, how do you address it? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11101.662s">Oh,</a> yeah, take more money and let me be evil to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11103.383s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11104.684s">I</a> don't think that makes sense either.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11191.364s">Just</a> one point of privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11193.464s">I</a> think it's also a point to point out that this isn't the race. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11195.964s">This</a> position is going to get upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11197.965s">Then</a> it's going to get the raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11199.245s">And</a> then the question is, are these raises retroactive? <a href="https://youtu.be/1MmmUyIRaFo&t=11202.186s">Or</a> do the raises only begin when we create the position?<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_sVx7vl5ZjhU/2024-10-05_sVx7vl5ZjhU.html">City Council 03-21-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=294.784s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=296.245s">Growing</a> up in West Medford, I too had the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=299.973s">Knowing</a> Joan Gatto for a number of years, I grew up with her daughter, Julie, and I actually was at her daughter, Julie's wedding when she married my dear close friend, David Topper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=308.939s">And</a> over the years, she's been a fixture in the West Medford community, a fixture at the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=312.742s">Raphael's</a> Parish, and someone that's always been willing to put herself out there for the community, a volunteer, someone that puts her money where her mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=321.228s">She</a> puts community first. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=322.309s">And</a> when you go down to her muffin shop in West Medford, you can see that it's a place where relationships are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=328.017s">where</a> communities developed, and it's really something that makes Medford a great place. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=331.2s">It's</a> really something that helps build the fabric of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=334.303s">So</a> I thank her for all the work that she's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=336.445s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello said, the chamber couldn't have picked a better selection this year, and I congratulate her.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=523.817s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=525.118s">Yes,</a> this is a request for the administration to provide us with a dollar for dollar breakdown relative to all upper expenditures to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=531.043s">It's</a> been brought to my attention that there was some concerns relative to the way that our funds are being expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=537.728s">When</a> we had our previous federal funds manager in place and that's my understanding that there's some litigation that's going on relative to the separation of the prior federal funds manager in the city right now, related to some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=551.863s">directives</a> that she had received and whether or not they fell within the compliance of the operative directives that were issued by the Feds. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=557.446s">So</a> what I'm asking for is a dollar for dollar breakdown to be sure that the money is being spent in accord with the federal requirements, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=563.909s">Ultimately,</a> there are certain places that money can't be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=566.63s">For</a> example, it can't be spent for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=569.051s">So</a> I'd just like to be sure that the money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=571.773s">It</a> was a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=572.813s">We</a> spent a lot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=574.274s">It</a> seems like the man wants to spend a lot more of it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=576.795s">So</a> if that's the case, I want to be sure that we have a strong financial auditing and accounting of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=601.904s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=603.124s">These</a> aren't the run-of-the-mill portals. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=605.286s">These,</a> I think Mike, if you fell into it, you'd end up in Australia. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=608.468s">These</a> are the deepest portals I've ever seen in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=610.51s">They're</a> definitely something that could damage public safety vehicles, ambulances, police cars, fire engines, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=616.734s">We've</a> seen tonight that we already have a request from the administration to spend some money to purchase some new public safety vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=622.879s">And</a> I think it would be safe to say that the conditions of our roadway have an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=626.81s">on</a> the wear and tear of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=628.431s">These</a> departments operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and the conditions of our roads have a direct impact on the quality of our vehicles and the longevity of their routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=638.418s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I ask that the administration go down there in the interest of public safety and take care of these puddles.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=661.103s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=662.444s">Yes,</a> on Doonan Street, a washing machine, looks like a living room set, bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=666.846s">We're</a> all spread out between those, say number 16 in the corner of Highland Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=670.868s">So</a> when you take a look at what's transpired, let's say around February 28th, this was reported through C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=678.652s">Around</a> March 7th, it was acknowledged by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=682.133s">And</a> to date, as recently as two days ago, the resident has said that those materials still lie outside their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=691.76s">So</a> I'm hoping the administration will get on this as promptly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=694.762s">This</a> is an illegal dumping issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=695.943s">It's</a> not something that's uncommon throughout our community, especially on roadways that abut state-owned and controlled roads, especially on properties that are French properties on the Metro Malden line as well, and that's some of the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=706.17s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask that the administration take the necessary steps to address it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1371.629s">Madam</a> President, I just ask that on a second, a side note or a side motion that this paper be sent to a director of the Board of Health to see what impact if this paper is passed at the state level, <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1384.027s">what</a> impact it will have on our road and control ordinance here in the city of Medford, and whether or not we can take the steps that are raised in this ordinance at the local level, because that's really what we are as local officials, not state officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1396.016s">We</a> all know how I feel about sending this stuff up to the state house if they're not gonna give us money, or we're not asking for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1401.759s">But</a> with that being said, if we could send it to our Director of the Board of Health, so that they could review our existing ordinance to see how that complies.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1526.866s">So</a> that's just my update on that counter night, Madam President, I was wondering why it's taken 10 months since the mayor sat up here and told us that we were going to be able to get an assistant city solicitor and continue our zoning work but I think you answered the question it's been time Alicia is involved so of course it's going to be 10 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1543.258s">Right,</a> but ultimately the zoning falls under the purview of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1547.499s">All</a> right, and this is something we requested 10 months ago, and this was part of the deal that we made we negotiated settlement of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1552.981s">So</a> here we are now with two months left in the fiscal year, right two I'm sorry two months left in the calendar year and 10 months ago we made this deal, and we still move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1561.384s">All</a> right, so it's just another indicator. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1563.368s">that</a> the administration is not going to cooperate with city council just another indicated the administration is not willing to provide us with the tools that we need to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1569.852s">The</a> administration needs the hand and everything they need to control everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1574.195s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1575.456s">I</a> can't believe that we were able to get the zoning actually I can't believe it you know why because it was under the prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1580.779s">That's</a> why we're able to get the zoning completed that we got completed because the process started under a prior administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1585.332s">Under</a> this administration, we have not been given any transparency or any of the things that we have promised. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1589.613s">And</a> it's ridiculous that Councilor Caraviello needs to bring this up now, 10 months after the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1594.014s">As</a> we sit here and we wait, we twiddle our thumbs and say, when can we get to work on the issues that really matter to this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1598.835s">On</a> the issues that are gonna generate revenue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1601.535s">On</a> the issues that are gonna create jobs and on the issues that are gonna be the bridge to our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1608.157s">I</a> thank the gentleman for bringing it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1664.194s">But</a> to that point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1666.075s">Why</a> is it growing into something that needs to go to the RFP process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1668.997s">When</a> it's legal contract, it's legal services contract, doesn't need to go out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1671.859s">We</a> know we want Mike Wabrowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1674.0s">Now</a> we're going down this road, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1675.561s">We're</a> going down this road because they're trying to grab a job out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1677.582s">They're</a> trying to create a new position out of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1784.394s">I</a> mean, I made the motion Madam President, I made the motion for us to go down the coast of reclassification and not rezoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1791.697s">I</a> did it and I made the motion and I believe the motion said as phase one of a two part project and that was then. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1797.0s">Right,</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1799.461s">So</a> what I'm saying is what the heck, what's going on with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1803.343s">What</a> is going on in the time that they've been elected, they haven't had a full staff of senior officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1809.447s">And</a> over three years, they haven't had a full complement of senior staff.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1836.544s">I'm</a> not asking her to do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1838.645s">But</a> I'm asking the assistant city solicitor that the mayor said she was gonna hire to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1842.145s">And</a> she said she was gonna do that in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1843.846s">And</a> here we are in what, March now, we still wanna have the assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=1847.946s">I'm</a> not asking director Hunt to do anything.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2066.883s">If</a> it's the first and the third, I'm good, but you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2069.504s">Then</a> if we're supposed to be off the second, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2071.425s">I</a> get some childcare issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2072.325s">I</a> have a young family, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2073.545s">So</a> I'm trying to do the best I can, but I can always come on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2076.167s">So</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=2076.927s">But</a> Wednesday shouldn't be a problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3485.578s">Madam</a> President, um, you know, I really don't think this should be about politics at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3491.0s">Right,</a> it should be about the city of Medford, and what's the best course for our city, what's our city's best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3496.102s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3496.882s">And</a> ultimately, you know, Council of business right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3500.643s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3501.403s">I</a> don't think this is bad politics though. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3503.504s">I</a> think this is bad governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3505.445s">That's</a> what I think I think it's bad governing I don't think it's bad politics, I think it's bad governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3509.727s">All</a> right, it's not political at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3511.508s">It's</a> not political at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3512.749s">It's</a> bad governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3514.13s">It's</a> bad governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3515.211s">And</a> bad governing leads to bad outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3517.432s">And</a> that's what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3518.593s">So</a> when I sit here and I think back, am I better off now living in the city of Medford than I was four years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3522.516s">What</a> do I say to myself? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3524.317s">What</a> do I say to myself? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3525.858s">I</a> say, we have teachers taking a vote of no confidence in the school committee and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3528.921s">We</a> got kids in our schools getting stabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3530.842s">Every</a> street you drive down, you can't even, you can't avoid a pothole if you wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3536.046s">We're</a> failing in the delivery of city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3539.242s">We</a> haven't had one successful construction project since Mayor Burke closed the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3544.306s">We're</a> bringing out a brand new plan, a brand new plan for Medford Square that they took off the shelf when Stephanie left, blew the dust off of and said, it's mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3555.774s">Is</a> that it right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3559.076s">Exact</a> same proposal that was there from before, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3564.827s">You</a> know, it's not bad politics, it's bad governing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3568.05s">And</a> bad governing leads to bad outcomes, and that's what we're stuck with right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3761.929s">I</a> do believe the paper before us as to whether or not we want to have a committee of the whole, no more, no less.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=3861.642s">My</a> point here is, if anyone will share what type of communications with this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4345.186s">This</a> administration has been horrible to the working people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4348.727s">Absolutely</a> horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4350.488s">All</a> right, absolutely horrible to say it's all Steve salts, making stuff up is an absolute joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4356.449s">An</a> absolute joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4357.75s">They're</a> putting GPS trackers on people's personal vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4360.631s">They're</a> hiring private investigators. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4362.091s">It's</a> absolutely they just drove their own HR director out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4365.432s">Come</a> on, continue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4424.53s">I</a> believe I'm a Councilor and this is a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4426.952s">And</a> as a Councilor, I have what they call a bully pulpit. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4429.373s">All</a> right, I have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4430.713s">And</a> that comes with the honor and privilege of being elected to represent the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4435.856s">I</a> need 5,000 votes and I got them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4437.757s">She</a> only needs one, the mayor, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4439.718s">All</a> right, so the only person she reports to is the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4441.879s">But</a> the people that I report to are the taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4444.48s">I</a> don't get in my car and drive to my suburb.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=4499.544s">Does</a> that mean that the administration will not be giving us that report?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6310.794s">Point</a> taken, I hope you do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6315.756s">Madam</a> President, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6318.336s">Tim,</a> this is a paper that I think you're well aware I've supported in the past, I've led debates on in the past in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6325.698s">I</a> think it's something that we need, as Councilor Caraviello said, and I too share the same concerns that he has. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6331.019s">I</a> know the city needs it, but as someone <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6334.602s">who's</a> very concerned about the lack of fiscal transparency and financial constraint that we have in the city, about our administration's inability to provide us with simple documentation as to where they're spending their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6347.667s">And</a> we've been waiting since January of 2020 to get that and still haven't received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6353.189s">Speaks</a> volumes, speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6355.23s">Everybody</a> says when you can't get an answer to something, you follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6359.011s">And</a> for three years, I've been trying to follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6362.196s">and</a> I'm getting stonewalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6363.556s">And</a> I don't know why, I don't know why, but it leads me to believe that there's something strange going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6369.618s">The</a> fish is rotting in Denmark or whatever they say, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6372.179s">Now,</a> I think you're doing an excellent job and I think you've done a great job with that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6375.7s">And</a> I think you've really moved it ahead, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6379.141s">And</a> my vote this evening has nothing to do with you, with the job you're doing or with the department you run. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6386.523s">My</a> job really has to do with the fact that, you know, the first day, <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6390.542s">of</a> January, when we all stood behind this rail, the first thing that we did was we raised our right hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6395.984s">And</a> we raised our right hand and we said that we're gonna do our best to uphold the Constitution in the United States of America, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ordinances in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6405.548s">So</a> we sit here and we look at this paper that's before us and it's a loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6408.549s">So</a> this is a loan order, it needs five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6412.703s">per</a> state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6414.104s">Pursuant</a> to city ordinances, the city shall have a city solicitor, and the city solicitor is responsible for reviewing all legal instruments, a loan owner being one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6422.327s">We</a> have no city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6423.968s">So</a> we have no city solicitor that's here that works for the people of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6427.53s">We</a> have a private law firm that's already come forward and said they work for the administration, but we have no attorney or solicitor for this community that works for the people of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6435.894s">All</a> right, and that's been stated by legal counsel that we're paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6439.655s">I</a> don't know how much we're paying them, <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6441.885s">Some</a> have set up to $2.7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6445.348s">KP</a> law has been paid so far this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6448.93s">That's</a> a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6449.471s">I</a> don't know if it's true or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6450.712s">I'd</a> love to know if it is or not, because I've been asking for the paperwork to look at it, but I just can't seem to get my hands on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6455.836s">So</a> ultimately, you know, we have a lack of fiscal transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6459.418s">We</a> have an administration that comes forward for job classification changes every other week to create new positions and give certain and select individuals raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6466.804s">All</a> right, so when I'm sitting down and I want to look at the full financial picture of this community and what's going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6471.228s">And</a> I wanna say to myself, this is where the money's going and this is where it's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6474.91s">I</a> can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6476.291s">So</a> it's very difficult for me to sit down and take a vote for $1.5 million of borrowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6484.215s">This</a> isn't our money that we're spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6485.435s">This</a> is money that we're asking somebody to give us that we're gonna have to pay back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6489.337s">All</a> right, so it's very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6492.939s">I</a> feel like you're a sacrificial lamb sometimes when you come down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6495.5s">I</a> know that you're working with one hand behind your back and I know that this stuff would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6498.882s">But</a> I also know that as <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6502.633s">a</a> financial stalwart for the taxpayers of this community, the people in the city deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6510.277s">So</a> it's very difficult for me to take a vote where I'm not confident that it complies with the ordinances in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6517.96s">And</a> I'm not so certain as to what our actual fiscal picture is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6523.583s">It</a> makes it very difficult for me to make this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6525.924s">And</a> I know what's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6527.105s">The</a> next time somebody calls the mayor's office and they say, I need my sidewalk fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6530.126s">Well,</a> the city council voted against the money, so you just got the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6533.369s">That's</a> what it's gonna be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6534.31s">Because</a> it's not about governance, it's about politics, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6540.454s">We</a> went over this already. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6541.795s">It's</a> about politics, not governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6544.196s">Governance</a> versus politics is a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6548.419s">So</a> for those reasons, I can't support the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=6551.801s">I'd</a> like to see a table for 90 days and maybe we can take it back up in June.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=7030.155s">Madam</a> President, motion to suspend the rules to take the fire engine paper, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8128.148s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8129.909s">Can</a> anybody tell me what titles are covered under this before us this evening?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8146.04s">It's</a> kind of important for us to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8147.661s">Go</a> ahead.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8159.785s">I</a> don't know how you'd like to- I'll be honest with you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8164.187s">You're</a> asking us to spend 80,000 bucks on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8386.775s">I</a> appreciate the financial transparency and the fiscal constraint that the administration has shown us by offering this paper with such a paperwork that supports it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8395.177s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8420.045s">Well,</a> we can separate, but I have a legal question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8422.708s">I</a> don't think we can vote for our own raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8423.909s">I</a> think we need to vote for a raise to go if it's for this body that we serve on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8427.411s">I</a> don't think we can vote for it in this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8428.753s">I</a> think it has to be a term that we're not in or it's an ethics violation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8472.616s">Oh,</a> that's what this is photo proof of first reading and we didn't have a print out of the names on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8477.06s">I'm</a> saying this is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8479.703s">I</a> feel like we've been kind of, they kind of tried to pull the rug underneath our feet here and stick a paper in front of our face to give the mayor a raise and never said it was for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8487.431s">And</a> now all of a sudden, we're finding out that the 11th hour, Madam Chief of Staff, do you have your hand raised.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=8552.424s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9460.152s">It's</a> never going to get worse bad politics is not going to translate the bad governance, we're going to make sure that you guys are safe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9609.322s">Tim.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9610.002s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9611.143s">We</a> absolutely stink at street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9616.147s">We</a> are awful at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9617.609s">It</a> is something we are not good at in this city at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9620.831s">I'm</a> looking at this expense and I'm seeing it total more than half of the total expenses before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9625.455s">I'd</a> like to see us get 10 trucks and forget the street sweeper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9630.28s">Quite</a> frankly, I don't see any value in the program that we're running right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9634.721s">I</a> think it can be done much better and probably cheaper privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9639.703s">You</a> know, so when I look at this and streets we've been since since you've been here, since you've lived in the city street sweep has been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9645.604s">We</a> are not good at it this twice a year thing is a waste in my opinion I don't think it does anything to help beautify the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9651.566s">I</a> don't think that it really meets any objectives and goals other than <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9654.707s">making</a> people totally angry because of the notification system and the getting told I'm not getting told some streets do some streets don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9661.431s">It's</a> just a haphazard application. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9664.173s">You</a> know, you're in zone one today and we're doing the best we can with what we got without the full blown program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9669.896s">We're</a> just not good at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9671.237s">We're</a> just not good at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9672.518s">Is</a> there you know, I'm one that would never say send something out <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9676.702s">unless</a> we're replacing it with something we're doing in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9678.903s">But</a> I'm thinking the amount of money and funds that we spend on the Street Sweeper program could probably be better invested if we gave it, put it out, it could probably be cheaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9687.607s">And</a> then we could do more internally, hiring more equipment and trucks and plows and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9693.569s">I</a> mean, I'm looking at this and I'm saying, the thing really, it comes out twice a year, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9698.572s">The</a> Street Sweeper?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9706.366s">But</a> I live on a main drag, and I'm gonna tell you, last year it didn't come out every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9710.909s">The</a> year before that, it didn't come out every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9713.231s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9713.671s">Because</a> I live on a main drag.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9715.852s">There's</a> a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9716.853s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9717.753s">So</a> why can't I, so I get a pack of restrictions on my street, it's supposed to get swept, but it doesn't get swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9723.597s">But</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=9725.098s">It's</a> not a good program.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10143.018s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10144.359s">This</a> paper that's before us this evening is attached to a paper that we voted on previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10148.44s">The</a> paper that we voted on previously requires three readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10151.461s">So</a> I'd ask that in the paper that we voted on previously, we amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10155.402s">So</a> the dollar figure is not gonna be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10156.862s">So</a> I'd ask that this paper be tabled and that the administration give us an amended paper that reflects the appropriate dollar figure based upon the vote that the council took earlier, excluding the mayor's office and the city council from the cost of living adjustment that the mayor's office proposed for themselves.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10858.928s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight, Madam President, thank you very much and I think the administration putting this paper on this paper reflects a resolution that I had filed back in 2018 when I requested that the Burke administration create a stabilization fund, and I'm the basis behind that request at the time was that it was the best practice of municipal government is published by the Massachusetts, Massachusetts Municipal Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10879.515s">as</a> well as GAAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10881.136s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10881.496s">But</a> what they also said was that as part of this best practice is that you should put between five and 8% of your total operating expenses into the stabilization account. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10890.201s">So</a> right now we have a $200 million operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10893.523s">So</a> 5% to 8% of that would be anywhere between 10 to $16 million for us to make this a sustainable account for stabilization purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10901.965s">So</a> I think this misses the mark a little bit here, Madam President, and I too also feel as though we need to have a meeting to talk about a little bit further in depth, because if we're going to go through the process of creating a stabilization account, we want to make sure that it's viable and that it meets the standards of best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10915.169s">Ultimately,</a> this is a bank account, it's a savings account is all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10918.41s">And</a> if you want to take money out of it, you're going to have to get a two thirds vote from the council to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10922.471s">So</a> I think this is a good thing, quite frankly, because I think, you know, it only takes four votes to spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10928.32s">to</a> get it out of this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10929.141s">So</a> that's something that I think is beneficial to the taxpayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10933.104s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the council for bringing up the motion to send this to a committee of the whole and I look forward to discussing the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=10938.287s">I'm</a> excited about seeing it finally come to the floor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11021.584s">That</a> wasn't a motion to amend the paper to $1, was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11023.485s">For</a> the administration?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11027.207s">That's</a> the mayor's paper, so I don't know if the mayor was amending the paper to $1. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11034.092s">I</a> misunderstood, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11184.768s">Madam</a> President, I believe we're coming off, maybe a second or third 10 year contracts with our rubbish hauler right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11192.252s">And</a> I just like to request a copy of the legal opinion from the city solicitor that says that we're required to take this vote, because I believe we've taken this vote previous previous Council's taken this vote that votes dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11202.945s">So</a> the city solicitor could provide us with a legal opinion and as we stated the city solicitor is required to approve all these contracts to form the city is also required to approve all legal instruments in this matter before us here is a legal instrument so I'm hoping the city solicitor can give us an opinion as to whether or not they feel as well this council has to take this vote or whether or not the previous vote the previous councils have taken still stands, because this is going to come up on other matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11226.3s">We</a> have a trash contract we have a cable contract for example, which is another one that comes up in the council in the past has given the authority to the mayor to enter into these 10 year contracts it was one vote that was both stood in perpetuity until the council rescinded that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11239.93s">So</a> I just asked if we could get that legal opinion as to whether or not the council spinning his wheels there and doing something that's already done, whether or not our city solicitor is provided can provide us with a legal opinion
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11253.471s">Oh,</a> I think that there is a standing legal opinion from a prior city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11257.712s">And</a> we have a public records retention law, so I'm pretty sure that that opinion would stand because that was the solicitor and we don't have one now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11434.027s">a</a> date on it, one of the people in the text club puts a date on it, it'll, it'll happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11437.83s">But</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11438.63s">I</a> know if I do it, I'm not going to get a date, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11440.452s">I'm</a> not going to get any information from this administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11520.514s">Set</a> a precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11521.935s">Anyway.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11522.915s">So</a> every other paper that ever came would set a precedent now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11525.316s">So</a> every other authority that we ever gave for contracts longer than three years, they'll have to come back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11529.477s">So</a> it'll set a precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11531.197s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11531.837s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11532.317s">So</a> that's the cable contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11533.878s">That</a> was the parking contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11535.738s">That</a> was, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11536.518s">That's</a> the trash contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=11538.179s">So</a> it has an effect.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12133.659s">I</a> mean, the issue that's really before us here and the only thing that we as a body can do is authorize the mayor to enter into a contract that's in excess of 36 months or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12143.526s">All</a> right, if we authorize her that power we authorize that power if we don't, we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12147.589s">Ultimately,</a> if we give her the 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12151.103s">or</a> whatever term that we deem appropriate, the mayor is still the chief negotiator in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12156.406s">So</a> it's not like we can say, oh, we don't like this, and we don't like that, and we don't like this, take that out of the contract, and we're gonna give you the 10 years, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12163.57s">It's</a> either, she's the one that negotiates the contract, she's the chief negotiator, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12166.992s">So</a> when this happened with the parking contract, it turned into a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12170.034s">And</a> the reason it turned into a nightmare was because we're not gonna give you the approval to enter into the contract, unless you take this out, unless you put this in, unless you do this, unless you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12176.978s">We</a> took over the role of the chief negotiator, and it turned into a disaster, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12179.939s">It</a> was an absolute disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12181.22s">So</a> ultimately, the only issue that's before us is whether or not we want to allow the mayor to enter with a contract that exceeds the term of 36 months, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12187.122s">At</a> this point in time, I'm not comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12189.242s">And</a> I think that's really the issue, that's the only issue that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12193.223s">I'm</a> not comfortable taking that vote because I don't know legally what the ramifications are, but I'm very concerned about what could happen when we give her that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12201.726s">What</a> happens if we give the authority to enter into a 10-year contract and now next thing you know, we're paying a trash fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12210.669s">Right</a> now we have free trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12211.85s">Other</a> communities have a trash fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12214.753s">And</a> we just gave her the authority to do that for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12216.594s">Maybe</a> the term's not going to be so favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12218.035s">So</a> those are the things we got to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12219.557s">And</a> right now in this stage in the game, I'm not too keen on thinking about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12223.06s">I</a> think that the administration should put out the RFPs and let's see what comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12226.302s">Because</a> most likely what's going to come back is an RFP that's going to say, we want 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12229.965s">Can</a> you get the vote?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12251.751s">There</a> is nobody in this building that can give us, hello, any legal opinion in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12256.912s">Nobody</a> in this building can give us a legal opinion as to whether or not we can even do that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12415.879s">We</a> don't need to make it this big, long-drawn-out thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12418.66s">We'll</a> table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12419.24s">Someone</a> takes a motion, take it off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12420.7s">It</a> comes off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12421.441s">We</a> don't need to turn it into this big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12422.721s">I</a> mean, if they get us a legal opinion, they get us a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/sVx7vl5ZjhU&t=12425.222s">Not</a> sure we're gonna get it, but...

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=221.961s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=223.502s">I'd</a> like to echo the sentiments of my fellow Councilors, Paul Howard was a great man, I someone that I had the pleasure of getting to know at a very young age picture Mr. Howard. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=234.842s">50</a> plus years old, playing full court basketball at Carr Park with, you know, 20, 25 kids between the ages of 15 and 25 years old and absolutely dominating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=246.288s">Paul</a> was an amazing athlete. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=249.25s">His</a> accolades on the basketball court for Somerville High School back in the 50s and early 60s is something that I talked about very, very fondly to this day among my father and his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=259.195s">And</a> whenever Paul Howard's name come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=261.836s">They</a> always speak of his work ethic and the type of gentleman that he was, just a kind man that went to work, put his head down and did the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=269.603s">He's</a> someone that's going to be sadly missed in this community, and I'm very lucky that I had the opportunity to call him a friend.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3966.458s">Separate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3967.899s">Just</a> one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3968.479s">Okay,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4159.0s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4160.441s">First</a> of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion to seven amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4164.355s">And</a> second Council business motion to approve the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4169.824s">After</a> taking a how to look at the amendments that he's made I don't see any reason to seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4174.555s">This</a> is something that I think we need to also thank our friend john Falco for because Council Falco was the person that kicked this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4182.481s">And</a> this wouldn't have gotten as far as it had if it weren't for john's diligence and john's work on this particular issue when he served as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4191.607s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper and I thank the gentleman for his amendments.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4312.606s">Don't</a> encourage me, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5158.979s">I'd</a> love to speak, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5163.9s">The</a> paper before us is a paper where I question whether or not it's in proper form. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5169.802s">If</a> we look at the Medford City Council rules, Rule 30 will read that every order before a bond issue shall <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5179.068s">before</a> its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of its findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5189.391s">The</a> city solicitor is a position established by ordinance, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5194.732s">Section</a> 2-651, city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5197.052s">There</a> shall be a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5199.373s">We</a> don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5201.193s">Section</a> 2-654, duties to legal instruments of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5208.112s">The</a> city solicitor shall advise and cause to be drafted bonds and other legal instruments of whatever as required by the mayor or the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5216.179s">Again,</a> the city solicitor did not draft this paper because we do not have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5222.425s">KP</a> law is time and time again, confirm that they are not the city's attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5227.329s">They</a> are the mayor's private legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5230.512s">Their</a> client is the mayor, no more, no less. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5234.841s">I</a> question as to whether or not this paper meets the legal standard of merit and would move to have it sent to the Office of the Attorney General for an independent review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6486.907s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6489.367s">To</a> that point, Councilor Benson, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6494.008s">Can</a> KP law serve as the assistant city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6496.709s">Because</a> based upon the ordinance that this council passed at some point in time, it says there shall be a city solicitor, and there shall also be an assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6504.831s">And</a> when there is no city solicitor, the assistant shall be appointed solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6509.235s">That's</a> what the ordinance says. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6511.497s">So</a> can the mayor unilaterally hire a law firm to work and be compensated at a rate of pay and a scale of pay far outside the compensation schedule that's established by the ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6524.767s">I</a> don't think she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6525.748s">I</a> don't think she can appoint a law firm into a position that's defined by ordinance with a salary attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6530.925s">And</a> we have to, at some point, bring this to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6533.947s">You</a> know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now, we sat here and we debated a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6538.629s">And</a> like you said, the mayor said, oh, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6540.59s">We're</a> going to have assistant city solicitor for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.331s">We're</a> going to post it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.991s">It's</a> going to be an in-house position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6544.972s">We</a> still don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6546.233s">And</a> we still don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6547.134s">That</a> was all smoke to get the budget passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6549.335s">You</a> know, the mayor never had any intention of filling that position because if she did, it would be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6554.057s">Um,</a> you know, so that's, that's why I raised the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6556.699s">I</a> mean, we, we have no guidance whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6560.345s">You</a> know, we're like the clown show, you know, we sit here and we talk and we have great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6565.79s">And,</a> you know, we want to follow through and we'd be very productive if we had the tools that were necessary to get the job done, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6573.458s">And</a> it's very frustrating to not have those tools, especially when we have such a talented group of people that could do such good work, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6581.486s">So,</a> you know, it's time we bring this thing to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6585.959s">does</a> the city of Medford require a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6588.4s">The</a> ordinance says it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6589.86s">I</a> don't know why there isn't one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6591.001s">And</a> if we don't have one, then there's a problem because there hasn't been one for quite a long period of time, which means that we're operating outside the ordinance, outside the defined parameters of how our government's supposed to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6604.825s">You</a> know, that's like saying there's supposed to be a secretary of state, but we're just not going to have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6613.928s">So</a> that's why I raised it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6615.83s">And</a> to the point of the paper before us, I support the paper and its theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6621.134s">We</a> need this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6622.275s">We</a> need these jobs to be able to be performed in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6626.018s">We</a> need to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6627.439s">But</a> we also have $700,000 of a $1.5 million appropriation that we made last year that still remains unspent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6634.365s">You</a> know, so in that regard, I think that, you know, we're not going to be in that bad of shape to put this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6639.969s">You</a> know, we want to wait a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6641.029s">We're</a> not going to get a response in a week or two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6642.67s">We're</a> not going to get a response by March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6644.551s">You</a> know, you know, it's going to take at least 30 days to get a legal response from the attorney general's office, you know, but, you know, it has to come to a head at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6652.976s">You</a> know, when I support the paper that's before us, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6656.139s">You</a> look at the capital plan, you know, you see these things in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6658.942s">So</a> it's not something that we haven't planned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6661.824s">You</a> look at the funding sources, that's a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6663.566s">You</a> know, when you look at the funding sources in the capital plan, most of it says that it's going to be general fund debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6668.831s">It's</a> not going to be something that's borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6670.632s">So,</a> you know, that's where in lies the rub. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6673.635s">But</a> ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6676.104s">In</a> theory, it's a good paper, but in terms of process and procedure, this is something that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6681.605s">And</a> I think that this is a way that we can do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7227.405s">We</a> did say that during the budget hearings that we didn't like the setup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7230.408s">And</a> that's why we agreed to pass a budget when the mayor said that she was going to provide us with an assistant city solicitor that works in the building for the city council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7378.478s">Yeah,</a> it's not a big deal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7384.739s">Motion,</a> keep them all together, we can vote them as one package.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7393.425s">approval</a> as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7395.106s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7462.709s">Madam</a> President, we're into suspension.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7468.204s">We</a> also have paper 23057 which is really similar subject matter, and that circumstance we had an opinion from the acting city solicitor at the time was in house in our city solicitor will give us an opinion relative to the way that these promotional advancements and salary increases should be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7485.034s">We</a> then received an opinion from KP law and then a revised opinion from KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7488.776s">again,</a> KP Lawyers stated that they're not the city's attorney, they're the mayor's private attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7492.479s">They've</a> given us two contrary legal opinions to the standing and acting legal city solicitor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7497.343s">So,</a> you know, we're kind of in the same circumstance with this paper that we were in the others.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7516.277s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7619.924s">No,</a> as previously stated, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7622.245s">I</a> think the gentleman's doing great work, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7623.606s">Don't</a> get me wrong.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8469.41s">I</a> prefer a motion to table till third reading on the underlying ordinance, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8475.43s">Certainly</a> a paper I'm going to support funding if the underlying position passes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8490.581s">Those</a> withdraw the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8569.567s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8575.11s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8878.367s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8946.088s">Yes,</a> Madam President, it's been brought to my attention that parking enforcement vehicles aren't garage in the state, even nevermind the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8953.638s">I've</a> seen the vehicles driving around town with the nice fancy city of Medford sticker on it says parking enforcement on it, parking enforcement officers are in it but other vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8962.229s">are</a> not registered in the state of Massachusetts or in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8966.773s">So</a> I believe that was a criteria in our previous contract with Republic Parking, and I see no reason why these vehicles shouldn't be both garaged and insured in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nevermind the city of Medford.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9051.567s">That</a> was pretty good, all in one breath, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9053.909s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9054.689s">Well,</a> ultimately, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some unauthorized clear-cutting of forestry between the community garden and the dog park, say, going down to the waterfront over by Homel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9067.859s">It's</a> caused a little bit of disruption to our ecosystem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9071.081s">The</a> matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of Energy and Environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9075.684s">Dennis</a> McDougal has been involved in the <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9080.825s">examination</a> and restoration of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9082.826s">The</a> police department has also been contacted relative to the circumstances, but the clear-cutting persists, Madam President, so this is something that I'm hoping we can get ahead of, take a look at, maybe do some intervention, educate some people in the community about the dangers of clear-cutting forestry, especially abutting the Mystic River watershed, and maybe move forward and restore some of the damage that has been done to further beautify the area that's utilized by so many in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9128.122s">That</a> I do not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9129.082s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9344.552s">So</a> on the motion of Councilor Madam President, Madam President, I'm gonna throw the motion on the questions been asked and answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9349.215s">You</a> know, it seems like everything that we were going to request they've already done.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9377.635s">Madam</a> President's rather self explanatory, as you'll know, on ramps and off ramps to 9316 and the like are in some rough shape, and I'm hoping that the dot can come out and give it a little bit of 10 to 11 care to prevent any damage to the resident of cities vehicles.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9913.197s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9914.378s">I</a> think it's just important to point out that these large scale nonprofits like healthcare institutions and universities also provide a great community benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9923.132s">namely</a> jobs that provide a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9926.254s">So</a> we have to also take into consideration the economic benefits that they bring to a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9930.635s">You</a> see communities that have universities located inside them and the benefits that they have economically when the recession hits. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9937.858s">So</a> I think it's also important to point out the benefits that come along with having large-scale universities and large-scale healthcare institutions in the community that are non-profit as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10227.02s">Point</a> of information, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10230.303s">I</a> do believe the city and Tufts University have an agreement where all new purchases of parcels outside the campus, the existing campus, would be put on the tax rolls.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10407.334s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10409.87s">I'd</a> be remiss if we didn't recognize our colleague, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10413.713s">It</a> was Councilor Caraviello's resolution under the Burke administration that got us involved in the opioid lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10420.397s">And</a> without his foresight and vision, we wouldn't be here today receiving these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10425.141s">So</a> I'd like to thank him for taking the opportunity to be invested in the war on recovery here in our city and the steps that he took to make sure that we received these funds.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10719.095s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-10-05_7G1mRGUN6Dk/2024-10-05_7G1mRGUN6Dk.html">City Council 02-14-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=403.425s">Thank</a> you very much on these three firefighters bring a wealth of experience to the field, and I think that other city methods a safer place by having them being elevated to these positions of leadership so I'd like to congratulate them all and wish them a very successful and safe future to them and their families.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=665.054s">I</a> for one feels this is a good expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=667.055s">I</a> mean, I mean a good, a good initiative and a good endeavor because we look at the way that city's been spending money, lack of financial transparency anytime that we can set up a revolving fund or a trust fund to be sure that that money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent I think would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=681.466s">So,</a> by approving this we're actually providing an additional check and balance and additional control on the frivolous and wasteful spending that we're seeing that's coming out of the administration and the lack of transparency that was coming out of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=692.153s">So</a> by approving this, we're going to be creating another layer of oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=694.86s">I</a> think that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=695.742s">So</a> I'd move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=698.652s">and</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=861.045s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=861.866s">No,</a> thank you for sticking around to hear a couple of these resolutions that are on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=867.272s">Ultimately,</a> the condition of our roadways in the city of deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=871.257s">I</a> think you know what I think we all know, right, you could drive in front of Bob's food store for the past five years, and the bottle hasn't been <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=879.466s">patched</a> even, never mind a plan to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=882.75s">You'll</a> drive around the Winthrop Street Rotary going down High Street and you'll cross over the first pedestrian crosswalk there and ever since the first Eversource project, the <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=894.612s">Crosswalk</a> has been sunken in for now eight, nine years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=898.835s">I</a> know our DPW, I know our commissioner, I know our mayor drives down these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=902.557s">So</a> I know that they know the condition of these roadways is terrible, but we need to develop some sort of plan, some sort of methodology for how we're gonna attack this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=912.704s">We</a> have C-Click fix and we have 50 DPW members. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=915.706s">I</a> don't see why we can't take them all one day and say, get on the roads, drive down our emergency arteries and document each pothole that's on there and then we can put a plan together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=923.051s">on</a> how do we can patch these emergency arteries saving ultimately these the roads that our emergency vehicles drive down or EMS vehicles drive down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=928.392s">You</a> know, when there's a snow emergency, these are the vehicles that we're not allowed to park on, because these streets are used for public safety purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=935.194s">So</a> I think that it's something that we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=937.295s">And</a> I'm hoping that through the leadership of your office, you'll be able to come up with a plan on how we can address that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=993.154s">I</a> have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=994.535s">Golden</a> Ave has been a topic of discussion now for going in the better part of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1000.638s">We</a> appropriated some money to have the underground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired and then also have the above ground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1008.482s">And</a> I think that was supposed to take place over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1011.544s">Do</a> you have any idea what's going on with that project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1304.156s">One</a> thing I want to talk about in the past I've spoken about with Tim when he was the city engineer was, you know, some sort of mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1313.526s">When</a> these public utilities come to our community and dig up our streets and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1318.211s">expect</a> to leave their supplies their equipment, their stock on public ways or on public passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1326.643s">So</a> that's one way I think that we can look at this right if they want to leave the ticket stuff and get it out of here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1349.168s">So</a> I think that that's something that if we look at strengthening those mitigation agreements, I think that might be able to be a way that we can expand that patch on the roadway to maybe go a little bit further than a foot.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1380.237s">We</a> could post it on the website?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1384.844s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1385.285s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1385.986s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2136.144s">Madam</a> President, I just think it's important to point out that every action has a reaction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2141.989s">And</a> this whole process could be avoided if the mayor would just work with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2150.655s">We</a> wouldn't have to go through the process of creating legislation to direct the mayor to be transparent if she would work with the council and be a partner to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2159.881s">So,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2162.369s">Imagine</a> that we've gotten to the point where the council now has to rise to take legislative action to get the man to communicate us to communicate with us effectively when it comes down to the finances of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2173.814s">I</a> mean, I think that's where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2176.555s">That's</a> how far this relationship is deteriorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2179.396s">Now,</a> I've been in the city my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2182.037s">You</a> know, we've all heard the stories about what the council used to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2185.704s">when</a> there was fighting and screaming and yelling across the pit, everybody couldn't get along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2190.668s">We</a> get along relatively well here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2192.889s">This</a> is probably the first time in 40 years that the council actually walks in unison on a lot of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2199.954s">More</a> often than not, we're in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2202.016s">And</a> the one thing that we all agree on quite frequently is the lack of financial transparency in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2208.721s">So</a> I just think it's important to point out that the reason why the council has taken these steps <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2215.022s">is</a> because the council isn't being provided with the tools or the opportunity to be successful in their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2220.725s">So</a> we need to pass ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2222.526s">We</a> need to make laws telling the mayor to communicate with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2226.568s">Think</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2227.308s">How</a> outrageous that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2228.349s">That's</a> where we've, that's what we've come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2231.17s">And</a> that's where the relationship has deteriorated to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2234.052s">That's</a> the level of respect that the coroner's office gives this body that's been elected by the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2239.795s">So</a> I thank Councilor Bears for taking a proactive approach.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2810.103s">Can</a> I just repeat that I missed that but you said it's going to put off the use of body one police cameras.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2961.739s">You're</a> welcome to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2963.76s">The</a> way I look at this matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2968.382s">No,</a> I would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2969.763s">Because</a> right now I think that what we have in front of us is an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2974.646s">This</a> is craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2975.526s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2975.726s">This</a> isn't even something that's really important to the operation of our local government, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2979.528s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2980.349s">We</a> spent a lot of time, energy and effort working on something when I think we could have really been working on something else that matters to more people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2986.692s">I</a> understand that there's a group of people that care about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2988.893s">I'm</a> not really one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2991.174s">I</a> don't think that this is something that's vital to the future of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2995.835s">Quite</a> frankly, I think that it does things that can kind of hamstrung our ability to move forward and to promote a vision that adopts technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3004.018s">When</a> we sit down, when we first started talking about this ordinance, chat GPT wasn't a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3008.959s">And</a> now look what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3010.38s">So</a> in a very short period of time, technology has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3013.782s">And</a> quite frankly, when we codify something in an ordinance, the government process is designed to move slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3019.245s">And</a> by codifying this in ordinance, I think what it's going to do is hamstring us in our ability to adapt the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3025.768s">So</a> it's really not something that I want to support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3028.97s">You</a> know, I think when we're looking at the direction that we're going in here in the community, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3036.204s">We're</a> working on a lot of things, but the results that the people want to see that I talk to are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3046.627s">They're</a> on the ground, they're on the sidewalks, they're in the delivery of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3051.388s">So</a> while I can appreciate the work that's gone into this, it's not gonna be able to support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3055.209s">And</a> I asked my council colleagues to really think long and hard about an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments on the floor, and whether or not that's a good transparent public process for us to take hold of and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3067.511s">I</a> understand that the gentleman put a lot of work into it, as well as the lady, my colleague said I did an excellent job on this ordinance, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3072.792s">It's</a> just something that I have problems with, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3077.109s">theoretically.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3078.53s">So</a> for those reasons, I will be supporting the paper this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3563.783s">Madam</a> Mayor, I think we all know where we stand on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3565.224s">Why</a> don't we just take a vote?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6331.889s">I'm</a> looking at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6333.509s">I</a> have a question as to how it would work relative to the students in the dormitories
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6348.745s">You</a> know, so students in the dorm, they say you gotta go, school's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6352.509s">Yeah,</a> I don't wanna go, I wanna stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6354.31s">I</a> wanna stay for the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6356.131s">We</a> gotta give you notice, you gotta take it through the eviction process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6359.014s">I</a> mean, I'm not sure, I'm trying to figure out how that would apply.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6363.617s">To</a> the university.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6365.359s">Or</a> off campus housing in the university for that matter, you know what I mean?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6371.381s">I</a> just don't know who to place a burden on the university. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6373.349s">I</a> mean ultimately they house thousands of kids up there, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6412.57s">Right,</a> but what it does do is it creates a punitive situation for where if the property owner fails to provide the certain notice, they're going to be fined $300 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6419.417s">So</a> if we have a property on a Tufts University that has 900 kids in housing, and they fail to comply, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6428.273s">900</a> times 300 times 300 times every day at the fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6431.98s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6432.782s">They're</a> one of our bodies in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6434.144s">We</a> don't want to put an administrative burden on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6435.687s">It's</a> going to be punitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6440.373s">I</a> support the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6441.093s">I</a> just, I think the fines excessive really is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6443.014s">I</a> mean, if it was 25 bucks or something like that, yeah, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6445.354s">300</a> bucks for not sending somebody a notice about what their rights are when they get evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6448.555s">When,</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6449.435s">We</a> have all heard the term caveat emptied by everywhere, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6452.776s">You</a> also have to be able to have some accountability personally and know what your rights are as well, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6457.837s">It's</a> not government's job to hold everybody's hand all the time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6460.458s">Some</a> people have to have some certain personal accountability, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6463.619s">So</a> if you run into a situation where you're gonna be evicted, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6466.359s">You</a> might wanna say, hey, what are my rights? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6467.8s">Cause</a> I'm being evicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6470.615s">and</a> have some personal accountability as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6472.617s">I</a> just think that the $300 fine is very excessive, especially because it's for every day that passes, it's another $300, and it constitutes another violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6480.523s">If</a> we brought that down to, you know, 25 bucks or 50 bucks, I would have a problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6576.61s">That</a> discretion part is what makes me curious, especially after listening to what Mr. Harris had to say a few minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6584.082s">What's</a> good for the goose should be good for the gander. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6585.643s">It</a> shouldn't be at discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6586.564s">If</a> it's violation, it's a violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6587.804s">If</a> it's not, it's not, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6589.566s">I</a> mean, ultimately what we're doing is putting language in here to say that the board of health director can haphazardly policy if they see fit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6596.07s">And</a> fine up to $300, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6597.371s">I</a> don't think that's what we're looking to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6599.212s">I</a> don't think that's what the goal objective is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6603.363s">So</a> ultimately, we're saying the Board of Health Director may at their discretion do this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6607.808s">So</a> ultimately, we're talking about issues of equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6609.83s">We're</a> talking about government not being trusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6612.052s">We're</a> talking about putting controls in on government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=6614.915s">But</a> then we're going to give somebody the authority to act haphazard and apply policy unevenly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7021.325s">Just,</a> Madam President, if it's about transparency, right, and it's about making sure that people are aware of something, then why are we attaching a punitive measure to it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7028.968s">Why</a> are we attaching a fine at the end of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7032.022s">if</a> it's about transparency and it's about making sure that people have knowledge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7035.585s">I</a> mean, this is always an excuse when it comes up to something, this is some reason why the people aren't competent enough to pursue what it is they need to pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7041.871s">There's</a> always a reason we're trying to pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7043.592s">What</a> about the person that doesn't have internet? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7044.974s">Yeah,</a> that one person, like, come on, it's 2023, the internet is everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7048.997s">They're</a> giving phones away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7051.339s">You</a> walk into the store, they're giving you a phone for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7053.64s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7054.08s">Come</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7054.461s">Everybody</a> has access to the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7055.761s">If</a> not, there's plenty of places to access the internet, number one, number two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7058.603s">You</a> know, I don't think that we give the general populace enough credit sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7063.827s">All</a> right, we don't give the general populace enough credit sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7067.529s">But</a> with that being said, I'd motion to strike the fine from $300 to $50, and then I'll move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7088.51s">Well,</a> I'm going to, I mean, I'm making the motion to make it 50 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7091.433s">And</a> then if it passes, I'll move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7161.292s">I</a> mean, ultimately what we're doing is we're asking the landlord to give a piece of paper that the city puts together to the tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7166.793s">We're</a> gonna charge them 300 bucks if they don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7168.634s">That's</a> a little much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7169.854s">That's</a> a little crazy, but I support the, I appreciate the council's second on the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7211.305s">One</a> more moment of motion to exempt Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7215.227s">Motion</a> to accept Tufts University on campus housing University.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7223.839s">Under</a> B-5, I guess it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=7225.92s">4933-B-5,</a> new section.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_plgT6PVUdo0/2024-10-05_plgT6PVUdo0.html">City Council 01-31-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=40.933s">Madam</a> President, I offer a motion this evening as I look out in the audience and I see a number of our friends from organized labor that are here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=47.219s">Normally</a> they have been able to provide us with updates throughout the course of this past term. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=51.917s">as</a> to the status of the contract negotiations and the status of labor relations here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=56.318s">And</a> they've always very patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=58.578s">They</a> usually wait till the end of the meeting, sometimes three and four hours after the opportunity to speak before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=63.259s">So</a> I thought it'd be a nice gesture to allow them to speak first this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1726.31s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1727.432s">So</a> thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1729.735s">And</a> once again, providing us with such a detailed outline as to the status of the negotiations for the <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1735.906s">200</a> plus families that you represent here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1739.449s">Um,</a> recently it was brought to my attention that there's a certain issue with new hires and their ability to access health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1745.293s">Um,</a> you know, it's, I have a little bit of a background in the union as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1747.855s">And</a> it's my understanding that, uh, here in the city of Medford, the municipal employee is required to offer health insurance to their employees.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1765.017s">She</a> used to have to fill out this affidavit and submit it to mayor Burke in order to get her group health insurance that she was receiving from the city when she was a city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1773.994s">and</a> she had to file an affidavit that said I work 22 hours a week and that made her eligible for the health insurance that she received through the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1780.276s">So</a> I was looking at this and I'm not understanding why exactly a new hire now in this community that would come in that's working 37 and a half hours a week wouldn't be afforded the same group health insurance benefits that every other employee here in the community is being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1794.422s">Is</a> there an understanding as to what's going on with the application of this benefit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1852.688s">haven't</a> worked in insurance and haven't some experience in insurance it seems to me like the open enrollment period especially for employees in the GIC is usually what sometime around June or July is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1863.594s">About</a> then, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1865.395s">So</a> what what they're saying is that if an employee that started now in January wouldn't be able to access health insurance while being a city employee for up to 11 months
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1931.946s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Seltz. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1932.647s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1934.85s">You</a> know, what I see, Mr. Seltz, to be honest with you, is a trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1937.794s">It's</a> a pattern, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1939.179s">And</a> I think it has less and less to do with good government here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1943.021s">It</a> has less and less to do with doing what's right for the workers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1947.324s">And</a> there's more to do with a vendetta, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1950.346s">Someone</a> that's vindictive, someone that's upset because you're speaking out, someone that's upset because you're expressing the concerns that your membership has and doing your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1961.372s">And</a> it might be putting some <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1963.579s">some</a> rust on the can of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1965.64s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1965.94s">So</a> the way I look at this is I see a lot of it is retaliatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1968.822s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1970.163s">I</a> see no reason for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1972.324s">I</a> don't understand why the cost of living adjustment for one group would be more so than the cost of living adjustment for another group when the cost of living is really a reflection on inflation and how far you can stretch it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1985.07s">And</a> ultimately, we want to keep, you know, the rank and file employees in this community working. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1989.637s">They're</a> a hard working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1990.718s">You</a> know, I've had the opportunity to know many of these people for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1995.004s">And,</a> you know, when <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=1999.215s">You</a> pick up the phone and you call, they always answer, they always deliver, they're always there. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2003.899s">And</a> like Councilor Scarpelli said, your group prides itself on showing up for work every day and doing its job, regardless of what the climate is here on City Hall, regardless of what's going on between the administration and the union, they come to work every day and they do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2017.97s">And</a> that should be reflected in this wage package as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2020.452s">I'm</a> very grateful for the work that your employees do, that your members do, and that these employees do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2025.376s">I</a> thank you again for coming up here and sharing with us your experience.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2443.022s">And</a> pursuant to a city charter, if I'm not mistaken, the mayor is the chief negotiator for the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2449.068s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2450.369s">The</a> mayor is the chief negotiator, so ultimately we have five bargaining units with unsettled contracts and the chief negotiator refusing to meet with these five unions and instead sending an underling. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=2461.098s">It's</a> paid for outside the scope of city employment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3262.943s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3264.464s">Michael</a> Callahan was a dear friend of mine, someone who <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3268.323s">represented</a> the city of Medford and its people with great pride and dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3272.744s">He</a> was a Vietnam War veteran, the founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission and past commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3279.926s">He</a> was the aide to the late Senator John Bullock, an aide to the late Senator Dennis McKenna, the former assistant commissioner of racing and chief steward for the National Association of Government Employees, just to name a few roles that he helped, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3296.77s">Michael</a> Callahan was also <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3298.69s">elected</a> our governor's Councilor, and he served with dignity representing the people of this community for over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3306.394s">Michael</a> passed away on the last day of his term in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3310.096s">He</a> was never able to <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3311.914s">reap</a> the benefits of his pension reward. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3316.6s">But</a> he was someone who has some fame here in the city of Medford for saving Wrights Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3322.147s">And</a> if you go up to Wrights Pond now, you will see a memorial honoring Michael Callahan that Mayor McGlynn put in to recognize the work that he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3330.958s">back</a> in the late 80s when Medford was undergoing quite a development boom and the condos were being built around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3339.061s">There</a> was a proposal to turn Wrights Pond into residential housing and Michael Callahan was the catalyst in organizing the neighborhood against this proposal and saving Wrights Pond and keeping it as the beautiful recreation destination that it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3354.167s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3356.576s">with</a> his vision and foresight, Wrights Pond is now probably one of the city's number one assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3361.76s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to take a moment to honor my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3365.102s">This</a> is something that I've put on every year since Michael's passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3368.825s">He's</a> someone that really cared about the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3371.767s">We</a> talk about having blue and white debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3373.508s">We</a> talk about people that step up to the plate and really put their money where their mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3378.412s">And</a> Mike Callahan was that guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3380.307s">When</a> he ran for State Senate back in 2005, his logo was, he helps people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3385.291s">And</a> there was no more truthful saying than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3389.214s">My</a> county, I woke up every day to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3391.236s">And</a> he took great pride in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3393.478s">And</a> he always said to me, you could measure your wealth in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3397.221s">You</a> could measure it monetarily, or you could measure your wealth in the number of lives that you touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3401.665s">And</a> Michael is just a great individual who touched many lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3404.427s">And</a> he was the wealthiest man.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3438.093s">It's</a> not so often that someone gets to reach the great age of 80 years old, an octogenarian, I believe they're called, Madam President, but John Grenard is someone who is very familiar to all of us who are involved in public life here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3453.747s">John</a> was a former member of the Medford School Committee, a former member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3459.852s">John</a> served as the special sheriff <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3463.904s">to</a> Middlesex County under Sheriff DePaola. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3467.829s">He</a> has a very, very, very prestigious record <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3471.349s">of</a> public service here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3473.489s">One</a> of the most brilliant men I've ever met in my life when it comes to political analysis and the ability to look at an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3480.991s">Also</a> a great volunteer of his time, service, energy to many neighborhood and community groups here in the city, most notably the Medford Elks, for example, and the American Legion Post 45, where he'd perform countless hours of pro bono legal work for them and making sure that their assets were protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3500.395s">John's</a> been a great friend to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3502.917s">He's</a> someone who I admire greatly and I'm glad to see that he had the opportunity to celebrate his 80th birthday surrounded by his friends and family. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3511.661s">And</a> I want to take an opportunity just to extend a happy birthday to him and to let him know that he means a lot to the city of Medford still. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3519.665s">And</a> I ask my council colleagues to join me in this celebration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3581.701s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3583.997s">When</a> I first got out of college, I had the opportunity to work underneath Senate President Thomas Birmingham in the Massachusetts State Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3591.303s">And</a> he was certainly a brilliant man, a great leader, former candidate for governor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3596.868s">And</a> I had a great opportunity to work on his gubernatorial campaign where I got to spend a significant amount of time with him and I learned about what a great person he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3606.778s">raised</a> in the community of Chelsea, representing Revere Charlestown and Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3611.503s">Thomas</a> Birmingham was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate after defeating, I believe, Reggie Volk. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3616.829s">And</a> he served in the State Senate admirably, rising to the rank of Senate President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3621.915s">Most</a> notably, he is remembered for the Education Reform Act of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3626.5s">And</a> the Educational Reform Act of 1992 established the standardized testing, standardized measurements of public schools so that we'd be able to identify and compare apples to apples data between school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3637.809s">It</a> also enacted what's known as the School Building Assistance Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3641.753s">And</a> the School Building Assistance Program was something that we here in the city of Metric were able to utilize 23 years ago for the construction of other schools in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3649.839s">So</a> when you talk about Thomas Birmingham, you talk about a gentleman who was surrounded by great help <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3654.953s">And</a> when you talk about some of the great help that he was surrounded by, you have to mention on real world. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3660.004s">Who</a> serves here on our community development board, we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3664.531s">I'm</a> sorry, CBA now, yes, yes, multiple hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3667.972s">We</a> talk about James Francis Xavier Walsh from High Street who worked under the Birmingham campaign and worked under Tom in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3677.555s">He</a> was a great mentor and cultivator of great talent and a great individual that really cared about his community in this state and he accomplished a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3686.137s">It</a> would be sad to miss, so I ask my council colleagues to join me in honoring him and extending deepest condolences to Selma and the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3812.122s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3813.382s">And</a> Councilor Capello, thanks for putting this item on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3816.383s">I've</a> known Tom for probably 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3818.784s">His</a> nephews, Matt and Joe, I know very well as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3822.306s">And</a> this is the first time I ever heard that story. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3825.437s">about</a> the Friday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3826.237s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3827.177s">Um,</a> Tom is a great person, a great friend and like Councilor Caraviello said, he was a gentleman, a true gentleman, someone that, um, was bigger than life, but, uh, very quiet, very quiet gentleman, uh, someone that when he spoke, uh, it was with a purpose and, uh, it was usually, uh, to give you the right piece of advice to say the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3847.421s">It'll</a> be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3848.241s">And</a> I thank the council for putting this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=3876.826s">I'd</a> like to ask that the records be laid on the table, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4424.072s">By</a> way of history, normally what the consul would do is we'd put a restriction on the special permit or a condition on the special permit that would say that the special permit is attached to the business entity and not the address on the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4435.715s">So</a> that if that business entity moved on, the permit would move on with the business entity and die. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4441.996s">It</a> would have to go back through the application process again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4450.236s">That's</a> just explain what I think Councilor Scarpelli was getting at history. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=4454.957s">That's</a> the way we've normally done it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5012.917s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5014.317s">Um,</a> ultimately, I think it's safe to say right that this isn't a project that any of this behind the rail were crazy about from the start, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5022.262s">Um,</a> that's why we went to court. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5024.243s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5025.223s">Um,</a> our recourse is very limited legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5028.105s">You</a> know, that's why the judge remanded the case back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5032.187s">Um,</a> ultimately, what we're being asked to do is approve a storage tank, a flammable gas, flammable liquid storage tank, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5040.692s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5041.612s">It's</a> a by right, it's a by right application. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5046.317s">It</a> just requires a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5048.64s">Virtually</a> every city board that had this application before we received it, signed off on it in one way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5058.592s">So</a> our request was very limited from the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5063.053s">So</a> when we look at this, the only body here in the community that said no was the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5069.055s">Every</a> other body negotiated some sort of condition or restriction or compromise solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5077.258s">And</a> the council dug its heels and it said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5079.499s">And</a> we lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5081.296s">Okay,</a> so now we're in the position where, although it's not necessarily a project that many of us were crazy about, it's the project that by right can be there and it's the project that by right we're going to get, in my opinion, after we take this vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5096.536s">I</a> think that BJ's has come up and they've, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5099.842s">done</a> a mea culpa on some of the bad neighbor issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5103.783s">They've</a> certainly been very forthright in their willingness to add additional conditions and restrictions and requirements that we're looking for to make us a little bit happier with the proposed use and the impacts and effects that it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5121.829s">So</a> with that being said, I think that the process has been a long and arduous one, and I'm glad that at the end of the day, we can come to some sort of agreement that protects both parties' interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=5133.377s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper this evening, and I hope we can move for a vote, for a favorable vote in short order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6261.453s">Is</a> it safe to say, sir, that based upon the amount of questions that you have relative to the project, that you'd be opposed to this project at this point in time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6268.434s">Based</a> upon the amount of questions that you're asking this evening surrounding the project and how it's going to work, it seems like you're opposed to the project at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6547.494s">Ultimately,</a> the way this works is because of <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6550.237s">the</a> zoning in the area where the gas station is going to be located. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6554.758s">They</a> have the right to do this by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6556.558s">All</a> they're doing is coming to us for a special permit so that we can put conditions on it to protect the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6562.06s">And</a> I think we've accomplished that. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6564.06s">But</a> ultimately, we went to court on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6565.541s">We</a> said we don't want the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6566.801s">We</a> lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6567.661s">That's</a> why they sent it back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6569.301s">So</a> now here we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6570.202s">What</a> are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6570.862s">We're</a> going to go and say, sorry, judge, we don't want to negotiate anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6575.043s">And</a> then they send it back to the judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6576.483s">The</a> judge says, OK, Medford, you lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6578.023s">And</a> then all the restrictions go out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6580.624s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6581.044s">Because</a> that's the alternative at this point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6726.057s">I</a> think this brings us right back to the beginning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6729.338s">That's</a> why we voted no the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6730.739s">That's</a> why we got sued. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6732.359s">Because</a> we said BJ should be better neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6734.16s">And</a> that brought us to where we are today with all these conditions and restrictions that we have on the permit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6742.964s">So,</a> I mean, what we did was we did exactly what you're asking, what you asked us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6746.706s">We</a> just did it a long time ago and we lost in court.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6900.892s">Anyone</a> else who was just to that point, and I thank the gentleman for putting the words in my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6906.477s">But</a> ultimately, why would I legal counsel agree to bring it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6910.741s">If</a> we had such a strong case? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6912.763s">All</a> right, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6915.865s">makes</a> no sense to me, obviously, because we weren't negotiating from position of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6920.149s">And</a> now we had the opportunity to negotiate a stronger agreement than we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=6923.432s">We</a> were going in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7515.431s">Madam</a> President, I do think it's important to point out that Attorney Austin said that <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7519.554s">The</a> labor practices of Starbucks is not a significant or appropriate reason for the denial of the special permit and the conditions to the extent that I was. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7529.44s">I</a> for one feel as though Starbucks is not a very good employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7532.862s">I</a> feel as though they've gone a little bit too far in their efforts to impede with labor organizing in their corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7544.833s">I</a> think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7546.314s">However,</a> based upon the slap that we just got relative to BJ's after a year long of legal haranguing, I do feel as though it would be the city's best interest financially to approve the document that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7558.259s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7904.364s">I</a> think it's important to point out this doesn't just apply to municipal buildings as well as private residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7909.247s">Right,</a> this would be all just municipal construction, it's all new construction.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=7941.128s">I</a> don't, but you know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9005.21s">Just</a> point of information, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9007.771s">I</a> also don't think it's a good idea for the city of Medford to start getting into the transportation business now. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9013.114s">We</a> can't even forget shopping pencils in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9015.456s">We're</a> gonna start freaking running buses all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9017.637s">I</a> mean, let's be honest here. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9019.298s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9019.798s">We</a> got a parking department that we just opened up in a year, and it's been nothing but a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9022.92s">If</a> we take over a transit department, who the hell knows what's gonna happen.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9727.965s">Councilmember</a> bears brings up a good point and it really never was a practice is something that I experienced previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9736.504s">where</a> when you don't fill out the census, you get removed from the voter rolls, and it's created some significant level of confusion across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9744.345s">In</a> my historic involvement in the city, up until we hired an election coordinator, we really never removed anybody from the rolls if they didn't participate in the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9754.787s">So</a> you get into a situation where someone gets removed from the voter rolls for not filling out the census, now they become an uninformed voter, because now they're not on the voter rolls, so they don't get mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9764.615s">They</a> don't get mail, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9765.736s">So</a> they get mail from no candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9767.157s">So</a> they become an uninformed voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9768.918s">So</a> now you have an uninformed voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9770.218s">That's</a> me, for example, I haven't missed an election since I was 18 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9773.961s">I</a> didn't fill up the census this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9775.862s">I</a> went to go last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9777.182s">I</a> went to go vote and I wasn't allowed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9779.944s">I</a> was on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9784.327s">My</a> name was on the ballot, but I wasn't allowed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9788.067s">It's</a> a bad practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9788.968s">You</a> know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9789.408s">Because</a> that person that goes into the voter booth to vote and they get told that they can't or that they're not on the list or that they're inactive is going to turn around and walk out the door and there's a chance they might not come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9798.853s">So</a> now we have someone that's become an uninformed voter because they're not getting any mail from the candidates because they're not showing up on the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9805.452s">And</a> then when they go to vote, it's actually an impediment for them to cast in their ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9809.755s">So</a> I think the practice needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9812.396s">And</a> again, it was never an issue up until we created this election coordinators position. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9816.819s">And</a> now we have an election manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9818.778s">But</a> I think it's a practice that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9820.399s">It's</a> a policy that needs to be reviewed because, you know, everybody talks about wanting to drive more people out to the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9826.08s">How</a> do we get more people out to the polls? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9827.441s">We</a> don't have election day anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9828.661s">We</a> get like election month for cry-eye, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9830.461s">You</a> can mail it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9831.202s">You</a> can come in from, you know, pretty soon we're going to be able to vote through our television or do it on the internet, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9836.363s">and</a> it's going to be able to be something you can vote for whoever you want, whatever you want for this month, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9841.645s">So,</a> you know, the way that we're expanding access to voting, it doesn't make sense to me to take people off the rolls for not filling out the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9848.427s">You</a> know, I think that there's a better practice or a better way that we can look at it, especially if you look at the vote history of an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9853.429s">I</a> mean, you're going to see someone that voted in 15 municipal elections in a row or 20 elections in a row and you're taking them off the rolls, but you know, they lived there, they paid the tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9862.332s">You</a> know, it's just something that I find very confusing when you can't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9865.353s">the</a> way the system set up, you can't register to vote in two communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9867.715s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9868.336s">You're</a> going to get caught because so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9870.498s">It's</a> just, I don't think it's a great practice that's conducive to promoting participation in elections.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=9912.42s">I'm</a> still blaming you for kicking everybody off the road four years ago.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10325.31s">I</a> know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10325.91s">It's</a> because we complain that we call them up here so many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10328.931s">So</a> the administration said, you're making us look bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10330.751s">Could</a> you put something down and see how long it's going to last just to get the noise to go away?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10335.853s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10336.493s">That's</a> why.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10858.83s">Thank</a> you, you know on the appointment of President Tom I recall when we went through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10864.652s">I</a> believe, I think, Rick and I were the only two that were on the council at the time, yeah man McGlynn was the mayor, and what man McGlynn did was he had a huge fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10875.234s">And</a> at this fundraiser, they raised a ton of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10878.197s">for</a> private donors to create a maintenance and upkeep fund that would maintain the upkeep of the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10886.685s">Then</a> the fountain COVID came the phone has been shut off for at least three years right at least three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10891.53s">Yes,</a> at least three years, but there's a dedicated account here in City Hall and Councilor Caraviello is on point with this we need to find out what balance is left in that account because <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10902.26s">based</a> upon the financial spending habits that I'm seeing with this administration, the lack of financial and fiscal transparency and responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10909.185s">I'm</a> thinking to myself that we're in a very significant fiscal crisis here in this community, because they're not sharing any financial documents with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10915.97s">They're</a> not showing us the Warren articles where the money is getting spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10918.811s">They're</a> not providing us with the quarterly updates that we're asking for and what the status of our financial picture is here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10924.195s">So</a> it's leading me to believe that these accounts that are sitting around for a little bit of time that had a dedicated and committed purpose that people have forgotten about are going to be getting graded soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/plgT6PVUdo0&t=10932.497s">So</a> I'd like to see that.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_afyYb4sUUnA/2024-10-05_afyYb4sUUnA.html">City Council 01-17-23</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3776.756s">Is</a> there an email address, maybe a general email address, a customer service email address, or something like that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3802.07s">You</a> sound like that Nigerian Prince I get the emails from today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3983.659s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3985.16s">Thank</a> you to the team from BJS for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3989.322s">This</a> has been quite a long dance for all of us, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=3991.904s">And</a> at the end of the day, looking at what's before us here and the proposals that have been made and the concessions that have been made, the mitigation efforts that have been made, can you just give me <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4003.985s">the</a> ballpark cost as to how much all these extras for mitigation are going to cost PJs at this point?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4028.223s">I</a> just think it's important to show that you're making an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4031.784s">When</a> you think about DJs, this is your first store, your landmark store. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4038.128s">We</a> talked about the history of the issues that we've had there, but ultimately you're a large employer here in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4043.41s">You</a> know, I think you bring a lot of good to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4045.531s">And,</a> you know, these quality of life issues are going to come with any big business that's located in an area that abuts a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4054.655s">But</a> it's important, I think, to point out the fact that you put money where your mouth is when you're investing in the neighborhood and investing in the community through the proposal that you made for us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4063.738s">One</a> thing I do have concern about would be an application for extended hours for operation of the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4068.92s">Um,</a> that's something that I don't think the neighbors would particularly care for. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4072.362s">Um,</a> that's something that I think that, you know, we'd have to address, you know, going going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4077.285s">If</a> you came forward with that application, I don't want to end up in a situation that we're in right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4091.734s">Yeah,</a> so we're not looking to have anything right because I just don't want to see us doing this again where you know the neighbors don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4096.816s">We</a> get to this long Toronto Priya fight about you know what's going to happen for a couple hours.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4107.661s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4107.941s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=4108.481s">I</a> appreciate you guys taking the time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5223.443s">Also,</a> Madam President, if I may, by way of the rules, isn't there a seven-day waiting period, six-day waiting period to allow for comments from individuals that may not have participated in the public hearing but wanted to exercise their opinion in writing?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5421.22s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5422.621s">I</a> also think it's very important to point out what exactly <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5426.22s">It</a> is that we're being asked to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5429.782s">Ultimately,</a> we're being asked to vote on a permit for an underground storage tank. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5438.047s">That's</a> a special permit that's allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5442.309s">All</a> right, it's allowed by right, but requires a special permit for use. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5446.551s">So</a> when we talk about this proposal and the fact that it's been vetted and revetted, you know, both locally and legally, ultimately this matter wasn't remanded back to the city council for a public hearing because our rationale was on strong legal footing. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5463.958s">And</a> I think the applicant also recognizes that the history <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5469.495s">between</a> the city, the neighborhood, and the applicant's business hasn't been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5477.28s">But</a> they've put a foot forward and made an effort both, I'd say, financially and physically to improve some of the quality of life issues in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5491.91s">And</a> I think that's a positive sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5493.731s">And</a> I think that's a step in the right direction because ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5497.55s">If</a> we look backwards at everything that's gone wrong, then we're never going to be able to make progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5504.257s">And</a> I think it's pretty clear that when we did that during the initial public hearing, it wasn't the rational basis for a denial or the paper wouldn't have been sent back to us for this proceeding this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5517.845s">I'd</a> certainly like to hear additional feedback from the neighborhood, from the residents during the six day waiting period before I make a commitment as to which way I'm going to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5528.431s">But</a> I do want to recognize the efforts that the applicant has put forward in trying to rebuild this relationship and also investing in our community and addressing some of the things that are important to us that will mitigate and offset some of the impacts of the gas station should this underground storage permit be authorized.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5550.878s">It's</a> practice anyway, I believe, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5553.779s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=5554.26s">By</a> rule rather, so yes, I would not make a motion to waive it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6559.927s">well-publicized</a> labor dispute with its employee organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6564.49s">And</a> the reason that this paper was tabled was because we wanted to allow Starbucks the opportunity to right the wrongs that have been going on with their anti-union campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6575.658s">So</a> it's my understanding that this anti-union campaign still prevails. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6581.302s">And</a> I'm certainly not opposed to giving this ample consideration, but I'm not going to give a consideration <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6586.974s">at</a> a point in time where the workers feel as though they're being mistreated, and they feel as though their ability to organize is being impeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6593.999s">So</a> with that being said, this is certainly something that I have an open mind to, but right now I don't feel as though the temperature is right for this council to make a vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=6601.845s">So</a> I'd ask the applicant to withdraw or refile when the labor situation gets resolved.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=7618.869s">I</a> do think it's also very important to point out that the City of Medford has maintenance and upkeep agreements with the DCI for a number of DCI-owned and controlled properties, Sleepy Hollow being one of those locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=7631.486s">So</a> it might be in our best interest to also take a look internally through our DPW commissioner to see if in fact this area is an area that has a maintenance and upkeep agreement with the DCR, because it might actually be the city's responsibility, not the DCR's to maintain this area due to the agreement that they had to do, I think back under the Romney administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8557.622s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8559.443s">Ultimately,</a> I don't think this is something that should be explored any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8562.904s">It's</a> pretty simple, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8564.364s">Either</a> we want NIPS in our community or we don't, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8566.965s">We</a> have no problem banning leaf blowers, but we can't ban NIPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8570.066s">I</a> mean, come on, let's be serious here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8576.168s">Not</a> yet, not yet, but if I was a betting man- And we never will. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8579.569s">If</a> I was a betting man, I'd say a few years down the line, it's just gonna come into effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8586.456s">But</a> anyway, the delayed implementation, they call it, I think, is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8592.439s">Effective</a> four years from now, they'll be banned. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8595.6s">If</a> I was a betting man, I'd say that's what's gonna happen.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8602.363s">But</a> I don't understand why we can't ban nips. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8605.204s">I</a> mean, ultimately, if we want them in our community, we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8607.545s">And</a> the argument that was made by the gentleman that owned the liquor store that <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8612.397s">People</a> with drinking problems use NIPS to regulate their consumption is, quite frankly, probably in contradiction and contrast to every single public health advisory that you could ever read when it comes down to somebody who's dealing with addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8625.981s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8626.861s">So</a> that argument, I don't think holds any water in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8630.542s">This</a> is something that's been laying around, just like many things that have been laying around when we send it across the hall to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8635.684s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8636.345s">So</a> the conversation should have been started a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8639.129s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8639.71s">We</a> jumped out of this conversation already. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8641.372s">We</a> asked for feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8642.634s">We</a> asked to get a response from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8644.317s">We</a> got nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8645.418s">Once</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8646.233s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8646.653s">Once</a> again, so we can either go down this road again, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8649.894s">Or</a> we can say that we're going to take affirmative steps and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8652.514s">Um,</a> you know, I, for one think that they should just be banned in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8656.295s">Um,</a> I'm not crazy about the 5 cent nickel, you know, return the bottle redemption on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8662.397s">Um,</a> because it's still going to leave us with the same problem that they're going to be everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8666.257s">And</a> then we're going to rely on somebody who wants to make a nickel to go around and pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8669.836s">It's</a> not going to be the city that's picking them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8671.496s">We're</a> still going to have the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8673.017s">We're</a> just going to try to create a revenue source to somebody who has the wherewithal and the work ethic to want to go around and pick them up and turn them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8680.118s">I</a> don't think that's the way that we should be handling this. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8682.159s">I</a> think that this is something that should be just blanket banned. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8685.279s">I</a> mean, it's a one ounce plastic bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8687.06s">It's</a> a single use bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8688.04s">We'd</a> be in single use bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8689.2s">We're</a> not going to be in a single use bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8690.94s">I</a> think it would make sense, but I will support the motion this evening, but this is something that I think should have been done already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8828.976s">Madam</a> President, I said this before, I see this as nothing more than <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8833.353s">campaign</a> tactic by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8835.535s">These</a> are papers that we do not have to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8837.636s">These</a> are papers that are financial in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8840.078s">We</a> still have not gotten the Warren articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8843.4s">All</a> right, we still haven't gotten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8845.041s">But</a> three weeks in a row now we've gotten papers saying this is how we're going to spend your APA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8849.624s">All</a> right, so something's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8851.765s">All</a> right, something smells rotten in Denmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8854.322s">I</a> don't know what it is, but something smells rotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8856.924s">It's</a> just not adding up, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8860.065s">It's</a> just not adding up. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8862.607s">I</a> don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8863.608s">Where</a> they're spending the money is such a secret, but then every week we can have somebody from the administration come and tell us where they're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, which this council has no oversight authority on. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8874.954s">I</a> really think it's nothing more than an effort to campaign from the rail because the mayor has an opponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8880.497s">Look</a> at all the good stuff I'm doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8881.798s">Look</a> at all the good stuff I'm doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8882.918s">For</a> three years, I wouldn't talk to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8885.6s">But</a> now, the kitchen's getting a little warm. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8889.233s">I</a> want to come out and show my face. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8890.814s">So</a> quite frankly, I think it's an exercise in futility, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8894.618s">Number</a> two, only a Councilor can put forward a measure that goes on the agenda, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8899.162s">Every</a> rule of resolution, every order of resolution has to be sponsored by a member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8902.945s">So</a> this is three weeks in a row the mayor's put money papers on. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8905.287s">We've</a> asked her for a financial plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8906.949s">We've</a> asked her to show us what's going on with the money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8910.051s">And</a> we haven't seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8911.312s">And</a> now we're getting fed piecemeal week after week, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8914.715s">Because</a> if you think back to the beginning of this fiscal year, how many supplemental appropriations have we been asked to make so far? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8919.999s">How</a> many jobs we've been asked to create? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8922.301s">None</a> of it fits into the financial plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8924.162s">None</a> of it fits into the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8926.304s">But</a> because we're being fed piecemeal, <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8929.933s">And</a> because we're not being provided with the documentation that we've requested now going on in an inordinate amount of time, years, we're unable to make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8938.84s">So</a> then we all sit up here looking like a bunch of goobers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8941.922s">Going</a> back and forth, not being able to make a decision because we all wanna do the right thing and we can't because we're not given the tools in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8948.747s">So</a> last June, when we sat here and the mayor said that we'd have an assistant city solicitor and the assistant city solicitor will be at our meeting and they should be sitting right here right now, but the job hasn't even been posted yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8960.74s">Who's</a> the sucker? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8961.761s">We</a> are, once again, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8963.421s">We</a> look like the big dummies in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8966.763s">We</a> look like the big dummies in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8968.124s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8969.205s">Enough's</a> enough with this administration and the spending and the lack of fiscal transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8974.047s">All</a> right, it's not fair to us, it's not fair to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8976.829s">Okay,</a> we're hired to do a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8979.39s">The</a> mayor sat here right next to me for a decade and she said, our number one job is to be fiscal watchdogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8985.547s">And</a> then she ran on a platform of unity, community, and transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8989.128s">I</a> haven't seen any community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8990.548s">I</a> haven't seen any unity with this body, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8993.188s">And</a> I haven't seen any transparency when it comes to the finances in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8996.709s">So</a> we're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8997.909s">What's</a> going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=8998.909s">What</a> is going on with that financial picture? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9001.25s">If</a> you look on the agenda, Madam President, you'll see a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9003.63s">And</a> it was a spending moratorium until the mayor complies. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9006.831s">And</a> we talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9007.611s">And</a> we said, let's give the mayor a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9009.451s">Let's</a> give the mayor an opportunity to come around. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9016.006s">the</a> sacrificial lamb, Mr. Dickinson up here a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9020.429s">And</a> he said, I don't even know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9022.611s">Warren</a> articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9023.271s">What</a> do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9023.952s">Warren</a> articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9024.712s">I</a> don't even know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9026.774s">The</a> administration, we've been talking about this now for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9030.076s">The</a> administration has never even said it to the finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9033.118s">The</a> left hand does not know what the right is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9035.16s">And</a> we can't keep spending money. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9036.821s">If</a> the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing, because this body right here certainly doesn't know what's going on because we haven't been provided the information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9043.252s">So</a> this is just another perfect example of spending for the purpose of press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9048.078s">So,</a> you know, when I look at these papers that come before the body, I look at the issues that are facing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9057.09s">Councilor</a> Tseng said it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9059.786s">government</a> by social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9061.127s">That's</a> what this is Medford talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9062.649s">There's</a> lots of tech talks about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9064.07s">So</a> now that's how we're going to make our decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9066.072s">That's</a> not how government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9068.154s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9068.354s">That's</a> not how government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9069.655s">Facebook,</a> Facebook, TikTok, social media, not real life, fake life, not real life, not real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9076.181s">So,</a> you know, I, I'm looking at this madam president and I'm scratching my head and I'm saying that's another half a million bucks that the city administration spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9084.272s">I</a> have no problem with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9085.474s">It's</a> a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9086.195s">I've</a> known about this project for well over a year because the executive director at the housing authority came to us over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9091.902s">And</a> he told us this is what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9094.526s">And</a> he said he was going to ask for the funds.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9104.292s">But</a> we knew about it, not because of the actions of the administration, because the act is the Director of the Housing Authority, the person who's looking for the money, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9111.536s">And</a> we still, again, have no idea what the financial picture is in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9314.697s">When</a> are we gonna get the information, the financial information that we've requested now going on about about a 24 months?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9357.354s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9358.114s">This</a> is nothing more than an end around than a lack of transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9361.055s">They're</a> hiding something. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9362.608s">Follow</a> the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9363.329s">Everybody</a> says follow the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/afyYb4sUUnA&t=9364.51s">We</a> can't follow the money because they're not showing us where it's going, which leads me to believe that they're hiding something.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_fxQMdebqk-Y/2024-11-19_fxQMdebqk-Y.html">City Council 12-20-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4365.883s">What</a> are we looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4366.564s">I</a> want to know how much money K.P. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4367.624s">Lawrence</a> received in the past year, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4375.947s">So</a> I can take a look at the Warren articles and I can say, oh, geez, we have a budget in the law department that says they're going to spend 200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4382.39s">But</a> I'm looking here in the last six months, we spent $1.7 million at KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4387.012s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4387.612s">And</a> I can get ahead of some of these issues so that come the budget in probably, we'll get away, maybe June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4393.975s">When</a> we get to June 30th for July 1st vote, I might be able to have a little bit of understanding as to why we're in the situation we're in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4423.55s">All</a> right, that's okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4485.028s">Has</a> the law department ever called you and said, the city council has asked us to draft <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4492.665s">No,</a> the law department's never called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4493.926s">So</a> the law department hasn't called you, the chief of staff hasn't called you, the mayor's office hasn't called you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4498.029s">But</a> this council's taking at least a dozen affirmative votes to get this information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4526.508s">I</a> feel bad that they said you already had to fall on your sword and be a sacrificial lamb.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4635.522s">of</a> this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4636.702s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4733.07s">It</a> might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4738.811s">It</a> says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=4981.715s">I'm</a> just curious if a rank and file employee, say in the Medford DPW for a year and a half, failed to provide you with information that you requested, what would happen to them?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6413.303s">First</a> of all, I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello for being outspoken in their efforts to raise awareness as to what's going on in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6426.711s">Neither</a> one of these gentlemen were required to appear for the school committee meeting last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6432.695s">They</a> did so as concerned parents, grandparents, and public servants here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6441.86s">And</a> when I listen to what they say, and I listen to what people on the street say, and when I listen to what my kids say, and I listen to what my wife has to say about these public schools as an educator at 25 years in a neighboring school district, it doesn't make me feel good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6464.165s">I</a> feel as though we're failing our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6468.306s">We're</a> failing the most vulnerable members of our population, our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6475.749s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli made a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6478.53s">He</a> said, it's the one year anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6480.891s">I</a> said, one year anniversary? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6481.831s">Are</a> you talking about one year anniversary or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6484.292s">One</a> year anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6484.992s">It's</a> December, Christmas hasn't happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6487.313s">I</a> go, one year anniversary or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6489.094s">He</a> goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6495.136s">The</a> two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6498.586s">because</a> of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6541.723s">And</a> I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6546.766s">We've</a> all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6550.068s">We've</a> all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6563.913s">Why</a> do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6570.017s">Because</a> we're not, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6573.74s">So</a> we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6577.182s">And</a> we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6588.408s">And</a> that's a shame because the city is better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6591.711s">The</a> city is better than that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6612.727s">And</a> we could all sit here and we can say, this isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6614.448s">And</a> this isn't wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6616.215s">but</a> the data doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6617.536s">The</a> numbers don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6619.217s">So</a> let's talk about the numbers a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6621.879s">Let's</a> talk about the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6622.94s">42%</a> proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate and 184th overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6631.306s">Our</a> kids deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6642.074s">Our</a> kids deserve better than what they get. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6643.695s">They</a> don't deserve to go to school afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6647.297s">They</a> deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6654.302s">Now,</a> when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6665.089s">And</a> I have to take a look at it and just mention it because <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6669.867s">I</a> think it really speaks volumes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6686.955s">This</a> is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6695.132s">Our</a> MHS is currently in a stay in place due to a medical emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6700.754s">A</a> student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6703.655s">Four</a> students have been identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6705.736s">The</a> police are here working with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6707.036s">We're</a> working on an official communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6710.298s">What's</a> that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6711.638s">We're</a> working on an official communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6714.219s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6715.8s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6717.62s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're gonna do to prevent it from happening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6723.729s">Here</a> we are 60 days ago, two short months ago, two short months ago, a girl was assaulted, terribly assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6737.4s">This</a> poor girl has to go to school every day, shake it in her boots. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6740.563s">If</a> it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6753.48s">It</a> would have gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6754.801s">And</a> then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6759.625s">And</a> then it would have gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6761.967s">And</a> then 60 days later, something else would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6764.509s">And</a> we'd bring it up again, and we'd start talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6767.691s">Let's</a> get serious about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6769.053s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6769.853s">It's</a> been a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6771.034s">It's</a> been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6774.897s">It's</a> been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6778.7s">All</a> right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6794.659s">This</a> is sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6796.28s">This</a> is sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6797.641s">And</a> nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6803.825s">The</a> way it's been handled is horrible, horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6806.687s">These</a> aren't isolated incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6808.948s">A</a> year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6813.851s">This</a> is not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6817.031s">And</a> the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident, the more isolated incidents are going to occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6826.455s">And</a> then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6830.556s">Well,</a> everybody wants to go to Minuteman, and everybody wants to go to the charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6834.018s">Well,</a> yeah, no kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6835.338s">Why</a> wouldn't they?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6848.024s">You</a> can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school where you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6858.326s">Or</a> you can take the risks and send them to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6861.507s">And</a> that's what parents are going to say to themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6863.007s">They're</a> going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6868.168s">And</a> parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6880.778s">I</a> hate to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6882.399s">Because</a> I went to the Hervey School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6885.24s">I</a> went to the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6887.562s">I</a> went to the Hopps School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6889.242s">I</a> went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6891.063s">I</a> played sports for Bud Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6893.024s">I</a> learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6895.946s">I</a> learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6901.689s">And</a> that's why I chose to seek public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6904.57s">And</a> when I sit here, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6906.603s">and</a> I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6912.828s">It's</a> okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=6919.453s">You</a> can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8443.317s">Madam</a> President, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8445.618s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8446.278s">You</a> know, there's no such thing as a utopian society. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8456.341s">And</a> I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue, and quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8463.997s">given</a> the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8470.698s">I</a> don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8477.4s">It</a> might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8491.883s">As</a> of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8493.762s">The</a> committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8499.767s">So</a> we can jump up and down and say, we want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8501.648s">We</a> want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8502.209s">We</a> do that every week about every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8504.67s">But</a> ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8519.502s">So</a> what's the plan and what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8522.013s">And</a> why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8528.295s">Quite</a> frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8532.637s">Blanket,</a> sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8536.559s">In</a> the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8542.541s">Because</a> a year has gone by and we haven't showed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8548.803s">So,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8551.198s">Certainly</a> someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8571.169s">Reversing</a> some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8579.348s">But</a> again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8584.51s">How</a> much is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8586.111s">There's</a> never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8587.691s">There's</a> never, we're never going to reach a point where we say, Oh, we're cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8590.052s">This</a> is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8590.753s">This</a> is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8593.274s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8593.614s">That</a> doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8595.435s">That</a> doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8596.255s">Nobody</a> says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8599.536s">That's</a> just not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8601.417s">So,</a> you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8605.639s">And</a> is this a good plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8607.125s">Because</a> throwing money at issues doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8608.866s">It's</a> not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8611.527s">And</a> it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8615.449s">So</a> maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8617.63s">And</a> then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8622.292s">Because</a> quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up, they just, anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's, we don't have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8629.755s">We</a> don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8630.756s">We</a> don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8632.882s">All</a> right, well, if you don't have any money to do it and it needs to get done, then what's the next thing you got to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8636.485s">You</a> got to reallocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8638.567s">You</a> got to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8640.349s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8641.45s">It's</a> like Belichick at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8645.173s">We're</a> not changing the game plan at halftime. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=8647.515s">We're</a> not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9251.315s">My</a> understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9255.038s">That's</a> my understanding.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9261.212s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9261.612s">And</a> do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9267.056s">What</a> was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9348.668s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9349.868s">Could</a> the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9354.369s">Not</a> according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9356.69s">Is</a> it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9364.871s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9365.171s">I'm</a> asking if the kid's getting expelled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9786.093s">So</a> they weren't there in a security capacity?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9810.511s">And</a> I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9816.736s">Most</a> high schools aren't on the news every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9819.359s">as</a> this as is on the news every day surrounding communities on the news every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9824.762s">All</a> right, and don't make this about the Medford City Council gets passionate about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9828.204s">So</a> it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school because that's nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9830.845s">All</a> right, because we don't make the policies up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9832.746s">All</a> right, the school committee does they're the ones that set the policies.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9844.432s">Why</a> is it 12 kids hanging on the bathroom?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9857.202s">I'm</a> not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9859.644s">I</a> have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9860.785s">You</a> don't have a point of information because you're not a Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9865.609s">I'm</a> finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9868.932s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9869.613s">So</a> what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school, how are they going to be safer than they were yesterday? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9877.539s">Let's</a> answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9878.791s">because</a> that's really what the people care about.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9929.479s">And</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9930.399s">And</a> to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9978.497s">but</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9979.417s">How</a> many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=9994.02s">Everybody's</a> interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10059.238s">I'm</a> a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies and I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10070.624s">on</a> that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10071.684s">These</a> events are happening over and over again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=10075.787s">Two</a> major events in the last 60 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15439.802s">nothing</a> more than what she's spending her Apple money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15442.544s">We</a> don't have any say whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15445.587s">So</a> I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15449.17s">I</a> mean, all it is is a dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15450.792s">I</a> really think it's nothing more than campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15453.074s">It's</a> really campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15453.934s">It</a> has nothing to do with what's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15455.776s">There's</a> nothing to do with what's going on with his body. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15457.497s">It's</a> campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15458.819s">So</a> I don't think that that should be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15460.12s">I</a> think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15489.934s">We</a> don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15496.619s">I</a> mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fxQMdebqk-Y&t=15501.983s">I</a> mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.<h2><a href="../2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE/2022-12-21__LyLALihqlE.html">Medford City Council Meeting 12-20-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5092.201s">It</a> might also be helpful to go talk to the city clerk and say, hey, can I see a copy of the council tracking sheet? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=5097.944s">It</a> says finance director, because there's probably literally 40 requests that we're looking for out of your office over the course of the last year.

<a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6848.22s">He</a> goes, no, you don't remember the two walkouts that happened last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6854.261s">The</a> two walkouts at Medford High School that happened last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6857.717s">because</a> of escalating violence in our public schools, when hundreds of children, hundreds of our students, our kids, our neighbors' children, our families got up out of their seats and they walked out of the school because they said, we can't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6873.707s">We've</a> had enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6877.65s">Here</a> we are exactly one year later. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6881.272s">I</a> don't think we're in a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6884.114s">I</a> think we're in a worse place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6887.27s">I</a> think we're in a worse place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6891.293s">We're</a> in a place where parents are shut out, don't have the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6897.538s">We're</a> in a place where our kids are afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6900.86s">And</a> I think we all know what happens when kids become afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6905.904s">We've</a> all seen the documentaries on how gangs are formed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6909.187s">We've</a> all heard the stories about kids that get bullied in school and then decide to bring weapons because they've had enough and shoot up schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6919.292s">We've</a> all seen this, it's happened in neighboring states. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6923.034s">Why</a> do we feel as though we're impervious to the same situation or the same circumstances? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6929.159s">Because</a> we're not, we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6932.861s">So</a> we're in a place where kids are afraid to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6936.303s">And</a> we're also in a place where we see embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story after embarrassing news story in the headlines with the word mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6947.52s">And</a> that's a shame because the city is better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6950.822s">The</a> city is better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6953.483s">And</a> our kids deserve better than what they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6959.547s">There's</a> no accountability that shows it shows in this culture that's permeating our school system is transcending into the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6971.854s">And</a> we can all sit here and we can say, this isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6973.575s">And</a> this isn't wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6975.336s">but</a> the data doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6976.677s">The</a> numbers don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6978.337s">So</a> let's talk about the numbers a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6980.998s">Let's</a> talk about the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6983.259s">42%</a> proficiency in math, 50% proficiency in reading, 240th in the state college readiness index, 181st in graduation rate, and 184th overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=6999.125s">Our</a> kids deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7001.226s">Our</a> kids deserve better than what they're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7003.493s">They</a> don't deserve to go to school afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7006.414s">They</a> deserve to go to school with leaders that are willing to step up and accept the challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7013.436s">Now,</a> when this incident first happened, I got an email and the email spoke volumes in terms of the culture that's going on with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7024.199s">And</a> I have to take a look at it and just mention it because I think it really speaks volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7031.361s">If</a> I can find it and remember how to work this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7046.083s">This</a> is a confidential and urgent update relative to the circumstances at Medford High School from Dr. Marice Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7054.208s">MHS</a> is currently in a stay-in-place due to a medical emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7059.864s">A</a> student was stabbed in the restroom and transported to MGH. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7062.785s">Four</a> students have been identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7064.866s">The</a> police are here working with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7066.167s">We're</a> working on an official communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7069.429s">What's</a> that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7070.769s">We're</a> working on an official communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7073.35s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7074.911s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7076.732s">You</a> shouldn't have to work on anything other than telling the people what happened and what you're going to do to prevent it from happening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7082.855s">Here</a> we are 60 days ago, two short months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7088.057s">Two</a> short months ago, a girl was assaulted. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7090.387s">terribly</a> assaulted, captured on video, broadcast all across the local news stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7096.532s">This</a> poor girl has to go to school every day, shaking in her boots. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7099.675s">If</a> it weren't for the strength of her parents, if it weren't for the strength of her parents coming up here week after week, day after day, fighting to raise awareness about these issues, it would have gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7113.966s">And</a> then 60 days later, we would have been talking about this gentleman that got assaulted and stabbed, and then it would have gone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7121.104s">And</a> then 60 days later, something else would happen and we'd bring it up again and we'd start talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7126.806s">Let's</a> get serious about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.166s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7128.967s">It's</a> been a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7130.147s">It's</a> been a year since the students in that school told us they've had enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7134.008s">It's</a> been a year since they all got up out of their desks and had the courage to walk out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7137.81s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7138.81s">They</a> had more courage than the adults in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7147.053s">And</a> now they have to have more courage than the adults in the building to go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7150.558s">because</a> they're scared for their safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7153.78s">This</a> is sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7155.402s">This</a> is sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7156.783s">And</a> nothing anybody can say when they come up to this podium, all right, is gonna change the way I feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7162.948s">The</a> way it's been handled is horrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.369s">Horrible.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7165.83s">These</a> aren't isolated incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7168.092s">A</a> year ago, one year ago, the whole school said we've had enough and they walked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7172.975s">This</a> is not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7176.178s">And</a> the longer we keep approaching this situation as an isolated incident, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7181.069s">The</a> more isolated incidents are going to occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7185.572s">And</a> then when the budget comes around, we're going to hear the school department cry poor mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7189.694s">Well,</a> everybody wants to go to Minuteman and everybody wants to go to the charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7193.156s">Well,</a> yeah, no kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7194.457s">Why</a> wouldn't they? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7196.558s">You're</a> going to sign your kid up for karate when they're five years old just to go to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7204.003s">You</a> can pay one way or you can pay the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7207.165s">You</a> can pay with peace of mind and financially send them to a school <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7211.374s">where</a> you feel as though they're going to be safe and you're going to receive what you deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7217.459s">Or</a> you can take the risks and send them to Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7220.621s">And</a> that's what parents are going to say to themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7222.142s">They're</a> going to say, is it worth it to me to spend this money to not have to put up with stuff like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7227.306s">And</a> parents are going to say yes, because I'm a parent that's thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7233.13s">I'm</a> losing faith in the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7237.914s">And</a> I hate to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7239.915s">I</a> hate to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7241.533s">Because</a> I went to the Hervey School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7244.355s">I</a> went to the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7246.676s">I</a> went to the Hopps School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7248.357s">I</a> went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7250.178s">I</a> played sports for Bud Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7252.139s">I</a> learned about what it's like to have blue and white in my veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7255.061s">I</a> learned about what it's like to be responsible, to want to be someone that gives back to his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7260.805s">And</a> that's why I chose to seek public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7263.686s">And</a> when I sit here and I watch some of my colleagues in government hide under their desk, it infuriates me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7271.96s">It's</a> okay to say no sometimes, you know, and it's okay to say yes, but what you have to do is say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7278.564s">You</a> can't stand for anything if you don't know where you stand and what you stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=7285.488s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8802.441s">Madam</a> President, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8804.743s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8805.403s">You</a> know, there's no such thing as a utopian society. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8815.489s">And</a> I don't think in this instance that throwing money at an issue and quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8823.123s">given</a> the decision makers who aren't allocating funds properly in the first place, more money to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8831.25s">I</a> don't think this is going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8836.534s">It</a> might help in the long run, but it's not going to do anything for those children that need to go to school tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8845.441s">What</a> this is about is reallocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8851.025s">As</a> of right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8852.895s">The</a> committee needs to live within its means because there is no funding request from the mayor before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8858.897s">So</a> we can jump up and down and say, we want more money, we want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8861.398s">We</a> do that every week about every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8863.799s">But</a> ultimately right now, the administration hasn't put the paper before this body, which tells me the administration isn't taking it seriously, which would again, move me to the position to say, you have to live within your means and reallocate your funds then to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8878.605s">So</a> what's the plan and what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8881.141s">And</a> why are our kids going back to school tomorrow if you don't have a plan and you don't know what you're gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8887.405s">Quite</a> frankly, I think the school should have been shut down until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8891.768s">Blanket,</a> sorry, high school's closed until after Christmas vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8895.691s">In</a> the interest of safety, in the interest of us showing this community that we're serious about the issues that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8901.674s">Because</a> a year has gone by and we haven't showed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8907.938s">So,</a> you know, I'm certainly someone that recognizes that there's a need for resources, but I also think that there is room for reallocation of existing funds, existing policies, and existing practices that will improve the safety in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8930.285s">Reversing</a> some of the policy decisions that were made over the last year is a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8938.473s">But</a> again, there's no such thing as a utopian society and there's never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8943.634s">How</a> much is enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8945.234s">There's</a> never going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8946.815s">There's</a> never, we're never going to reach a point where you say, Oh, we're cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.175s">This</a> is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8949.875s">This</a> is enough money for us to do whatever we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.396s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8952.736s">That</a> doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8954.556s">That</a> doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8955.376s">Nobody</a> says, I want to make less money next year than I made this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8958.657s">That's</a> just not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8960.537s">So,</a> you know, we can keep throwing money at issues or we can say, where are you allocating this money? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8964.758s">And</a> is this a good plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8966.257s">Because</a> throwing money at issues doesn't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8967.978s">It's</a> not going to fix the problem if we're not spending it in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8970.659s">And</a> it's clear that the money we've already provided isn't being spent in the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8974.581s">So</a> maybe it comes down to a reallocation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8976.763s">And</a> then what can we do to supplement that reallocation plan, but let them live with the existing means that they have? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8981.445s">Because</a> quite frankly, it seems like every time something comes up to just anything in this community, quite frankly, anytime anything comes up, it's we don't have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8988.889s">We</a> don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8989.869s">We</a> don't have any money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.011s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8992.311s">Well,</a> if you don't have any money to do it, it needs to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8994.212s">Then</a> what's the next thing you got to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8995.632s">You</a> got to reallocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8996.832s">You're</a> going to change your game plan up a little bit there, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=8999.473s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9000.874s">Bella</a> check at halftime, you know, change the game plan, win the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9004.294s">We're</a> not changing the game plan at halftime. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9006.635s">We're</a> not taking a real strong self-assessment as to where we stand and then making adjustments to improve our position.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9610.437s">My</a> understanding that the student was relatively new student in the school transfer student. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9614.159s">That's</a> my understanding.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9620.736s">And</a> do you feel as though this might be related to a bullying incident or something like that, an underlying bullying incident? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9626.18s">What</a> was the basis of the argument, the series of events or event that gave cause to arise to such an action?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9707.788s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9708.989s">Could</a> the student that stabbed the other student actually be let back into school? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9713.513s">Not</a> according to the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9715.836s">Is</a> it the intention of the school administration to expel that student?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.023s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=9724.324s">I'm</a> asking if the kid's getting expelled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10102.35s">Was</a> there a drug overdose? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10106.914s">Is</a> that what the drug overdose?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10120.683s">And</a> you did say that the police and the fire department were there today?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10125.746s">What</a> kind of support?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10145.211s">So</a> they weren't there in a security capacity?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10169.636s">And</a> I mean, I understand that, you know, violence happens in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10175.883s">Most</a> high schools on the news every day, though, ours is. Ours is on the news every day, surrounding communities on the news every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10183.908s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10184.388s">And</a> don't make this about the Medford City Council gets passionate about issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10187.329s">So</a> it's our fault that kids get stabbed in high school, because that's nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10189.949s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10190.229s">Because</a> we don't make the policies up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10191.87s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10192.33s">The</a> school committee does. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10193.19s">They're</a> the ones that set the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10194.79s">They're</a> the ones that are responsible.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10203.552s">Why</a> are the 12 kids hanging out in the bathroom?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10216.061s">I'm</a> not trying to hold you accountable for the words you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10218.763s">And</a> I have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10219.904s">You</a> don't have a point of information because you're not a Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10224.727s">I'm</a> finished, Madam President, because this is like ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.049s">This</a> is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10228.73s">So</a> what's the plan going forward tomorrow when these kids go back to school? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10232.472s">How</a> are they going to be safer than they were yesterday? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10236.655s">Let's</a> answer that question, because that's really what the people care about.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10289.303s">And</a> to all those people listening, when you go to the school committee, remember that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10337.645s">But</a> I just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10338.566s">How</a> many of those administrators and other individuals that were deployed in the hallways that trained in safety training, trained in how to keep somebody safe?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10350.756s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10351.356s">You</a> keep piping in too, because I'm trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10353.158s">Everybody's</a> interrupting each other, so maybe you should stop that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10418.614s">I'm</a> a little bit less concerned about the counseling of the traumatized bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10421.676s">And</a> I'm a little bit more concerned about how we're going to keep bodies safe from getting stabbed and beat up and fought and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10427.178s">So</a> obviously we've got a systemic problem there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10430.82s">These</a> events are happening over and over again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10434.982s">We've</a> had two major events in the last 60 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=10439.324s">It's</a> not isolated.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15118.737s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15798.919s">Nothing</a> more than what she's spending her apple money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15801.68s">We</a> don't have any say whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15804.722s">So</a> I don't understand why we need to entertain these presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15808.304s">I</a> mean, all it is is a dog and pony show. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15809.925s">I</a> really think it's nothing more than campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15812.206s">It's</a> really campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15813.067s">It</a> has nothing to do with what's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15814.887s">There's</a> nothing to do with what's going on with his body. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15816.488s">It's</a> campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15817.929s">So</a> I don't think that that should be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15819.25s">I</a> think that if the mayor is going to offer a paper that the paper should be related to issues that require council action by law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.215s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15846.515s">So,</a> so Madam President, what that really is, is that's a, <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15849.056s">We</a> don't want to do anything without doing anything because we want you guys to make sure that if we do it, you're not going to say anything bad if we make a mistake, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15855.739s">I</a> mean, ultimately they want verification and validation of the decisions that they make it, but we don't have to take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_LyLALihqlE&t=15861.102s">I</a> mean, come on, be a leader, make decisions.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_phPK_rgTxTg/2024-11-19_phPK_rgTxTg.html">City Council 12-06-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=715.987s">I</a> motion to adopt the lowest residential tax amendment present.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=769.635s">Just</a> for clarity, seek to amend it to adopt a minimum residential factor of 91.43.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=837.826s">The</a> motion is not to adopt a residential exemption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=938.861s">nine</a> times that I've taken this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=941.942s">Ultimately,</a> when we adopt a residential tax exemption, all we're doing is we're still taxing the same amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=948.843s">All</a> we're doing is shifting who are asking to give us that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=952.344s">And</a> based upon the analysis of our city assessor, the city assessor has shown that the break-even point would make more people actually pay more in taxes than those that would receive a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=962.766s">So</a> it didn't make sense mathematically for us to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=967.124s">there'd</a> be more people in the community that were seeing their tax bills actually increase, not decrease, based upon the assessment that was performed by our assessor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1268.675s">Just</a> one thing I'd like to point out, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1271.057s">In</a> looking at the presentation that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1273.499s">Bordeaux</a> put on back in August of this year, she did note that at a 20% owner-occupied exemption, the break-even point would be any home valued at $707,000 would be the break-even. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1289.563s">And</a> the only value over that would be receiving an incremental tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1296.486s">It</a> looks like for every 90,000 dollars, it goes up about 200 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1300.347s">Then</a> the next 90,000, it goes up about 400 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1301.588s">The</a> next 90,000, it goes up about 800 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1302.828s">The</a> next 90,000, it goes up about 1600 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1304.629s">The</a> next 90,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1308.01s">It</a> goes up up there to 200 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1309.951s">So</a> if you look at a property let's say like 23 pushing street down here in the city of Medfield which is assessed at $803,000 right now that home actually wouldn't even meet the requirements for the break even point that home would actually pay more in taxes than we pay without the exemption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1564.228s">It's</a> just going to move to not adopt a small commercial exemption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1624.638s">Motion</a> to not adopt.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1760.047s">I'm</a> tired of hearing from Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1761.367s">I</a> want this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1762.488s">I</a> just want it to be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1764.369s">Literally,</a> Eversource came in this community my first term in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1768.451s">This</a> is my fifth term. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1770.532s">It's</a> nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1771.533s">It</a> just needs to be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1774.014s">It</a> just needs to be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=1774.935s">These</a> people need relief in this neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3586.963s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3587.523s">So</a> just to recap, currently, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3593.734s">The</a> project that the work is not complete by the contractor right the city has not accepted the roadway correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3599.98s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3602.022s">The</a> applicant ever source is required to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3610.562s">a</a> field engineer, a city field engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3614.285s">Can</a> we get that information published on the Eversource pipeline website that we have here at the city, the page?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3623.092s">I</a> know, but can we get that information on there? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3624.693s">So</a> instead of people calling us, we can say, call the field engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3628.015s">He'll</a> tell you exactly what's going on tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3629.637s">You</a> don't want those calls either and you don't need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3632.479s">Everyone,</a> you're working on other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3633.8s">We</a> got a field engineer they're paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3635.501s">Why</a> are you going to take the calls? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3636.442s">That's</a> what he's here for.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3637.983s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3639.903s">Lastly,</a> when is it exactly with the drop dead project completion date?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3670.604s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3679.51s">I</a> mean, I'm going through my files here. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3682.212s">I</a> have April 30th, 2015, 19th, 2015, October 20th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3684.814s">It's</a> 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3696.027s">It</a> will be relatively soon, relatively soon it will be, you know, so this is something that needs to come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3703.54s">And</a> it needs to be done before school opens again because every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3709.857s">all</a> summer long, it's nice and quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3712.018s">And</a> then come the second, the third week in August, we decided we want to rip up every street in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3716.381s">I</a> mean, this year we did it at the Brooke school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3718.863s">Literally</a> the first day of school, let's start a construction project around four streets that surround the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3723.586s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3724.147s">We</a> need to plan better. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3725.668s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3725.908s">So</a> we, we, we can't put this neighborhood through any more undue strain and stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3732.512s">Now</a> I know there's a ton of benefits that come with this through the MOU. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3735.839s">Um,</a> I've exercised as much patience as I possibly can on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3739.502s">Um,</a> and I appreciate, um, all that you're going to try to do to get out of our city so that you can move on to the next eight miles of, uh, pipeline that you have to do somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3750.249s">I'm</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3750.63s">Um,</a> but with that being said, um, I'd like to see that, um, contact information published on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3756.334s">And,</a> um, I'd like to get a commitment from Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3758.175s">This</a> is going to be done before the opening of school.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3774.556s">If</a> I'd like to see a commitment that this is going to be completed before school reopens in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3778.938s">And</a> if we can't get that commitment that I'd like to see monthly written updates, relative to the progress of the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3786.162s">I'm</a> here in my hand I have a card from a gentleman from Watkins strategies his name was Sean so tell him he was the senior public affairs specialist for Watkins strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3795.567s">Back</a> when this job, he probably retired by now, it's been so long, but back when this job started, Sean would send us weekly updates and monthly updates saying, this is what to expect, this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3805.434s">We</a> also got updates like that with the Craddock Bridge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3808.496s">And</a> they'd say, the project is 73% complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3811.839s">We've</a> done this, this, and this, this week, next week we're doing this, this, and this. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=3815.021s">So</a> then we don't have to call, we don't have to do this, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4769.31s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4770.01s">I</a> think there's something else that we have to consider here. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4774.453s">There</a> are many pros and cons that come with living in a neighborhood that has a pocket <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4780.747s">or</a> living in a home that abuts a park. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4785.549s">One</a> of the largest cons is that a small, minor change at that particular location can have major quality of life issues for the people who live in those homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4800.455s">Look</a> at, for example, place that park on a Saturday morning in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4805.157s">Try</a> finding a parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4806.897s">Good</a> luck, good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4809.345s">Driveways</a> blocked every hour on the hour, can't get out of your driveway ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4815.948s">So</a> when you think about the mechanism that this administration loves to use to gather data, it usually consists of sitting behind a computer in an ivory tower, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4833.135s">If</a> you're gonna make a change, get out of city hall, get into the neighborhoods and talk to some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4838.873s">All</a> right, enough's enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4840.294s">Because</a> ultimately, if I get a survey about off-leash hours about a dog in the park, you know what I'm gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4845.938s">I</a> don't care about dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4846.759s">I'm</a> gonna take it and I'm gonna throw it in the trash and I'm not gonna respond, because I don't care about dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4850.121s">The</a> only people that are gonna respond are the people that do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4852.883s">So</a> you're gonna get a skewed data set right from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4855.966s">Right</a> from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4857.207s">Here's</a> a voluntary survey that we're posting on social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4861.53s">Okay,</a> so you have to have social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4863.791s">You</a> have to follow the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4867.619s">for</a> you to even have access to participate in this data collection tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4874.705s">Well,</a> that's not going to give us fair representation of the actual thoughts of the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4882.731s">The</a> data set's flawed right from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4885.274s">All</a> this is, is a way to say, I have some support to do something that I want to do because someone asked me to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4892.807s">All</a> right, it's not a good way to create public policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4895.488s">Get</a> out of the office, go talk to some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4897.469s">Have</a> a community meeting, have a neighborhood meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4899.629s">What</a> park are you gonna do it at? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4900.79s">If</a> you're gonna do it at this park, I'm sure you must have a neighborhood meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4903.491s">I'm</a> sure you must have called all the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4905.371s">I</a> mean, I remember when I sat here and the mayor sat there and we had to change all the notifications on any time anybody filed for a variance, just filed for a variance for 500 feet from the location in a circumference. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4920.042s">But</a> the mayor is going to change what goes on in these parks, which she, by the way, has zero authority to do, pursue it to two city ordinances and the parks and private policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4928.248s">But</a> that goes down a whole other path because, you know, if you don't know how government works, how are we going to get things done? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4933.952s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4935.113s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4935.694s">So</a> with that being said, I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this issue up, but ultimately these surveys don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4941.858s">They're</a> not representative of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4944.26s">And</a> I've just outlined the reasons why. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4946.261s">So</a> how about we stop with the surveys and stop with, you know, these half-assed approaches that operate in the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4957.908s">I</a> mean, cause that's really what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4959.329s">That's</a> really what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=4960.93s">And</a> pardon my French, but you know, I rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5813.714s">It's</a> upon the data that you just mentioned to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=5817.037s">It</a> sounds like 66% of the respondents, the dog owners, which is, and you said none would respond, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6196.716s">And</a> on that note, Councilor Tseng, I mean, you have me about one inch away from filing an amendment for this paper to bring back Frosty. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=6204.918s">So</a> thanks for bringing that up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7280.406s">Madam</a> President, one of the benefits of working remotely is that I have the opportunity to see the Camp Lejeune water contamination lawsuit commercial 600 times a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7292.433s">And</a> that would lead me to believe, if I'm seeing it that much, many of our veterans who are elderly in nature are seeing it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7300.818s">And</a> as we are all aware, whenever something like this comes up, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7304.48s">The</a> scam calls usually come along with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7307.203s">So</a> I was hoping that a veteran service director could set up a hotline for individuals to access that may be looking for information relative to the Camp Lejeune water contamination lawsuit, in an interest to protect them from scamming, phishing, spamming, phishing, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7324.123s">I</a> mean, ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7325.124s">It's</a> something we see out there every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7326.645s">You</a> know, the social attacks are more and more common. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7330.546s">And</a> I think it's important for us to take the steps necessary to provide our residents with the protections and safeguards that we can't, especially when something like this is being brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7340.031s">Ultimately,</a> it's a lawsuit that addresses <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7343.747s">Parkinson's</a> disease, cancer, and various other diseases that come along with the exposure to various contaminants, which would also lead one to believe that some of these individuals may not be in the best of health, which would make them even more vulnerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7357.158s">So</a> I'd ask that this correspondence be forwarded to the veteran service director with the support of my colleagues.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7400.383s">I'd</a> just like to amend the paper matter present to ask that that be published on the Vetted Services website.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7567.853s">Madam</a> President, ultimately, our parking department is destined to fail if we keep operating the way we are currently operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7576.281s">We</a> need to do something a little bit different. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7579.177s">Outreach,</a> we're all outraged about the outreach from Eversource, but our parking department goes and throws up meters all over the place without talking to anybody in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7587.159s">It</a> doesn't make sense to me, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7588.98s">What's</a> good for the goose is good for the gander. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7590.56s">We</a> should be holding our own employees to the same standards that we're holding those private contracts that are coming into the city to do business as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7597.862s">I</a> just had the opportunity to have a correspondence with the foreman. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7601.123s">of</a> the parking department and I asked him to meet with an individual who's working right across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7605.784s">As</a> a matter of fact, at 99 Riverside Ave, they're doing some construction work to the affordable housing units there. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7612.145s">And</a> I asked the foreman to meet with the superintendent of the construction job for the simple purpose of understanding what the parking rules and regulations are in the region and where he could park his trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7624.508s">I</a> sent that email to the foreman. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7626.066s">The</a> foreman never responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7627.168s">I</a> got an email from the director, CC'd with the mayor, with Nina, with the DPW director and the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7635.099s">All</a> right, this department's never gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7638.464s">It's</a> never gonna work if the foreman can't pick up the phone and talk to somebody on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7643.596s">All</a> right, that's what those offices are for, the foot patrol offices, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7646.638s">They're</a> down there, the parking enforcement offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7648.34s">They're</a> supposed to communicate with the individuals that are in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7652.943s">So</a> ultimately, I think that there is a very significant lack of communication coming out of that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7659.928s">There's</a> a significant lack of understanding among many of the residents in the neighborhood, what's expected of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7666.933s">And</a> there's a haphazard application of the enforcement policy that keeps people a little bit concerned about the way things are going. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=7676.4s">So</a> with that being said, I support the resolution wholeheartedly and thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8224.789s">Ultimately,</a> what I'm asking for is information relative to violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8228.74s">high</a> school. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8229.361s">There</a> have been a number of reports, a number of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8232.226s">I've</a> been contacted by a number of parents relative to this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8235.972s">And</a> I'd like to get a look at what data we're collecting up there to see if there are any trends or any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8243.65s">circumstances</a> going on that we need to know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8246.311s">Ultimately,</a> just like most other things in this community, we're left in the dark until brave parents and brave voices come up and fill us in on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8254.953s">And</a> I think that it's time that we take a look at this long and hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8258.734s">So</a> I've asked for the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8260.974s">I</a> understand that this data is going to be very interesting because the last two years have been very interesting relative to the population and the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8269.417s">But</a> I'd like to see what we have there and <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8271.885s">I</a> ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8274.487s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8309.774s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8311.255s">It's</a> been a longstanding practice that an employee <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8314.529s">for</a> the city of Medford who's injured in the line of work and receiving workers' compensation benefits would be entitled to utilize sick vacation time or other earned leave time to make themselves whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8326.24s">An</a> employee injured in the line of work would be compensated by the city, the self-insurer, at a rate of 60% of their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8334.727s">So</a> if an employee gets hurt at work and they're receiving comp benefits at 60% of their pay, they're not receiving 40% of their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8341.804s">And</a> most times that 40% goes to pay for small things that aren't important to families, like health insurance and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8349.21s">But</a> recently the city administration implemented a policy after some, I believe, 70 years on the books of allowing workers in this community to utilize their sick leave when on workers' compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8364.062s">The</a> city administration said, no, you can't anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8367.325s">And</a> I'm not sure why they would make such <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8372.093s">policy</a> of why they would take such steps to hurt families and put families in a bad financial situation on top of what's going on already with the injury that a worker suffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8386.618s">So</a> when looking at this, I've also seen that this allowance of the utilization of sick time for injured workers, collecting workers' compensation benefits is not applied even handedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8400.331s">It's</a> applied haphazardly. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8402.632s">If</a> this person, maybe you get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8404.472s">If</a> you're that person, maybe you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8406.032s">Yeah,</a> we're not doing that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8407.493s">No,</a> tomorrow we are, today we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8409.853s">So</a> quite frankly, if there were three people in the same department that got hurt, they might all get three different answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8418.535s">And</a> I don't think that that really works in the interest of humanitarianism, equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8426.935s">or</a> within the purpose of the Workers' Compensation Statute, or within the purpose of the utilization of John Sickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8432.837s">So</a> with that being said, I'm asking for an ordinance to be drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8435.698s">This</a> is something that's happening, it's real, it's happening right now to workers here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8440.64s">And</a> it needs to be addressed in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8443.561s">And</a> if KP Law doesn't write it, I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8446.042s">But</a> it needs to be done, and it needs to be done soon, because we need to protect these people.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8452.362s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8452.722s">Sick</a> time is earned time. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8453.923s">It's</a> their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8454.643s">They</a> earn it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8455.423s">It's</a> to be utilized when they're suffering an injury or an illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8459.604s">And</a> the administration is using their discretion to say, well, you're collecting workers' compensation benefits for an injury that you suffered in the line of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8466.445s">We're</a> not going to let you be made whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8468.446s">We're</a> not going to let you utilize your earned time so that you can pay for your health benefits, for your wife and your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8474.733s">It's</a> sick, it's sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8477.134s">And</a> from what I understand, whatever your union affiliation is, has a little bit of what to do with who's going to be the one that gets approved and who doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8487.217s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8488.157s">And</a> quite frankly, that's opening the city up. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8491.298s">That's</a> opening the city up to a number of liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8494.279s">A</a> number of liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8495.099s">It's</a> workers' compensation retaliation. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8496.76s">It's</a> discrimination against a disabled individual.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8504.953s">That's</a> my council college to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8651.114s">And</a> Councilor Scarpelli, an explanation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8654.536s">So</a> you get 60% of your wages replaced through the workers' compensation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8661.182s">Then</a> they utilize their accrued sick time to make up the other 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8665.706s">We</a> all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8666.426s">So</a> that they're made whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8667.848s">But</a> what happens in this circumstance is because they're not allowed to utilize that other 40%, they have to take that 40% from the 60%. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8676.004s">So,</a> because that's the only income they have, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8678.646s">So</a> now you're seeing a worker who's injured in the line of duty, who's not able to utilize their sick or vacation life, who's being compensated at 60% of their pay, but has a 40% liability that they have to pay back the city to keep the health insurance going. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8691.314s">So</a> in essence, if I got hurt on the job, I'd be getting paid 20% when I have accrued sick time in the bank that I could use to keep me whole and to keep my bills paid and to keep my family protected with health insurance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8712.304s">And</a> I know it's not, you know, it's complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8714.145s">It's</a> not the sexiest thing in the world, but I just happen to understand workers' comp, because that's what they do for a living.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8814.256s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8818.036s">Everybody</a> watched the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8818.977s">Metro</a> made the news again last night, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8820.977s">Metro</a> was on TV again. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8822.077s">And</a> once again, it was not to celebrate our community success. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8828.638s">Once</a> again, it was not to celebrate our community success. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8834.362s">Let's</a> think about it, the school renaming, the Diane Guarino disaster, violence at our public schools, but now a vote of no confidence by our teachers against the city administration and the school committee that passed overwhelmingly at a rate greater than 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8852.074s">After</a> listening to all the drama, <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8858.495s">community</a> outrage, the fear, and the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8863.756s">One</a> underlying theme that I keep hearing over and over again, no matter what the crisis is, is that people have no forum to voice their concerns, to voice their opinions, and to voice their criticisms of the school committee and the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8887.604s">This</a> council has made multiple requests for this to be addressed voluntarily, and nothing has happened, nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8895.83s">Individuals</a> go up to meetings that wanna speak and they're boxed out.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8946.059s">and</a> that she has to go through these lengths to publicize the situation to the extent that she has to get justice for her daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8955.285s">I</a> said it last week, and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8964.671s">I</a> think it's shameful the way that this situation is being handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8968.734s">And</a> I think it's shameful the way that those other situations that I mentioned are being handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8973.337s">And</a> I think it's time that we do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8978.138s">When</a> those people come up to this podium and they talk to us and they ask us for the opportunity to voice their concerns and their criticisms, we all tell them we're gonna stand with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=8989.465s">We</a> all tell them we're gonna do more.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9007.547s">She</a> told us that we all have a role in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9011.089s">And</a> she's absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9014.432s">And</a> this paper tonight is my first attempt at hoping to make this right, to address some of the inaction that this body and that the lower house, we'll call it, that the lower house has had as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9032.303s">Being</a> the city council, we have the opportunity to make ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9035.851s">We</a> have the opportunity to make ordinances that provide directives. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9040.693s">And</a> I think that underneath and based upon the circumstances that are surrounding us over the past several months, it's incumbent upon us to act.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9067.712s">I</a> know it's not in a perfect form. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9069.633s">I</a> know it's not in a final form. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9071.054s">I</a> know it's something that's going to need to be addressed and need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9074.376s">But</a> it's something that has teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9076.478s">It's</a> something that has teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9077.438s">It's</a> something that has requirements.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9093.806s">to</a> Nicole, to Rob, to Mrs. Guarino, to those that felt they didn't have an opportunity to speak during the school renaming, to the 400 teachers that stormed City Hall yesterday that feel as though no one's listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9110.274s">Someone's</a> listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9111.715s">Someone's</a> listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9113.536s">We</a> want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9114.876s">I</a> want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9115.657s">I</a> want to make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9116.897s">I</a> said that last week, and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=9119.639s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10531.457s">Madam</a> President, I must just say, if I can just interject, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10537.38s">If</a> I can just interject for just a moment, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10539.281s">The</a> issue isn't violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10543.065s">in</a> the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10544.306s">That's</a> just one component of many of the crises that have occurred over the last two and a half, three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10551.232s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10552.353s">The</a> issue is the body's total lack of an open forum or a vehicle to it for any individual in this community to address their elected school body or the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10565.944s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10566.825s">The</a> point <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10568.107s">I</a> want to point to the purpose of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10570.028s">The</a> purpose of the proposal is to improve communication with our stakeholders and establish a vehicle to increase their participation in the development of policies and procedures governing our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10581.356s">That's</a> what the purpose of this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10583.037s">So</a> when my colleague puts a B paper forward, I don't feel as though that really falls within the spirit of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10589.781s">And</a> the reason I say that is because just a couple of minutes ago, the gentleman made an amendment to Councilor Scarpelli's paper for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10597.645s">And</a> he asked that our finance director, Bob Dickinson, supply us with copies of the Warren articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10606.31s">Now</a> these copies of the Warren articles are something that we've been asking for now for, can anybody tell me? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10611.152s">Probably</a> the better part of three years that we still don't receive them, three years, Warren articles are where we spend our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10617.556s">We</a> don't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10618.376s">We've</a> been asking for it by way of ordinance, by way of council action multiple times and we don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10623.018s">So</a> right now we don't even know what the financial picture of this community is. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10628.027s">This</a> council's debated papers and entertained papers concerning a moratorium on spending until such time as the administration provides us with an accurate financial picture of what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10638.47s">The</a> administration has not done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10640.651s">So</a> it will be irresponsible for this body for us to say, hey, spend more money, even though we don't know if we even have any.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10656.7s">I</a> know you guys don't want to do me a cuppa because you were silent on the call the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10660.022s">And</a> I appreciate that you get for doing that, for having the courage to come up and speak on a call like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10664.084s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10664.504s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10666.245s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10666.745s">I</a> think you guys, it's great that you have the courage to do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10669.406s">But</a> here's the thing, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10671.167s">The</a> paper isn't about this one issue, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10674.008s">The</a> paper's about the way the body handles the public and the way the body handles the public when issues of crisis or catastrophe occur in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10683.259s">All</a> right, now, last I checked, there was no lawyer in city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10687.961s">We</a> got a lot of legal opinions flying around this room right now, but there's no lawyer in city hall last I checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10692.283s">We</a> talked about that a little while ago too. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10695.205s">So</a> maybe the paper won't pass this muster, maybe it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10697.586s">Why</a> don't we send it to them and say, do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10699.947s">Tell</a> us why you won't comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10701.848s">Why</a> don't you wanna do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10703.048s">Why</a> don't you wanna listen to the people that put you here? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10705.87s">Why</a> don't you wanna earn your paycheck? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10708.131s">Or</a> you can challenge it, or you can just comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10710.931s">If</a> you can challenge it, you can comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10712.572s">Why</a> don't you just adopt a policy that says, all we're asking for here is three hours a month, three hours a month to earn your paycheck. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10720.695s">That's</a> not too much, I don't think, to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10722.755s">I</a> don't think that's too much to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10725.056s">Send</a> it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10725.717s">Let</a> them say, no, we're not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10727.257s">Then</a> they can tell us why they don't want to hear from the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10736.702s">Let</a> them say to us, Oh, well, you know, yeah, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10740.744s">I</a> don't really care that's not that important to me, I don't really want to listen to what you have to say or they could they could just clearly say, because we don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10749.329s">But</a> then we'll know where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10750.49s">Then</a> we'll know where was, then we'll know where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=10754.492s">I</a> read for people, not for prestige, not for any other reason.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11534.625s">I</a> mean, all she wants to do is prevent this from coming out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=11999.263s">As</a> I noted in my presentation with the paper, I did say the paper needs work. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12007.151s">I</a> did make a motion to move approval with the understanding that the paper probably doesn't have the support and it's going to die. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12016.11s">I</a> would be willing to withdraw my motion to move approval and have the paper referred to committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12022.453s">For</a> us to meet within the next 30 days to discuss some real legitimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12028.916s">Options</a> and opportunities for us to pursue certainly, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12033.318s">The</a> councils have recent issues and concerns and a lot of them surround. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12038.068s">legal</a> basis and whether or not we're able to take such action. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12042.529s">I</a> certainly feel that we're in a position to do certain aspects of what we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12046.75s">Maybe</a> forfeiting their pay isn't something that we can do, but maybe wiping it out of the budget the next year is something we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12054.212s">So</a> there's different things that we can put in place and different protocols we can put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12058.273s">So</a> I'd be happy to sit down and further discuss language or put together a small working group of members of council to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12065.315s">in</a> the interest of time, because ultimately, you know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12068.717s">Branley</a> is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12069.358s">What's</a> the proposal? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12070.078s">Where</a> are we going with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12070.898s">You</a> know, if we're going to vote on it, it's going to die, and then we can't bring anything back for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12073.96s">It's</a> a simple matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/phPK_rgTxTg&t=12075.461s">We're</a> better off keeping it in the committee and trying to work on something and getting it out there instead of with a paper vote that's going to fail and then be parliamentarily precluded from being brought back for 90 days.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_PB78UXxOSC0/2024-11-19_PB78UXxOSC0.html">City Council 11-29-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1893.71s">I'm</a> understanding you're working in a part-time capacity here in this community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=1896.551s">And</a> that you've moved on, you've left Medford and you're working in another neighboring community at this point in time as well.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2912.763s">Madam</a> President, the only reason that I brought the motion forward was because I noticed that we had an inordinate number of people on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2919.169s">And</a> after looking at what was left on the agenda, I don't think that they were too concerned about fiber optics funding from our APA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=2926.036s">So</a> that's why I just wanted to make sure that in the interest of time, that these people have taken time away from their family to be here, that they had the opportunity to be heard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3919.069s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3920.53s">Um,</a> first of all, um <a

under the rug. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3941.712s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3942.812s">Um,</a> it takes a lot for someone who's been so invested in this community for so many years to get up and to do what she's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3952.535s">And</a> I know that the last thing that she wants to be in the last thing she wants her family to be is the center of attention surrounded by such negative energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3961.217s">Um,</a> so, you know, Nicole, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3964.497s">And</a> through you to, to Rob and your daughter, um, for putting up the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3970.898s">Um,</a> because if you weren't going to talk about it, it was going to go away and you're not letting it go away and you shouldn't, um, ultimately, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3982.551s">There's</a> been a systemic failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3984.833s">The</a> systems failed you and it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3990.097s">And</a> it's not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3993.08s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3993.42s">We</a> hear the stories every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=3995.582s">Um,</a> the same mayor that chases down room is putting GPS trackers on, on city employees cars is the same mayor that's trying to control the narrative on this, but this administration should be doing is reaching out to this family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4011.565s">to</a> see what they can do to protect the family, not reaching out to the newspapers to see how they can control a narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4018.348s">I</a> think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4019.989s">I</a> think it's absolutely shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4022.49s">When</a> I sit back and I think to just a few years ago, when I mentioned it previously, we had a city councilor standing in the auditorium at Medford high school, screaming and yelling like a lunatic at the superintendent over a gun magazine that was found in a little theater after a private rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4042.356s">I'm</a> still waiting for that former city councilor who's now a mayor to have this conversation with her superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4051.839s">Cause</a> I don't think it's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4053.359s">I</a> haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4055.74s">There</a> are safety issues in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4057.961s">There's</a> no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4059.141s">This</a> is not an isolated incident. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4062.242s">What</a> happened to Nicole's daughter wasn't just kids being kids that got into a disagreement that ended up in a fistfight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4072.377s">It</a> was a criminal attack, an organized criminal attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4078.36s">And</a> it's, it's, it's sickening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4079.8s">It's</a> sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4080.981s">It's</a> sad to see that this woman can't get answers, that she can't send her daughter to school to receive an education and have the peace of mind that her child's going to be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4094.906s">Imagine</a> sending your kid off every day, a nervous wreck. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4097.948s">It's</a> bad enough out there in the world, not having to worry about things like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4101.469s">And</a> imagine sending your kid off to school every single day being a nervous wreck, wondering if today's going to be the day that you get another phone call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4111.334s">You</a> know, consultants, consultants, consultants, meetings, consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4119.858s">We</a> have a pretty well-paid administrative staff over in the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4125.48s">We</a> have people that are making salaries over $200,000, but we need consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4136.262s">The</a> focus should be on the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4138.363s">The</a> focus should be on the victim. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4142.005s">Quite</a> frankly, I think Mr. Greenspan should be involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4145.226s">I</a> think immediately after this occurred, Mr. Greenspan should have reached out to the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4149.988s">He</a> is the attorney for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4152.769s">I</a> don't understand why Mr. Greenspan hasn't sat down with the family yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4159.032s">The</a> superintendent should have been over at the house, visiting the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4163.154s">They</a> should have been at the hospital to make sure that she was okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4168.851s">Those</a> are the things that happen in the community where our leaders are vested. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4177.674s">Imagine</a> being a parent and after this happens, you pick up the phone and you call the superintendent's office and they tell you that she's on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4186.877s">Talk</a> to me in a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4188.398s">Are</a> you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4188.918s">Are</a> you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4192.339s">It's</a> craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4193.559s">It's</a> absolute craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4196.52s">Nicole,</a> I stand with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4198.79s">And</a> I stand with the other families who have gone through this very same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4204.694s">And</a> quite frankly, I have kids in the public school system too, and it hasn't been a pretty ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4209.998s">You</a> know, my third grader has quite a bit of trouble at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4213.621s">Seventh</a> graders in the playground at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4215.983s">The</a> seventh graders have no business at the playground in the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4218.385s">Why</a> are they there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4220.046s">You</a> know, what steps are we taking to make sure that our schools are safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4224.329s">And</a> why isn't the mayor acting <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4226.361s">with</a> the same outrage that she acted with previously when a far less severe incident happened, when nobody got hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4234.803s">These</a> are the questions that I ask myself every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4237.143s">These</a> are leadership issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4239.224s">I'll</a> walk through the fire with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4241.444s">I</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4242.205s">I</a> think this is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4243.905s">And</a> I think that there are some resources out there and there are some ideas for us to pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4248.566s">Like</a> George said, you shouldn't be considering out-of-district placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4252.047s">You</a> shouldn't have to be forced <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4253.766s">to</a> spend money to send your daughter to another school because you're not feeling safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4257.929s">But</a> maybe the city should do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4259.109s">Maybe</a> the city should send her to the charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4260.75s">Maybe</a> the city should get her in there then. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4262.992s">Maybe</a> the city should take some affirmative steps to be sure that your tax dollars are being well spent and that your family is being protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4269.976s">The</a> number one role in government is to make sure that our community is safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4273.398s">And</a> we're failing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4274.519s">And</a> we're failing our most vulnerable citizens, our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4277.741s">So</a> for that, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4278.981s">And</a> I look at this as a reflection of the failure of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4282.156s">not</a> just the administration, not just the school department of government as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4285.439s">And</a> as Nicole said at the beginning, very astutely, we all have a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4290.584s">I</a> wanna make it right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=4787.669s">I</a> was just wondering if the dog and pony show was over now or if we're good to go.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PB78UXxOSC0&t=7294.489s">participate</a> during public participation, but he's having some technical difficulties raising his hand if he's still on the call.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_0KXMJeS8U04/2024-11-19_0KXMJeS8U04.html">City Council 11-15-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1081.949s">I'm</a> afraid of the classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1085.21s">He</a> didn't give him a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1087.23s">So</a> he's getting like a $20 a week raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1090.351s">No,</a> because he's going up from a $20 to a $21. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1092.051s">So</a> it's probably like a $300 a week, $400 a week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1100.253s">The</a> difference between what was budgeted for this fiscal year and the upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1102.914s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1103.714s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1110.364s">Can</a> the chief of staff explain to us when exactly we are gonna receive any of this financial information that we requested in January of 2020 at the first meeting of this Medford City Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1118.629s">And</a> I believe if we look at the agenda here, the 33rd, we're now at the 33rd regular meeting at the first meeting, we requested quarterly financial updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1127.193s">And</a> we also requested that we receive monthly copies of the Warren articles with 33 meetings in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1132.656s">We've</a> never ever once received any of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1137.058s">But</a> yet, week after week, we are asked to make votes on financial appropriations, on spending, on upgrades, on items that really revolve around finances in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1148.302s">And</a> I don't think it's fair to us that you're gonna keep us here in the dark and make us beg for information that we've been asking for for the better part of a year now, 33 regular meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1159.646s">It's</a> not fair to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1161.189s">It's</a> not fair to us to put us in a position where you're not going to give us the information and the tools necessary to make good decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1168.153s">So</a> here we are again, treated like mushrooms, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1171.375s">Put</a> them in the closet, shut the lights off, throw one on them and see what grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1175.458s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1175.678s">Cause</a> that's what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1176.978s">I</a> mean, ultimately at the end of the day, that's what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1180.1s">You</a> know, week in and week out, it's the same reiteration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1183.262s">We</a> haven't asked for much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1184.023s">We've</a> said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1184.743s">Give</a> us a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1185.303s">We</a> had to fight for that for nine months. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1186.884s">Still</a> don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1188.309s">10</a> months we've been asking for just simple, basic financial information so that we could make good financial decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1192.293s">We</a> still don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1193.874s">So</a> I'm at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1195.776s">The</a> city's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1197.358s">The</a> city's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1198.178s">Our</a> schools aren't safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1199.36s">We</a> don't know what the financial picture is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1201.802s">We</a> have a finance director who told us right now that he can't give us an update because the reconciliations are off and the information that I give you is probably gonna be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1209.769s">But</a> we're being asked to spend week in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1213.927s">week</a> in and week out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1214.827s">I'll</a> say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1215.888s">The</a> city's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1217.169s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1217.489s">We</a> don't know what our financial picture is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1218.789s">And</a> our schools aren't safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1220.71s">What</a> more is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1222.311s">What</a> more is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1223.132s">A</a> strong financial background, a strong, stable, local finance department, you know, strong public education system. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1232.816s">We're</a> failing in both aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1234.837s">At</a> least I feel as though we are, because I'm not receiving any information to the contrary. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=1239.92s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.

<a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4027.234s">I</a> mean, geez, we talked about all these positions that couldn't be filled, but here we are, we have a paper that was given to us at our last meeting, and they expect it to be filled today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4035.596s">This</a> is amazing to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4037.137s">You</a> know why it's amazing to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4038.497s">Because</a> it's not fair and it's not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4040.637s">Because</a> when we had a presentation last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4043.675s">it</a> became very clear to me that this job was spoken for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0KXMJeS8U04&t=4047.498s">All</a> right?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1423.27s">I</a> just like to point out, this is an existing business in the community already. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1427.875s">All</a> right, they have about 50-60 employees here in this community that contribute to the circular flow of our local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1435.722s">The</a> proposed use, in my opinion, is less detrimental than the current use. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1439.426s">I</a> don't think that it really makes a big difference in terms of the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1443.289s">in</a> traffic or safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1445.491s">And</a> that's supported through the statements of our chief of police and our chief of fire in the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1452.116s">So</a> when I look at this proposal that's before us, I see a business here that exists in our community, that's looking to expand in our community and invest in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1459.822s">And</a> I think we should make it easy for them, not hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1462.224s">So</a> I will support this paper in the statement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1570.391s">Could</a> one argue that this is a ride share program and ride shares are designed to take cars off the street and therefore they have an environmental impact that's positive.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1727.286s">We</a> have a statement from the chief of police saying that there is no anticipated traffic impact.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1885.09s">Is</a> failure to react within the 90 day window considered a constructive acceptance of the application?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1892.536s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1943.104s">It</a> was just whether or not failure to act within the specified timeframe under state law would constitute a constructive acceptance of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1949.408s">So</a> it'd be like a yes vote, or if it would be that they'd have to sue us to do something, you know what I mean?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=1954.671s">I</a> just wanna have the things that go to committee and then never come out, and then have us put in a position where it's acceptance by inaction versus taking a vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3683.859s">Our</a> city is an absolute human resource nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3689.521s">That's</a> been clear, it's been well documented across many, many news media outlets, social media, and the like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3697.444s">I</a> think we can all agree, human resources is a problem here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3701.366s">And</a> financially, financially this administration practices absolutely zero fiscal constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3708.271s">All</a> right, zero fiscal constraint. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3710.092s">For</a> literal years, literal years, not weeks, not months, literal years, this council has been begging for quarterly reports from our auditor outlining the financial health and well-being of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3725.745s">The</a> city council, which is responsible for the appropriation of funds, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3729.788s">The</a> Harry Truman function of government, the buck stops here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3734.637s">We've</a> been asking for these documents for literal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3737.558s">Meetings</a> about the financial health and well-being of the city, and we can't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3741.941s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3742.421s">We've</a> been asking for copies of the monthly Warren articles, which are documents that show where our money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3749.324s">We</a> can't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3751.667s">I</a> get a response in my email today from our city auditor, our CFO, our finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3757.909s">Due</a> to our current staffing levels and the backlog of conciliations, our reports would be based on unaudited and possibly incomplete data. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3767.993s">Every</a> effort is being made to bring this data up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3771.875s">This</a> office cannot say that these desired reports would be accurate to any degree expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3778.357s">Let's</a> spend more money though. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3780.388s">Let's</a> go spend more money, create more jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3782.69s">A</a> job, by the way, that it sounds like the position's already spoken for.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3792.037s">With</a> a report from our CFO that pretty much says, I'd love to give you an update on the financial well-being of this community, but if I did it, it's garbage in, garbage out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3803.005s">It's</a> not gonna be based on accurate information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3816.668s">The</a> buck has to stop somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3818.989s">I'm</a> not saying this isn't a position that's a good position. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3821.632s">I'm</a> not saying it's a position that's warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3823.533s">I</a> don't think it's as important as an assistant city solicitor to the Metro City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3827.837s">I</a> don't think it's as important as a city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3831.059s">I</a> don't think it's as important as assistant city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3833.942s">You</a> know, we can only put cones up on every intersection around the city so many times, people are gonna run out of things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3839.157s">All</a> right, so ultimately, I find this to be fiscally irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3843.518s">I</a> mean, how can we as a body sit here and take vote after vote, multiple votes? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3846.959s">I'm</a> not talking one vote or two votes or three votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3849.019s">We've</a> taken dozens of votes on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3850.399s">We've</a> asked the city solicitor to come up with an ordinance mandating the administration to provide us with this information because they refuse to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3861.662s">But</a> here we are being asked again to create a new job, to spend more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3866.443s">I</a> want us to all think back to that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3869.11s">In</a> late June, when we sat here, and the mayor was taking money out of the public utilities account to keep the lights on, to move money around, to provide this council with the demands that we made. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3884.717s">And</a> that was the only way we could do it, because there's no more money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=3897.502s">I</a> can't support this paper this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4600.818s">I'm</a> going to invoke rule 20 from our city council rules, and this is a finance paper that's going to be laid on the table for one week's time, regardless of what happens tonight, because we have the right to do that as a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4614.03s">I</a> was the first time I've seen this appropriation request on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4618.112s">And</a> as such, I'm going to vote my rights under Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4620.754s">It's</a> old Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4621.274s">I</a> don't know what new rule is, but we leave them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4623.435s">We</a> never got copies of the rules after we approved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4625.517s">I'll</a> have them posted up on the website, I don't think. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4627.958s">Oh,</a> it is Rule 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=4628.538s">It's</a> definitely Rule 20.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5142.999s">Madam</a> President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading and move for approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5174.748s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5573.51s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5574.911s">Steve</a> was a dear friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5577.532s">One</a> of the first people to ever come up and volunteer to work on my first campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5584.194s">back</a> in 2013 and I met him through politics going back 20 years and he was always a gentleman that I held in high regard and someone who over that period of time I was able to develop a great friendship with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5597.946s">I</a> just want to express my deep sincere condolences to the family, to Christine especially, on this sudden and tragic loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5607.433s">Steve</a> was a lot of things to a lot of people here in Medford and the Medford Housing Authority is evident <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5612.258s">by</a> the number of residents that attended his memorial service. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5616.622s">And</a> he was a lot more than that, the people that he called family and friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5621.907s">So</a> with that being said, Medford is not better off today than it was yesterday with the loss of someone like Steve Gattaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5629.434s">And</a> if we could all be a little bit more like Steve Gattaro, I think Medford is moving in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5633.578s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=5672.224s">So</a> on the motion of Councilor carb yellow, we could just dedicate tonight's meeting on Steve's memory, Madam President, based upon as he has a service to our community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6458.6s">Can</a> you bring up the chief of police's support of this measure or not?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6515.228s">We're</a> in a situation here in this community that's bordering on what I'd find to be a financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6521.652s">You</a> know, when we talk about spending, we talk about the sharing of information, and more importantly, we talk about that letter that we received from the administration, October 25th at 1.40 p.m., which was today at 1.40 after several months of making requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6539.021s">I</a> think it's very troubling and scary that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6542.556s">The</a> city has a backlog of reconciliation reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6546.98s">They</a> haven't been audited. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6548.901s">They're</a> utilizing incomplete data. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6551.844s">And</a> they cannot say that they have accurately designed reports for financial reporting here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6559.13s">And</a> that's coming right from our CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6560.931s">That's</a> troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6562.033s">That's</a> very troubling, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6563.493s">So</a> the administration is spending and spending and spending, but I see no efforts being made to right the ship, especially with this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6571.776s">And</a> this body has extended multiple olive branches for a period of 36 months, trying to get to the bottom of this stuff and be a partner and we're not being brought to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6581.359s">Um,</a> so, you know, as I stated a couple of weeks ago, when we talk about the financial health in this community, let's be real about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6587.421s">Um,</a> we had no treasurer collector from, <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6590.318s">January</a> of 2020 to October 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6592.94s">We've</a> had no budget director from July of 2020 to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6598.263s">We've</a> had no CFO from September of 2021 to March of 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6601.244s">We've</a> had <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6604.648s">no</a> federal fund manager from 321 to 222. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6608.469s">And</a> we've had no assessor from 522 to the present. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6613.031s">So</a> when we sit down and we talk about our financial health in this community, we don't even have a finance team in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6619.754s">We</a> haven't had a finance team in place, but we're still being asked to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6624.616s">And</a> when we ask for the information that we need to make informed decisions, we're not being provided it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6628.669s">which</a> leads me to believe that they have something to hide. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6631.93s">Councilor</a> Caraviello has asked at least 30 times, how much money are we spending on outside legal counsel? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6638.192s">The</a> administration spent something ridiculous like $65,000 to follow around an employee and put GPS on his car to get a report that comes back absolutely unfounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6649.415s">And</a> the investigation starts off, I heard a rumor about a guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6653.516s">I</a> mean, that's what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6654.496s">We're</a> spending $80,000 in taxpayer money to chase down rumors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6658.403s">Come</a> on, let's get real. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6660.684s">So</a> when I look at the circumstances in this community and what's going on, we need to stop the bleeding somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6666.907s">And</a> I think that this is the best way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6669.769s">So</a> I'd ask that we put a spending moratorium on until such time as we get our quarterly report from our financial director. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6676.872s">We</a> get brought up to speed as to what's really going on in that finance office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6681.114s">The</a> numbers don't add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6682.495s">If</a> the numbers don't add up, we can't just keep on spending and spending and spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6688.598s">making</a> assumptions off of inaccurate data and inaccurate estimations, how are we ever going to put the city in a position to succeed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6697.762s">You</a> know, we have no tax assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6699.163s">We</a> have nobody to levy taxes in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6701.444s">We</a> finally have a treasurer collective out this whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6703.865s">But</a> for the first 10 months of the administration, we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6706.186s">We</a> had some of those working part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6707.867s">Rumor</a> has it the calls were getting wired to a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6709.788s">They</a> weren't even coming in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6711.889s">We</a> have people that are getting paid now outside the budget in acting positions that are also working in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6718.265s">All</a> right, their vested interest and their loyalties don't lie here in the city of Medford any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6722.148s">All</a> right, they're being paid for the city to comply with statute, not for any other reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6728.793s">All</a> right, so we need to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6731.215s">And</a> this is my next best solution that I could come up with based upon the plethora of resolutions that we filed, the number of questions that we've asked, the number of promises that have been made, but not fulfilled through the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6743.684s">We</a> still don't have a city assistant city solicitor for the council and the position hasn't been posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6748.403s">So</a> with that being said, I offer the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6751.505s">I</a> don't anticipate it passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6752.966s">I</a> don't want to hold the city financially hostage. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6755.388s">If</a> good things are going to happen in this community, they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6758.37s">They</a> should. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6759.151s">But</a> at the same time, you can't ask us to keep spending money without telling us what the financial picture is, what our financial health and wellness is in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6853.964s">And</a> if I could just add to that paper that the city council request the administration prepare an RFI for the city council to review relative to the hiring of an independent outside auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6871.088s">Council</a> like would you mind repeating your men, please, the city administration produce an RFR an RF an RFR an RFP for the city council to review relative to the selection and hiring of an outside independent auditor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6923.077s">He's</a> on the line for a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=6924.177s">Let's</a> get him down here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=7085.883s">Right,</a> well, I wouldn't mind going back to it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8279.81s">I</a> mean, I'm not sure the answer either but I don't know if you're going to say something I was going to say attention to what's going on here all things back and have been a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8288.234s">In</a> terms of, you know, the media is that they're putting up on Boynton Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8294.458s">Issues</a> of tickets on streets that not permit streets and tickets that are going on guys that say they're on one street and they're on another street so <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8301.878s">In</a> terms of our PACHA program and the application thereof, I don't think we're doing anybody a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8309.605s">As</a> the program continues to mature and develop, I'm seeing a lot more signage and a lot more meters go up across the community, but I'm not really seeing <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8320.839s">The</a> data driven methodology as to why they're putting these in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8325.242s">I</a> know that being common street with the development that's going to occur at Titan Gas Station at some point, the development that's going to occur up at Nathan Electric in the expansion of the Green Line, that area has been under particular scrutiny based upon what's going to happen when the Green Line comes active. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8348.539s">But</a> in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8351.148s">who</a> has the overall authority to implement and initiate those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8354.449s">It's</a> really the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8355.91s">I'm</a> not here in the city, but I know the city did something, because the end of Albion Street wasn't a mentioned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8361.392s">It</a> was a simple project, but it was invented.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8365.533s">But</a> the house is invented, but the street right in front of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8369.275s">I</a> looked at the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8370.155s">Because</a> it's a disaster what they've done over there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8958.091s">Did</a> anybody, I actually I'm still waiting for the mayor to go yell at her superintendent like she yelled at Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8965.603s">because</a> this issue right here is scary, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8968.885s">This</a> isn't someone dropped something out of their pocket, it was found in the little theater by a custodian. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8973.107s">This</a> is a student got assaulted, stalked, assaulted, tracked down, five adults, six adults, seven adults, nine adults, 10 adults watching, no one intervening. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=8983.314s">I'm</a> waiting for the mayor to go and treat her superintendent like she treated Roy Belson.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9153.884s">I</a> just, I mean, I'm thinking back to this whole situation where the mayor's at Fox 25 down in front of the school department over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9163.287s">She</a> called them herself talking about the gun clip, calls for a press conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9167.288s">The</a> school committee comes, they put Roy Belson on the stage in the little theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9171.449s">And</a> he sat there for four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9173.549s">And</a> after 40 years of service to the city guard, his head beat it for hours and hours and hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9178.451s">And</a> the mayor led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9180.211s">The</a> mayor led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9181.932s">She</a> was like a raven lunatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9184.087s">getting</a> up out of the crowd, running up to the microphone, yelling and screaming at people. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9188.328s">It</a> was nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/KttEmL8hj40&t=9189.388s">And</a> now to have something like this happen under her watch and to not hold her own people accountable to the same level and same accord is shameful, in my opinion.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_80br4JUepho/2024-11-19_80br4JUepho.html">City Council 10-11-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=603.822s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=604.642s">I</a> do believe, oh, it must be about a year and a half ago now, this council passed a measure and we sent it to the administration and shocker, never got a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=612.965s">But</a> what we asked for was the administration to analyze the feasibility of creating an Italian-American cultural district in South Medford to commemorate the contributions of many of our Italian-American residents here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=627.909s">When</a> you think about people like <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=633.1s">Ernesto</a> Martini, Alfredo Russo, and the likes, people that really made a big difference in this community over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=640.585s">We've</a> asked the administration to look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=644.443s">Year</a> and a half might have gone by now, and we still haven't received anything from it, from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=649.408s">So</a> I know it's only been a year and a half, and it's usually about three years before we get something back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=654.793s">But</a> I'm hoping that maybe we can put a reminder into the administration as maybe a B paper or as an amendment to this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=661.078s">I'm</a> asking for an update from the administration on the feasibility of creating an Italian American cultural district as passed by the council previously.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1373.483s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much and thank you to Councilor Caraviello for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1377.425s">I've</a> known Barbara DeCristofaro for as long as I can remember growing up in the same neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1382.166s">Friendly</a> with her father, Jerry, for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1383.807s">He</a> was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1385.616s">It's</a> glad it's great to see Barbara pursue this promotional opportunity to be appointed by the administration to position sergeant. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1392.46s">And</a> I think it's important that you know the brass and our police department is reflective of the population that we serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1398.744s">So</a> with that being said, I'm hoping that I reach out director will take steps to encourage minority and female police officers to take these promotional exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1407.029s">for</a> Barbara to be promoted the first female sergeant in the city of Medford in the year 2022 is kind of showing that our internal recruitment is lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1418.889s">And</a> we have many talented police officers that are here in this community that would help make the brass in our police department reflective of the population that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1429.96s">But</a> we have to encourage those individuals to apply for the civil service exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1434.525s">We</a> need to provide them with the tools necessary to study for the civil service exams so that they'll be in a position <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1449.217s">for</a> being one of the first.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1658.834s">Madam</a> President, as part of this paper just like an update from the city administration is Council beers mentioned, we had a $1 million grant project that was funded for the safe routes to school, and that created a bike lane from maybe halfway up the hill on high street to the work school, but part of that project also reconfigured the intersection at Wilbur Street high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1677.521s">And</a> since that time, property, personal residents that have bought <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1686.323s">including</a> flooding, drainage issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1689.606s">We've</a> seen McKay construction out there at least six times since this project was supposed to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=1696.911s">So</a> I'd just like to get an update from the administration as to what the status of the drainage issue is on the corner of Woobin and High Street and how much money the city's expended since the completion of the $1 million grant project and remedying the design defects and on property damage claims since this project's been completed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2160.473s">Can</a> you just explain what the significance of October 26th is?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2435.683s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2436.424s">Madam</a> President, the city clerk be so kind as to investigate report back to the council as to whether or not BJ says any special permits extended our permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2444.669s">So</a> like, I think one way that we may be able to address this is by bringing them in and saying this is an issue that's going on in the community and you have a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2455.385s">and</a> we don't like what you're doing, so we're gonna take a look at your permit and see if we can put some restrictions on it to safeguard the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2461.187s">This</a> has been an ongoing issue since I got on the council, between Budweiser and BJ's, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2466.809s">Tough</a> neighbors, you know, large employers in this community, valuable neighbors, you know, bring some good to the community, no doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2473.791s">But</a> you have to live there, I don't, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2475.131s">And</a> you know, I know where you live, I know where your house is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2478.012s">It's</a> not a little tiny little street, you know what I mean?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2489.145s">Well,</a> when it's warm, if you don't wanna go and use your pool, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2494.669s">And</a> I don't care about those crummy old men over there with their beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2497.831s">I'll</a> watch them and they watch me. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2503.635s">No,</a> I think that the best bet would be to see if we can call the brass in for BJ. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2507.377s">We've</a> tried this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2508.858s">I</a> mean, ultimately, I don't think it's gonna help situations that we are right now in the middle of litigation with BJs because we didn't want them to put a gas station in. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2517.418s">So</a> there's a lot of moving parts going on with that location, but I think that the special permit might be the best way to attack it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2778.79s">I</a> think it is important to point out, though, that this is really a function of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2783.935s">I</a> remember when Mike McGlynn was the mayor, he'd get in his car and drive down there and say, I want to meet with the general manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2788.278s">He</a> wouldn't pick up the phone and call him. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2789.639s">He'd</a> say, this is what I want done, and go down there to meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2791.941s">If</a> you're not getting that type of service, you're not getting that type of service, and we'll do all that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2795.585s">But</a> ultimately, this is an enforcement issue, not a legislative issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2799.848s">So</a> the administration has to buy into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2802.13s">And</a> if the administration wants to see it stop, then they have to send their people down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2805.833s">They</a> have to send code enforcement down there and they have to hold VJs accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2809.215s">This</a> council can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2810.516s">We</a> can call them to the meetings and we can try to work on the permits that fall under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2815.098s">But</a> when it comes to the day-to-day operations of the community and code enforcement, that's a department that falls under the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2820.841s">for</a> an administrative branch and executive branch department, the mayor has to get them down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2826.425s">And</a> we can ask until we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2827.966s">But</a> if a track record of asking is any indication as to what the administration is going to do, this is going to go on a file like this big right here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2834.251s">And</a> we're not going to we're not going to hear back because that's historically what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2837.894s">We've</a> talked <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2838.294s">about</a> it all day today in our previous meetings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2841.597s">We</a> had a subcommittee meeting today to talk about two pieces of draft ordinances that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2847.123s">The</a> first one was offered in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2848.985s">It</a> was a two-sentence draft ordinance that needed review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2852.369s">The</a> administration didn't get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2853.61s">us.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2854.09s">The</a> second item was offered in 2020 was a little bit more involved but again the administration still hasn't responded to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2859.791s">So</a> these are items that this council is asking for for us to create legislation in this community, and we're not getting any, any cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2868.473s">So</a> my advice to you would be also to be sure to stay on the administration and let them know your level of dissatisfaction, because they're really the only ones that can solve this <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2882.363s">We're</a> ready to fight with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.344s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2883.764s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2884.684s">And</a> use as much authority and power that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2887.126s">However,</a> that scope and authority is limited under the purview of our responsibilities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2893.709s">Exactly.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2896.131s">It's</a> a great quiet street. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2897.492s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=2899.313s">Only</a> one way in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3031.941s">So</a> Rita, does this mean you're not going to go to the celebration on the completion of the Medford square meter project ice cream truck that the mayor wants to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3045.323s">I</a> agree with you, and I know Councilor Carvialo and I had spoke on this, and Ricky was telling me how involved he was in working with Faye and the administration to get those taken out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3056.446s">It</a> seems like the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3061.888s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3166.631s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3170.813s">Yes,</a> Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3175.656s">Back</a> in FY21, when we looked at the $6 million structural deficit that we had, and then again in FY22, when we looked at the $12 million structural deficit that we have in FY23, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3193.79s">When</a> we look at the old $700 million or so dollar structural deficit that we have, one of the things that I made very clear during the budget discussions was that we're not going to use the parking program to generate revenues and fill our budget shortfalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3208.986s">And</a> I feel like that's what's happening, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3211.088s">We're</a> expanding the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3212.25s">Now,</a> three weeks, three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row, four meetings in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3215.893s">We've</a> had talk about parking right talk about parking talk about failures in the parking department, ticketing people but not supposed to get tickets going down the wrong street and giving everybody on the same street a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3226.338s">Now</a> the expansion of meters into residential neighborhoods the expansion of meters in front of churches and places of worship and schools and funeral homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3234.321s">All</a> right, it seems to me like we're trying to use this parking program to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3239.462s">to</a> address the structural shortfall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3267.907s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3268.707s">And,</a> you know, the packing program when first initiated and first implemented was to turn over spots in the business districts and to enforce residential packing in neighborhoods that were budding public transportation areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3280.898s">that's</a> expanded now into ninjas jumping out of trees and giving you tickets on if you're facing the wrong way if you don't have an inspection sticker if you have an expired sticker on your license plate uh you know it's it's getting it's getting a little out of hand yet um we get the residents on brook street that have been never-ending problem that's not going to be rectified anytime soon um parking still comes and gives them tickets um there's really no <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3308.572s">And</a> there's been no dynamic amendment of any of these policy decisions that have been made to satisfy any of our constituency. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3315.696s">And</a> it just seems to me like the reoccurring theme, if you agree, it's great, we'll hug. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3323.059s">If</a> you disagree, it's gonna fall on deaf ears and no one's gonna talk to you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3607.067s">I'm</a> pretty sure George Bernoski is like the media repairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3615.452s">I</a> think his title is like supervisor of media repair or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3618.834s">I</a> don't think he has any type of function that has to do with the supervision or the issuance of tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3623.056s">I</a> think he's more of a <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3625.418s">a</a> meter fixer, oversees the meter repair program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=3629.18s">If</a> it's my recollection, I remember when the mayor put out one of her many emails about her new hires that she classified.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5236.384s">Council</a> request that pavement restoration be done in a curb-to-curb fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5245.731s">Oh,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5254.348s">Well,</a> I mean, it's a question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5297.653s">So</a> it says that this is a, what, a replacement project? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5300.834s">A</a> relocation project? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5301.795s">They're</a> relocating the gas main on Walnut Street, why?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5321.358s">You're</a> off right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5322.879s">Similar</a> to the work necessary on Riverside Ave, sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5328.424s">Well,</a> you guys don't necessarily want to do this, but they have to do water works. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5331.206s">Are</a> you going to get out of the way?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5354.36s">That's</a> a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5356.041s">So</a> is the restoration going to be done curb to curb, or is it going to be one of these six inch trenches out to the middle of a street that in six months is going to fall apart and turn this into 600 feet of potholes?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5402.149s">Does</a> this have anything to do with the loan order that we just passed? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5406.434s">No,</a> no, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5407.815s">We</a> have it as a city engineer available.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5428.068s">Cuddy,</a> this is no reflection on the job you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5430.57s">It's</a> more of a reflection on the information that the administration provides us when they put these papers on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5435.712s">So,</a> you know, here we are this evening and we're, you know, expected to vote for seven football fields worth of ground getting torn up and we have nobody here from the city engineers <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5449.593s">restoration</a> is going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5450.953s">And</a> I'm not comfortable going into a neighborhood and tearing up, you know, 700, 800 feet worth of street, turning the neighborhood upside down and then not knowing what the final product is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5460.616s">So</a> I apologize for having to sit through this meeting this evening, but I'm without further information from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5466.297s">I'm</a> not very comfortable proceeding in any other fashion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5510.297s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5512.178s">Quite</a> frequently I get calls, especially surrounding some of these car repair facilities automobile repair facilities along Mr. Avenue, relative to the amount of footprint that vehicles take up. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5525.707s">And</a> also the parking of vehicles that they're servicing on public roads in public parking spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5533.313s">So,</a> one thing I've noticed is every time we get a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5537.255s">application</a> before us that the traffic commission has to sign off saying that there'll be no traffic impact, but they failed to look at parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5545.158s">They</a> failed to look at the parking impact of this proposed business. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5547.638s">So</a> this proposed service might create. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5550.639s">So</a> what I'm asking is that the administration revamp the criteria in establishing these reviews to also take into consideration the parking impacts so that we have a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5561.123s">We</a> vote for something, what the parking impacts are as well as the traffic impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5565.882s">much</a> to ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5566.543s">I</a> think the administration could do a parking assessment or even maybe establish a certain criteria that would say the sex amount of parking spots per square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5574.671s">And</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5575.191s">Very</a> similar to what we have in our zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5578.535s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, what we're seeing, especially if you go down ST James Avenue and some of those streets off of Mystic Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5585.221s">is</a> that every single parking spot is taken up by vehicles all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5588.324s">Then</a> six o'clock comes, the sidewalk rolls up and all those guys disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5592.248s">Then</a> six o'clock in the morning, all those cars are back there again, but they're not people working. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5596.092s">Those</a> are cars that are being worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5597.273s">They're</a> being moved in and out of garages and being put in the street and being put back in the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5601.217s">All</a> right, well, it's a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5602.418s">Those</a> parking spots are also necessary for other businesses to utilize. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5605.441s">They</a> should be turned over. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5606.422s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5615.524s">But</a> ultimately, I think this is something that needs to be looked at, because it does certainly have an impact on, number one, public safety, and number two, our ability to turn over pockets and generate business for business owners and business storefronts in the downtown area.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5771.363s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5772.684s">This</a> is an ongoing situation up on Fulton Spring Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5776.046s">If</a> you know where Mr. Falco lives, look down the street about four or five houses and you'll see that there's a situation down there where <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5784.528s">The</a> pitch of the underground infrastructure for sewage is not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5788.993s">And</a> this goes back now, several years, one of the homeowners there reached out to the DPW had representatives from the water department come up and take a look at what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5800.025s">The</a> solution that the water department came up with at that time was, are you going to have to jack your house up eight inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5806.174s">So</a> the gentleman went, invested $200,000, jacked up his house eight inches, and the day that they pulled the bulldozers away, he had another sewage backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5816.259s">The</a> city engineer, DPW commissioner have been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5820.662s">They've</a> looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5821.362s">What</a> they've been able to determine is that in a quote, I believe things are all screwy under there would be the very technical term that was used, but the pipes, there's a water pipe that goes over sewer pipe that goes under a gas pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5834.971s">There's</a> a big problem, but this homeowner spent a ton of dough at the direction <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5841.993s">about</a> water and sewer department saying that if you jack your house up, you won't have to deal with this backflow issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5849.775s">They</a> spent the money, they jacked the house up and they're still dealing with the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5854.376s">The</a> DPW commissioner is well aware of the situation and I've been assured that he's working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5859.517s">I</a> actually met with the residential homeowner this evening before I came to this meeting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5865.438s">I'd</a> like to withdraw this matter at this point in time and give the DPW commissioner an opportunity to continue to do <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5876.54s">come</a> up to a significant and satisfactory remedy for our bodies involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5880.463s">So</a> I will be withdrawing this at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=5882.464s">But</a> I did want to just give a preface as to what this was all about, because I'm sure that would raise a lot of curiosity based upon the language of the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6947.699s">I</a> mean, that's not a paid holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6950.201s">That</a> is losing her touch.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=6966.834s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7578.892s">Well,</a> I'll delay that then if we have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7581.394s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7584.242s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7585.523s">I'm</a> somewhat familiar with flex car and flex hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7590.107s">One</a> of the questions I have is this rental car is this going to be a rental car that's used for when they say drivers, you know, I keep thinking picturing driver like a Lyft driver in the Lyft driver works for Lyft and then they rent the vehicle through Lyft to use to provide the Lyft service to consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7606.501s">Or</a> is this where these are just going to be rental cars that <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7609.464s">The</a> driver is me, and I want to rent the car and I can just go through flex lift to get the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7614.971s">Can</a> she explain clarify that for me please. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7617.995s">Yeah,</a> absolutely.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7672.722s">So</a> ultimately it's somewhat like we have a post office over here and the post office has trucks and the employees of the post office use the trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7684.049s">And</a> this is the same thing, the employees of Lyft would use the Lyft, the FlexLyft vehicles to perform the functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7690.555s">Now,</a> that's assuming that they don't have cars, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7694.198s">Are</a> they going to be authorized to park vehicles there all day while they take these FlexCars out? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7699.723s">Or</a> are you saying that they're more long term than short term? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7703.166s">So</a> I just, I think part of the concern that we're hearing from my colleague is that it's heavily congested. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7710.103s">heavily</a> congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7712.144s">And</a> because of that, there are some public safety concerns that coupled with the fact that there's some issues with the garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7720.326s">The</a> excise tax, I think, was a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7722.026s">That</a> makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7723.126s">The</a> business is going to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7724.087s">The</a> vehicle should be garaged here so the city can offset the damages to our infrastructure with the funds that we generate. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7731.688s">But</a> I certainly support the gentleman's motion to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7736.41s">In</a> fact, we need to go back to the table <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7740.535s">a</a> little bit closer to an understanding of what this program is. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7745.137s">I</a> personally have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7747.938s">I</a> think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7748.739s">I</a> would make some recommendations that, you know, the special permit go with the business and not with the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7755.221s">Do</a> a 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7756.962s">But</a> as of right now, it doesn't feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7770.685s">I</a> think Lift Hub has been a pretty good neighbor in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7776.607s">They've</a> been pretty open with us when they came to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7780.109s">They</a> let us know they were coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7781.529s">They</a> invited us to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7782.83s">They've</a> always been visible and available to speak with anybody from government that has any concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7787.992s">So</a> I certainly don't have an issue with their business model or the way they run their business, but the quality of life stuff and the neighborhood stuff do <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7801.748s">some</a> of the entities that the larger businesses that are residential property. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7805.71s">So</a> that stuff needs to be put into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7811.032s">So</a> I would second gentleman's motion to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7816.095s">Should</a> he reintroduce it in an effort for us to come to some common ground and see if we can figure this one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=7822.498s">Because</a> I think Lyft is a good employer to have here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8162.227s">If</a> they work the hours, they can make the money, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8353.486s">I</a> just have a couple of more questions to a friend of sunny California might not be sunny there anymore at 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8360.369s">But</a> what are the requirements to be a Lyft driver in Massachusetts, where you need a driver's license in a vehicle right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8384.999s">Okay,</a> and if I have a driver's license, but I don't have a vehicle, can I be a Lyft driver?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8413.039s">Excellent,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8413.679s">So</a> ultimately, this also gives people who don't have the <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8418.809s">driver's</a> license, the opportunity to get a job and work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8422.633s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8423.154s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8423.394s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8424.695s">I</a> would again suggest so I there's no one else to speak.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8647.341s">I</a> missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8648.962s">Can</a> you say what this was for again?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8659.73s">to</a> have an ice cream to celebrate Paca Minas. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8663.183s">Councilor</a> Newton. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8664.844s">I'm</a> just trying to figure this out because this sounds like the most tone deaf proposal I have ever witnessed by this administration to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8673.088s">After</a> the last four weeks, the last month and a half, six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8678.97s">You</a> tell me how many months we've been talking about parking and what's going on with parking and how terrible the program is and how many failures have been with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=8686.654s">And</a> we're going to have an ice cream social to celebrate these failures?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10058.022s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10058.222s">We</a> can still put the restrictions on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10505.222s">Does</a> anybody ever notice that anytime anything goes wrong in the parking department, it's always somebody else's fault and not the parking department's? <a href="https://youtu.be/80br4JUepho&t=10515.106s">Or</a> is it just me picking that up?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_1XcCTX46SCo/2024-11-19_1XcCTX46SCo.html">City Council 09-27-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=373.747s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=375.207s">Bill</a> Carr was a great Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=378.112s">pillar</a> of the community, father and grandfather, teacher, coach, community activist, good elk, a member of Post 45, American Legion, veteran, served his country and this community well, some that I have fond memories of that will sadly be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=394.603s">It's</a> all too often that we're up here celebrating people and the achievements and contributions that they make to our community after their passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=404.576s">And</a> this is one of those instances where I think we should have taken an opportunity to look at the contributions that Mr. Carr had made to this community and maybe had the chance to honour him while he was still with us because he is someone that certainly has made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of families in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1301.034s">I</a> find this very troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1303.196s">So</a> we have an IT department with no IT director or assistant IT director. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1310.502s">We</a> have a law department with no solicitor or assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1316.707s">We</a> have an assessor's department, no assessor or assistant city assessor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1332.624s">I'm</a> not sure if we have an elections coordinator or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1335.026s">I've</a> heard various mumblings throughout the community that the moment that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1340.309s">Gale</a> was taken from her office, they had somebody filling her shoes with a higher salary.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1439.95s">It's</a> very frustrating to come here week in and week out and make recommendations on how we can improve the way that we deliver the most basic of city services and have it fall on deaf ears.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1459.883s">From</a> the sounds of it, as Councilor Bears said, there was a serious problem going on there that had to result in the termination of an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1467.683s">That</a> position was never filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1469.984s">So</a> were these problems ever remedied? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=1472.806s">What</a> is going on?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2216.302s">Um,</a> I think what we need to do is stop the bleeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2219.464s">And</a> councilor Caraviello is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2221.025s">We</a> need to stop issuing tickets for resident permit parking until mentioned or a mentioned parking department or whatever they go by these days can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2231.873s">Um,</a> ultimately this is a department that never should have been absorbed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2238.077s">You</a> don't have the capacity to run a parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2241.119s">We're</a> proving that daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2243.221s">We</a> went from having a vendor that wrote us a check. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2246.738s">to</a> a department that's come here before us now for over $800,000 in initial appropriations, and then another $200,000 or $300,000 in supplemental spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2257.506s">We're</a> still not getting any satisfaction.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2268.774s">Now,</a> we talk about reports, and we talk about committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2271.776s">Forget</a> the reports, and forget the committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2273.317s">It's</a> time to use common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2275.577s">When</a> we talked about taking parking enforcement and doing it in-house, a committee was put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2282.66s">That</a> committee came before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2284.74s">And</a> we spoke to that committee, and we said, please talk to us about resident parking, resident parking enforcement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2309.007s">When</a> I say stop the bleeding, it's not just the tickets that are getting written. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2311.808s">What</a> about non-renewals to the registries? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2313.909s">What</a> about non-renewals for your license? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2315.51s">What</a> about non-renewals for your registration? <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2317.391s">Because</a> of unpaid tickets that were issued unjustly that you can't get a remedy for here in City Hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2332.438s">That's</a> what the parking program was established for, to put the residents first. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2336.34s">And</a> we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2338.268s">When</a> we looked at, as Councilor Scarpelli said, the history of parking enforcement in Medford and why this program came to fruition, it was to turn over spots in the business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2347.815s">That's</a> what it was initially proposed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2351.537s">It</a> wasn't to go into the neighborhoods, to go down Sylvia Road, a dead end street, and give people tickets when they've been able to police themselves and have no parking complaints for 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2364.573s">It</a> doesn't make sense to me that the Metro parking department is driving down Wellington Road when Wellington Road hasn't complained about a parking issue in 25 years, but the residents of Goldsmith Ave have been going on C-Click fix for the last six months and asking for relief and no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2382.365s">It</a> just doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2384.066s">We</a> have problem areas that are being identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2386.949s">through</a> these tools and modules that the mayor has touted as being so effective in the delivery of city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2393.794s">But</a> then we're not using the data that we're collecting from these modules to make decisions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2426.3s">I</a> know that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2429.733s">Hispanic</a> Heritage Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2430.694s">It's</a> also today's national no excuse day. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2434.356s">So</a> I hope someone from the administration is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2436.717s">Madam</a> President, if they can bring that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2438.138s">I</a> do not see anyone.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2760.366s">Madam</a> President, I just, I do want to point out that these failures are really managerial failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2765.47s">And,</a> you know, when we talk about the human resource problems that we have there in our community and the human resource crisis that's going on here in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2774.428s">In</a> our packets this evening when we got here, we have charges, additional charges that were brought forward by local 25 who represent our parking enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2785.253s">And</a> it appears to me that the administration's not exactly treating them in the kind of fashion as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2792.377s">Tracking</a> devices and cameras, randomly changing our, randomly changing schedules from night to day and day to night. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2799.54s">I</a> mean, imagine having a family and having your schedule randomly changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=2802.161s">Next</a> week you're working nights, sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4144.077s">That's</a> an expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4148.801s">I</a> will say this, that when we implemented the parking program initially, what we saw was an increase in the local meals tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4163.127s">which</a> showed that there was a problem, and that those spots weren't turning over. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4166.429s">And</a> with the enforcement, those spots did start to turn over. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4169.291s">And</a> then what we saw was actually enhanced growth and enhanced revenue in our business districts through the local meals tax, because those parking spots were turning over, those restaurants were selling more product, and in turn, we were getting more money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=4771.981s">Well,</a> every signature's on it, so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5969.779s">Thank</a> you, Mr. So maybe you could explain to us what the role of the building commissioner is in the community and what role the building commissioner plays because it's my understanding that any zoning question <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5981.752s">and</a> the city goes to the building commission, and the building commission is the one that makes the determination as to how those zoning decisions are made in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5988.337s">And</a> we all know what a crucial role zoning plays in our ability to generate new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=5993.461s">And</a> when we're sitting here, beating our chest after $49 million of deficit spending over the last three years, and no revenue generation plan, it might make sense for us to prioritize this position, because ultimately the building commissioner is someone that does help generate revenues through permits and fees, <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6011.493s">and</a> through rulings on zoning, as well as oversight of the code enforcement office, which is something that we all have had talks and discussions about in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6020.076s">Thank</a> you, Mary.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6321.924s">And</a> I guess all I'm challenging is that... I think it was brought up through an official channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6326.288s">I</a> think the gentleman asked the mayor, right to her face, in negotiations, and she asked the team, right, in negotiations, and they haven't answered the question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6334.476s">One</a> way or the other.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6410.727s">And</a> I agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6411.347s">I</a> mean, ultimately, especially what we're seeing in the committee trend right now is I don't want to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6417.512s">So</a> put a committee together and have them do it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6419.954s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6420.294s">I</a> don't want to make an unpopular decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6421.915s">So</a> I'm going to put a group of people together to make an unpopular decision and say, don't blame me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6426.138s">That's</a> what they said to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6428.92s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6429.201s">It's</a> a leadership issue, really, is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6431.522s">It's</a> a leadership issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6586.014s">Point</a> of information, Madam President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6589.774s">Also,</a> it's important to remember, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6592.135s">Brown,</a> that some of these <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6594.967s">committees</a> and boards are statutory and when you not necessarily backed by ordinance but but enabled through state law and in the majority of those circumstances and situations a residency requirement is outlined for example of a malcommissioned Brooks Commission the Brooks the Brooks Bar <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6620.888s">and</a> the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6621.869s">So</a> it's important to remember that there's also state statute that covers and dictates a lot of the stuff that our ordinances support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1XcCTX46SCo&t=6675.218s">As</a> the authority through a regulatory action to establish the protocols and criteria for which a member of a board of commission under her purview would be fit, residency can be one of those selective criteria that she uses.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_M203rzS4cvE/2024-10-05_M203rzS4cvE.html">City Council 09-13-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=573.124s">Madam</a> President, if you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=573.905s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=575.694s">I</a> think this administration's been very clear about its approach to labor relations in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=584.062s">Quite</a> frankly, we've seen personnel turnover, more frequently than the rooms at the Hyatt across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=590.388s">All</a> right, there's a human resource nightmare going on here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=593.611s">It's</a> an absolute nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=602.722s">A</a> couple months ago, we had a representative from local 25 here before us that showed us a package of 40 somewhat various labor charges, grievances, lawsuits that are pending before the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=616.889s">So</a> it brought to my attention that yet another employee has been removed from city hall by escort. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=624.773s">That's</a> not the way you treat employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=627.374s">If</a> you respect your employees, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=629.438s">You</a> work with them, not against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=631.118s">And</a> I feel as though this administration has worked against a lot of the employees in this community as of recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=640.101s">How</a> much money did they spend investigating rumors on a DPW employee? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=645.342s">How</a> much money we've spent reinvestigating and rehashing the Brady List issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=650.823s">On</a> and on again, it's more about press releases than results. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=654.044s">On</a> and on again, it seems to me that the work that you people do is not respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=659.063s">On</a> and on again, it seems to me that three years without a raise, three and a half years without a raise, while other bargaining units are settling and getting raises, tells us something. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=669.042s">It</a> tells us something, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=671.773s">I</a> appreciate the work that you guys do Amy, I worked with you, I was a bargaining rep for your union at one point in time, I think I did better than 74 cents an hour to I hope Jesus.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=683.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=685.744s">So,</a> in looking at this and the approach that's going forward I mean ultimately the city council doesn't have the ability to tell the mayor to give you more money, but we can stand with you in lockstep and say that this is a good fight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=710.115s">And</a> I don't think you have the luxury of closing your door and telling people that you're too busy to meet with them either. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=717.597s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=718.477s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=718.957s">When</a> the general public walks in off the street, you guys don't have the ability to turn them away. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=723.158s">But</a> when you guys have concerns and issues that you want to address, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=726.267s">The</a> door's not open for you to address those issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=729.208s">I,</a> as one Councilor, appreciate the work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=730.908s">I</a> know that the city's only as successful as the work that you do and the commitment that you have to being a part of this team. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=735.79s">It's</a> a two-way street, and the administration has to show some of that respect and responsibility as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=742.632s">Moving</a> forward, I certainly would never, ever, ever stand in the way of a contract race, a negotiated contract race that the union and the administration have been able to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=753.756s">But</a> it seems to me that right now negotiation is not the approach administration wants to take we're seeing what's going on at the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=759.902s">My</a> teachers have been the impasse has been declared and the teachers contracts negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=764.707s">That's</a> one of the larger bargaining units that we have here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=774.93s">The</a> work in this community that, you know, I send my two children to the public schools that sit there with these public employees for more hours of the day than they spend with me awake, right, when you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=786.256s">So</a> the investment that we're making in our employees here, the investment that we're making in retention of those employees that have that institutional knowledge is laughable. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=796.262s">We're</a> losing good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=798.103s">More</a> and more, we're seeing good people being walked out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=801.404s">More</a> and more, we're seeing good people saying, I've had enough, I can't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=805.123s">And</a> they're moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=806.583s">And</a> the only people that are suffering because of that are the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=812.645s">I</a> appreciate you guys in the fight that you're putting up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=815.806s">It's</a> a good fight, it's a fight worth fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=818.066s">And</a> I'll stand with you every step of the way to ensure that the administration takes the appropriate steps to show value for the work that you do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4013.135s">And</a> I do find it curious, Madam President, when we take a look at this agenda this evening, papers from the administration, and we'll see that they're trying to upgrade a position in the Community Development Department, but we have created a new position, upgrading the existing position from the land use planner to a senior planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4032.164s">Non-union</a> role, we've seen more and more requests for non-union positions to get pay raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4037.586s">More</a> and more requests for non-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4039.572s">positions</a> to be reclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4041.553s">We</a> still have the issue of our human resource director working out of grade now for the better part of two and a half years and not being required to pay back any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4052.416s">Not</a> being paid back any money to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4054.777s">So</a> we have a human resource director who's being paid out of grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4058.178s">This</a> council voted down, voted down the reclassification of the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4063.879s">Gentleman's</a> still being paid between $69,000, I think more than what his initial salary was as diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4070.714s">And</a> here we are with teachers educators in this community, fighting for a pittance 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4078.483s">So</a> what's that 35 bucks a week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4572.732s">I</a> don't understand the message that you're trying to send. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4574.533s">So</a> you have a group of 500 teachers that you're negotiating with and you're going to the labor board and you're saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4580.595s">We</a> reached an impasse which really means we don't want to negotiate anymore we're walking from the table but then at the same breath is saying we do want to negotiate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4600.493s">Right,</a> so now we're in a situation where we have <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4602.795s">other</a> bargaining units that are receiving a cost of living adjustment right which is really just a cost of living adjustment to combat inflation at the battle inflation right so now we have units that have settled contracts at two percent and now we're giving cost of living adjustments at a different rate to other employees so it kind of sends a message of value the work of some more than others and that the impact on the economic factors that are happening around all of us um <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4629.775s">don't</a> impact those traffic supervisors, for example, or those school nurses in the same fashion that they would impact the school teacher.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5274.82s">Listen,</a> we sit here and talk about craziest stuff for all night long about stuff that doesn't even matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5280.144s">This</a> is something that's very important to the lives of at least 500 people that reside in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5286.649s">That's</a> okay, but it is what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5288.41s">I</a> mean, we got to do with this, what we're here for, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5290.452s">We</a> voted to go bi-weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5291.452s">We're</a> going to have to deal with some long meetings sometimes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5299.158s">I</a> just want to get to the city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5300.839s">I'm</a> happy to revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5302.28s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5302.861s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5303.241s">We</a> suspended the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5304.081s">We</a> didn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5304.722s">We</a> voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5305.563s">We're</a> in the situation we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5307.884s">You</a> know, when listening to what Mr. Murphy said about the most recent package being better than the last three collective bargaining agreements, I've been around a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5317.811s">And</a> you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5319.512s">Maybe</a> the employees took less back then, but we didn't hear him complain because they felt a lot more appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5324.977s">And</a> I think that that's really a reoccurring theme that I'm feeling and that I'm hearing across many departments here in the city, but the school department's not exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5334.046s">So</a> when we sit here and we talk about the filing for an impasse as a way for us to move closer to a settlement, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5342.373s">In</a> my opinion, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5343.274s">It</a> sounds more to me like the administration just trying to control the narrative and the public perception as to what's going on than <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5350.861s">actual</a> progress towards a settlement and really sounds just like a counter to the June budget job action that was taken and the job actions that are being taken now because the union's being publicly vocal about their position and the way that they feel to be treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5367.735s">With</a> that being said, Madam President, it sounds to me like you want to move on, so I'd be happy to rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5381.484s">It's</a> important to point out that the city staff is being paid to be here, and these people are here on their own, free will and volition as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5386.967s">I</a> just want that to be clear.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6712.979s">Madam</a> President, motion to table until such time as the overwhelmingly large and looming labor relations problems that we have in this community can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6721.4s">I</a> don't think it's time to create another position. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6723.321s">We</a> didn't have another position that's gonna cost us more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6726.041s">We</a> didn't have another position that's gonna cost us more money that's being created 60 days after the passage of the budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6824.284s">Well,</a> if legal, whatever, get back to us and answer our underlying and initial question, I'm sure that we'd be able to answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6829.169s">But</a> as of right now, it's been almost about a year and we still haven't received that information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6914.431s">I</a> stand with the workers that were before us here this evening and reintroduce my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6917.672s">I</a> don't feel as though we should be creating positions two months after the budget passed, after we've talked about how we have no revenues, about how we had to sit here and fight tooth and nail for what we asked for for eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6927.934s">And</a> now all of a sudden we have more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6929.914s">We</a> have more money to create a new position, but we don't have more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6933.478s">on</a> cost of living adjustments that are recordable across the board for our school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6938.48s">And</a> we have eight collective bargaining agreements that right now are at an impasse or not being negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6944.862s">And</a> quite frankly, these contracts that are expired, they expired quite some time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6948.783s">So</a> once they get settled, they're just going to expire again and they're going to be right back at the table in the next six to eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6953.725s">So</a> with that being said, I reintroduce my motion to have this matter tabled until the labor relations dispute and the contracts are settled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7006.686s">Madam</a> President, I asked for a ruling from the chairs that how many votes it takes to pass this calf, and whether or not chapter 44 twice, and I don't really know Zach's reading it for you know what, almost as good as what we have which is no lawyer but
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7094.255s">I</a> do believe in June we discussed that with the mayor and we were talking about the budget, that document that you know sets up the spending for the next fiscal year which we're in now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7106.639s">That</a> document, we talked about having an assistant city solicitor position to the city council, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7112.32s">And</a> the mayor came back to this council and made a compromise and said, yeah, if you vote for my budget, I'm gonna give you guys that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7118.903s">And</a> it's gonna be posted in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7121.324s">And</a> it's September and we don't even have a regular city solicitor, nevermind an assistant city solicitor for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7126.866s">We</a> have legal questions that have been looming for nine months that haven't been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7130.547s">We</a> can talk about this stuff, so we're blue in the face. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7132.928s">It's</a> an irresponsible vote to take right now without the response from the city solicitor that we asked for nine months ago.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=7172.953s">This</a> is crazy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8080.789s">Motion</a> to waive the remainder of the readings and have this matter be passed upon vote of this council this evening, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8086.39s">It</a> will save us the trouble of having to go through advertising. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8089.691s">It</a> will save us the trouble of having to bring this paper back for a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8093.712s">We've</a> had two meetings on it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8095.072s">It's</a> a 0% interest loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8096.992s">It's</a> a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8097.653s">It</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8098.213s">It's</a> necessary for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8099.513s">And</a> I think we've been able to establish that through the two meetings that we've had previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8103.214s">I</a> would second that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8361.482s">being</a> a young father and having the opportunity to take my kids down to the public schools, my kids are at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8367.95s">And</a> just seeing the work and effort that they put in down there, they do an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8371.873s">These</a> traffic supervisors are really underappreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8375.895s">Nothing's</a> worse than when one of them's out and they have a uniformed police officer doing the traffic detail down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8382.88s">They</a> have it down to a system that the traffic supervisors where it just flows amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8387.683s">And</a> any disruption to that usually creates chaos down in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8391.506s">But</a> I'd like to just thank the <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8393.342s">the</a> traffic supervisors that we have here in the community for doing such a great job, because they are an underappreciated resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8399.446s">They're</a> the people that we trust in keeping our kids safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8402.548s">We've</a> seen a number of tragic incidents over the years with traffic supervisors being assaulted, being yelled at, spit on, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=8409.533s">So</a> I'd like to just make sure that they recognize the value that they have in this community.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_xyqJQrsXvc0/2024-11-18_xyqJQrsXvc0.html">City Council 08-09-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=293.408s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=294.949s">Just</a> last month, Donald and Mary Bonner celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in Aruba, surrounded by their five. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=304.1s">digits</a> were the grandchildren down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=307.143s">Mary</a> Bonner was a traffic supervisor here in the city of Metro for a long time her husband Donald, a local auto body repairman, but they grew up on, they live on Hastings road lifelong Metro presidents, great people, great figures in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=320.318s">That</a> was one of the houses in the neighborhood we could always. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=323.361s">walk</a> into the backyard, take a dip in the pool, get a drink off the hose, and use the bathroom if there's ever an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=328.344s">A</a> very welcoming family. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=329.625s">They</a> touch the lives of many in this community, and it's great to see them celebrate 50 years of wedded bliss. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=333.767s">I</a> hope we can all be so lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=335.629s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I ask my council colleagues in joining me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion and also requesting the city clerk provide them with a citation doing the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=509.866s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=511.148s">My</a> two had the good opportunity of attending high school with Kimberly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=514.21s">I've</a> known her for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=515.291s">She's</a> a great person, very hard worker and someone that was very dedicated to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=519.595s">Her</a> presence in that law office is going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=522.478s">I've</a> always found her to be someone that had the utmost of integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=525.577s">and</a> someone that came to work prepared every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=528.44s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I hate to see her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=531.302s">She's</a> a very close friend and someone I respect very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=533.965s">So</a> congratulations, Kim. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=535.266s">Wish</a> you all the best in your future endeavors and hopefully you'll be able to help as many people as you have in a new job as you have in the past.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=810.175s">Any</a> Councilors, Madam President, just money papers come from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=814.959s">Historically,</a> there was conversation relative to the construction or reconstruction of the <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=820.288s">At</a> that point in time, I don't think the mayor was too supportive of that paper or that initiative or endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=825.369s">Presently,</a> we're looking at a financial situation here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=828.27s">We're</a> looking at, what, $29 million in deficit spending over the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=833.972s">So</a> from a financial standpoint, I think we're not in a great position right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=840.053s">The</a> certain funds that were out there were available to us, whether or not they're still available to us is a whole different ball of wax and a whole different question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=846.254s">I</a> know that there was several million dollars that was dedicated to this community through the federal government's transportation bond bill, and I know that there was several million dollars dedicated to this community from the state's transportation bond bill in order to get those funds released. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=857.277s">It'd</a> have to be an act of Congress, literally, and also an act of the governor at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=863.028s">It's</a> certainly a worthwhile endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=864.81s">I</a> know that we have some concerns about the traffic management in this community and the parking management in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=869.074s">Councilor</a> Caraviello has a resolution on, coming up a little later, whether or not we have the capacity to handle this type of stuff, whether or not it's a good idea for the city to be in the business of parking, whether or not we should outsource it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=879.283s">We</a> looked at having outsourced parking in the previous administrations and <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=883.687s">seem</a> to generate revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=885.027s">Now</a> we seem to be spending quite a bit of money and not getting anything back and not getting a return on our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=890.489s">That</a> coupled with a lot of the confusion that we're seeing in the neighborhoods related to tickets, appeals processes, being pushed to outside court for a day in court, filing fees and the like is creating a situation over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=906.035s">I</a> certainly support anything that will bring business to our communities and revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=911.358s">We've</a> only been talking about that since the 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=913.66s">So,</a> you know, if anything will help, I think it would be if I could graduate in conjunction with the work that we're doing at Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=919.443s">But</a> I think we need a bit of a private partnership and a commitment in order to do that, as well as a commitment from the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1038.6s">On</a> that note, Madam President, if you look at the recodified zoning ordinance, what the council did was allow for the opportunity, for instance, is where we can have public-private partnerships and entities like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1047.526s">We</a> have shared parking changes in our zoning ordinance, which allows an entity to have parking during the day for business and parking at night for residential or other uses, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1056.672s">So</a> I think that that's something that we've really set the stage for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1059.994s">It's</a> just a matter of putting a plan together and executing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1062.315s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1062.816s">The</a> availability is there and the opportunity as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1066.258s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1581.317s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1583.973s">Madam</a> President, ultimately, a convictual license is a license to sell food. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1588.601s">By</a> ordinance, we require the breweries to sell food. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1591.126s">So</a> this is a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=1592.929s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2270.772s">And</a> again, let's say, you're right-handed to have an irrigation system, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2273.873s">You</a> can't just water your lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2275.073s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2275.773s">So</a> you'd have to put a $5,000 or $6,000 investment into your front lawn in order to get the benefit of the- That's the current rule, yes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2362.18s">A</a> couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2363.922s">I</a> don't think either one of you gentlemen, we had the last time that we went through a meter replacement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2379.695s">There</a> was quite a bit of, I guess, problems surrounding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2384.039s">Now,</a> listen, I understand we need to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2387.081s">I</a> understand that we're getting 7.8 million bucks for free pretty much, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2391.324s">I</a> mean, we just have to pay it back, but we're getting it at 0%. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2396.197s">What's</a> the plan to make sure that what happened last time doesn't happen again when we go through this process?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2407.863s">Why</a> don't we just explain that, what some of the big problems with the first go around.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2421.01s">And</a> the reason for estimations was because of outdated equipment that was given less than accurate readings?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2484.21s">Leak</a> detection.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2517.679s">So</a> last time, I think part of the problem that we ran into was that there was a lot of inaction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2521.182s">We</a> didn't make up our minds as to what we wanted to do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2523.163s">And</a> then we fell into a spot where the meters were at the spot where they needed to be done and they needed to be done immediately.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2528.808s">And</a> we're not at that spot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2531.253s">with</a> some assurances that if we get this project done and we do it in a timely fashion, that we won't run into the same problems that we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2538.516s">With</a> the lifespan of the new meters, we're taking out a $7.8 million loan that's going to be paid back over 10 years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2577.963s">And</a> then we're going to pay the loan off in 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2579.244s">So</a> we're going to get 10 years for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2580.724s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2603.067s">The</a> paper that's before us this evening is nothing more than an informational paper, if I'm not understanding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2607.169s">Maybe</a> that's what it looks like, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2617.552s">Has</a> the city applied for the loan and have they been deemed eligible for the loan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2637.97s">That's</a> my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2639.01s">So</a> we need to approve you to put the application in?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2645.692s">I</a> can see why, because they're not going to give you the money and then have you come back here and then us not approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2649.994s">That</a> would make sense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2699.534s">And</a> if you guys have any further questions for us, you know, we'll come and answer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2704.436s">Can</a> we just offer that in the form of a motion that the mayor initiate the process?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2844.188s">Madam</a> President, it's my understanding that $5,000 is the maximum award an individual can receive on a slip and fall in a public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2849.89s">It</a> also appears that the necessary releases were signed and that the city is now, I guess, making this individual whole pursuant to the claim that's before it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2859.832s">I've</a> moved for approval to pay, but so let me close the matter out and get Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=2862.993s">Rooney</a> the compensation that she deserves.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3067.333s">Madam</a> President, yes, thank you to Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3070.98s">You</a> know, this request is really in line with what we're seeing around the community and in neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3074.783s">If</a> you look at some of the newly opened establishments, my question as to whether or not the ratio is exactly what's been put out through way of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3082.249s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3082.709s">If</a> you look at some of the newer establishments, there's a lot of bar seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3085.492s">That</a> doesn't include outdoor seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3087.073s">It</a> only includes indoor seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3089.175s">So</a> I think this is something that's really in line with the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3092.677s">It's</a> also in line with what we're seeing in neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3095.72s">Councilor</a> Caraviello makes a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3097.301s">People</a> like to sit at bars, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3100.248s">Restaurants</a> also like to have that model because it allows them to cut down the amount of staff that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3104.25s">So</a> they can have one person serves multiple day of multiple people from one location. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3107.951s">So</a> it's also an operational issue and an operational efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3114.114s">So</a> with that being said, I support the resolution or item we have a second motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3381.858s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3382.918s">I</a> think the easiest answer to this question is, you know, why have the kiosk accepting change credit cards is because we don't have the capacity as a community time to take this endeavor at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3393.401s">I</a> think it was fully rolled out and it was not necessarily the best business decision the city could have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3400.364s">But</a> one of my biggest concerns that I had said when we looked at the revenue forecast previous years was that I'd hate to see the revenue deficit being made up from the backs of the residents of this community through pocket tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3415.86s">And</a> if we're gonna have hypervigilant parking enforcement offices, we have to give the people in this community a chance to be able to pay when they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3424.162s">And</a> I'd say walk 500 feet or 600 feet or 700 feet out of the business district that you're in to find another kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3430.843s">I</a> don't think that makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3432.743s">And</a> I really do think that this does focus around economic development and revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3437.504s">So</a> this is something that definitely warrants a good hot book. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3440.805s">And</a> I thank the council for bringing it up in the second motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3495.297s">on</a> the motion of vice-president berries to refer to the appointment of president it was my understanding that the paper had to be passed before august 8th for it to make the ballot um the revenue is going to be the revenue uh so these figures wouldn't necessarily reflect any accurate data or data points for us to have a informed discussion on it um you know if we get better revenue figures maybe then we could take a look at something but at this point you know i think that it's a little bit premature to keep a paper open on an override proposition based on override figures that are going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3525.437s">out</a> of date, and it would be my recommendation to have a paper received in place.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3651.823s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3654.023s">The</a> reason I say this is because the paper doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3656.164s">If</a> you look at what it says at the end, it says, from this assessment, the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3660.906s">The</a> deadline to make that was August 8th, according to Council of Business presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3665.067s">So</a> the paper's dead on arrival already. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3667.988s">If</a> the issue is that you want to have a conversation about revenues, we already have a paper that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3671.81s">We've</a> been asking the mayor to come and present to us quarterly as to what the revenue picture is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3676.051s">We</a> set the tax rate in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3678.396s">You</a> know, that's when we should really be stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3680.818s">That's</a> when we should really start talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3682.739s">When</a> we set the tax rate in December to fund the budget that we just passed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3740.174s">I</a> believe Mr. Baker said that the project started in 2005 and ended in 2007 and that the machines had a 15 year shelf life. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3745.537s">I</a> missed the beginning of that sentence, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=3747.438s">The</a> machines had a 15 year shelf life, we're coming up on year 15 at the end of the next fiscal year and some of the machines are starting to fail already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4010.194s">on</a> the motion of us, Madam President, just reiterate that the paper is in order to place on the ballot for the 11 23 election, an override question that had to be placed on the ballot by August 8 in order for the paper to be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4024.225s">The</a> paper is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4025.706s">So</a> we're having a meeting on something that's dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4028.448s">It's</a> in fact, it does pass.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4473.498s">I'd</a> just like to point out that there's really no need to amend anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4476.5s">If</a> you look at the agenda and we see paper 22026, which was filed the first meeting in January, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4484.858s">In</a> paper 22027, also filed the first meeting in January, requesting quarterly updates from the city, chief financial officer in the city's financial health, and a monthly copy of the Warren articles to see where we're spending our money, right, which is exactly what Councilman Bass is asking for in his amended paper, pretty much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4505.641s">meeting</a> with the finance team to discuss revenue shortfalls, revenue growth, and the like, which is what we've been asking for since January of this year, since the first meeting that this council met. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4517.655s">And</a> quite frankly, going back to the term before, and we haven't got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4523.772s">We</a> haven't got, again, the paper before us is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4527.113s">It's</a> dead on arrival. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4528.473s">It</a> was supposed to be passed to go to get on the ballot by August 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4532.274s">The</a> paper is asking to be placed on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4534.594s">We</a> have papers that are already readily available for us to act upon that haven't been acted upon, that have been on the table for eight months, with the administration failing to respond to them in any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4545.537s">Why</a> don't we take care of the first things first?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4659.278s">Madam</a> President, debt exclusion really shouldn't be used to address an operational deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4665.432s">The</a> debt exclusion is normally used to address the capital need. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4669.713s">You</a> take the debt exclusion out to pay off a bond over a certain period of time to build a building or to take care of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4677.136s">To</a> do a debt exclusion with an expiring use to hire 25 new DPW workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4681.357s">Well,</a> after 25 years, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4682.878s">That</a> debt exclusion falls off the books and then- You can't pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4685.439s">You</a> can't even legally do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4733.561s">Just</a> know that no matter present that do believe you spoke on that, I'm not gonna be able to make tomorrow's meeting I do have a work obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=4739.265s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5304.629s">And</a> listening to what my colleagues are saying and looking at paper 22451, I think that merging the two papers together and developing an agenda for discussion with our state delegation would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5316.539s">You</a> know, we have a paper that was passed on May 17th, June, July, August, now three months have passed, 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5322.765s">We</a> haven't had the meeting with Senator Jalen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5325.787s">Senator</a> Jalen hasn't been able to set up the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5327.309s">Maybe</a> the mayor's not available, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5329.643s">But,</a> you know, maybe it's time to reach out to the other members of our delegation to see if they can move this along a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5334.124s">You</a> know, a state senator has a much larger district to represent 160,000 people across three to four communities, whereas state representatives represent 40,000 people each, you know, across one or two communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5345.868s">So</a> maybe reaching out to our state delegation on the House side might be helpful in moving this endeavor forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5350.929s">But</a> I think it would make sense for us to merge this along with 22451. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5354.855s">and</a> develop an agenda for items of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5357.477s">Now,</a> I know we've passed a number of items relative to DCI roadways and other parcels and properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5363.942s">So</a> we can probably put together with the assistance of the city clerk, an agenda for discussion with a very short order and move on this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5431.765s">attack</a> the problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5433.146s">And</a> we're going to say, listen, let's talk about the Fellsway now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5435.668s">Let's</a> talk about the Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5437.43s">These</a> are the seven issues we have in the Fulton Heights now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5439.351s">Let's</a> talk about the Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5440.452s">Oh,</a> you did a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5441.313s">Now</a> come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5442.114s">Let's</a> talk about this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5443.015s">Let's</a> talk about this next. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5443.755s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5444.556s">Just</a> for an efficiency purpose, really more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5446.578s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5447.278s">The</a> state's going to think we're crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5448.319s">We</a> already sent them enough lunatic stuff as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5450.481s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5451.342s">This</a> is something that actually makes a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5452.783s">This</a> is something that matters in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5454.104s">This</a> is something we can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5455.565s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5456.426s">That's</a> why I get a little concerned when we send a lot of letters up to the statehouse that don't really have anything to do with real life issues that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5462.01s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5463.431s">You</a> know, in terms of nuts and bolts and service delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5466.833s">So,</a> you know, my concern is that, you know, if we're going and we're asking for help from the state, that we do it the right way, that we have a game plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5473.118s">We</a> have an order of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5474.299s">We</a> have an organizational effectiveness so that we don't just go in screaming and yelling because we got a call from a neighbor about how they don't like the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5482.045s">And,</a> you know, the goal is we tried, but we never get the result. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5486.305s">And</a> a lot of that has to do with planning more than anything else.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5880.638s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5881.898s">I'm</a> thinking it might make more sense that we <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5884.002s">as</a> a council, direct the DPW commissioner to address the issue and then report back to us in a defined period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5891.644s">You</a> know, it's an infrastructure improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5893.764s">The</a> DPW director's involved in all this type of work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5896.505s">When</a> it comes down to traffic management, plans, permits, or ground opening and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5900.525s">So</a> it might make sense for us to reach out to the DPW commissioner and say, DPW commissioner, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5906.427s">These</a> are projects that you're aware of, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5908.147s">Why</a> is the product not coming back in the metric way? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5910.368s">Why</a> is the product coming back in the DCR way? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5913.473s">please</a> explain to us why and what steps you take to remedy it because, you know, ultimately, the DC has, you know, when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of public works, our public works director is the person, our infrastructure person is the public works director. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5928.361s">The</a> city clerk can send a letter and wait for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5930.422s">It</a> seems like a lot of it might be technical in nature, and I don't know why. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5934.324s">It</a> might be a very easy answer to what Tim already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5938.792s">So</a> it might make sense for us to direct the director of public works to do these inquiries and report back to us in a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5945.016s">That's</a> just my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5946.016s">I</a> won't offer them a full motion or anything, but it just seems like it would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=5950.159s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6135.357s">He</a> has Madam President, we're talking about a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6138.698s">He</a> would turn this thing into a national project for a rocket ship to go to space to move.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6229.058s">I</a> would like to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=6231.3s">I'm</a> just trying to get it right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9273.264s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9275.599s">As</a> we've discussed in the past, the city of metric right now is undergoing, it's probably the largest electrical infrastructure project that it's seen in 40 years with the other source pipeline project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9286.096s">And</a> if. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9286.9s">We</a> talked back to 2013-2014 when this project first was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9292.743s">One</a> of the reasons that this project needed to come to play was because of the grid on the East Coast region and rolling brownouts that were occurring and the like, because the grid did not have the capacity to deal with the volume that's on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9306.09s">So,</a> when we talk about, you know, why are these power outages happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9312.193s">I</a> think that's something that we're well aware of and we've known about for the better part of a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9316.034s">And,</a> you know, we're in the process of a construction project that's attempting to address it in a regional fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9320.816s">So</a> that's something I point to keep in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9323.117s">And</a> also, because this construction project's going on, the load's being distributed to other parts of our grid, which is putting additional pressure on our grid, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9332.221s">So</a> that coupled with, you know, the heat wave, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9334.802s">And</a> the amount of people that are cranking up the ACs, I think, has put some strain on the remaining infrastructure that's in place here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9342.204s">At</a> least that's what I've been able to read up on and what I've been able to find out and speak with Mr. Gilligan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=9346.806s">So</a> with that being said, I move approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10806.68s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10807.601s">Any</a> further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10808.521s">Yes,</a> I appreciate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10810.623s">The</a> gentleman bringing this up, and, you know, we all have to be very hypervigilant over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10813.985s">That's</a> why I think, you know, when we talk with our friends and our neighbors and individuals that travel out of country, that we be sure that they take the appropriate steps when they come back to the country, back from vacations and back from stuff like that, that they take the appropriate steps to be sure that they're not infecting anybody else with some diseases like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10828.975s">But</a> I appreciate the gentleman bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10830.696s">I</a> too certainly have questions for the Board of Health in terms of the transmission of the disease and what steps we're taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10836.48s">in</a> order to prevent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10837.58s">It's</a> my understanding that was that immunization for this or vaccination for this at some point in time that was discontinued or eradicated due to the smallpox disease being eradicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10849.024s">Well,</a> I understand it's the same vaccine. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10851.025s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the gentleman and I second this motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=10880.902s">I</a> think my interpretation was misguided, Mr. President, but it is what it is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11085.053s">Madam</a> President, this is to address some of the inequities that have come up through our Medford Historical Commission and the handling of demolition delays and demolition permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11094.438s">When</a> we discussed the budget, we talked about what was going on over there and the circumstances, and I was in a position at that point in time to cut their budget entirely based upon the treatment that they provided to homeowners and business owners in this community that are trying to invest their money and message. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11107.145s">At</a> just last night's meeting, it was determined that one of the members, one of the voting members is actually not even residing in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11113.672s">It</a> was brought up at last night's meeting that there's an individual that's looking to file a cease and desist order against a historical commission and is threatening litigation against that historical commission right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11125.265s">So</a> there's a lot going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11126.528s">But</a> one thing that's not going on is houses getting saved and houses getting restored back to their political, cultural, historical significance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11134.577s">Now,</a> when we sit here and we look at this community and we see the number of houses that have been fixed in the last 22 years or restored in the last 22 years, I think one comes to mind, and that was by agreement, and that was 22 Toro Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11145.088s">And</a> after that, I don't think we've seen any successes, Madam President, based upon our current ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11150.919s">Right</a> now, we add 16 parts to court, for example, to an 18 month demolition delay project that would have been a multimillion dollar project that would have increased growth in our neighborhoods, it would have increased the tax base in our neighborhood, and it would have addressed housing in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11164.09s">Projects</a> fell through, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11165.211s">Because</a> they ran out of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11167.173s">Why</a> did they run out of funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11168.133s">Because</a> of the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11170.435s">So</a> what I'm doing is asking that this council revert back to the way that the demolition delay was prior to the changes that were made in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11180.782s">We</a> can go back to the drawing board and figure out something that works in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11184.243s">But</a> currently, right now, what we do doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11187.565s">We</a> talk about restoring and preserving historic houses with political or cultural significance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11194.787s">Then</a> you look at 20 Cushing Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11196.708s">Can</a> anybody tell me who grew up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11198.989s">Michael</a> McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11200.829s">His</a> father, Jack McGlynn, before him, owned the home, a business owner in this community, a former school committee member, a former city councilor, a former mayor, a former state representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11210.94s">His</a> two sons, Richard and Jack, Olympic medalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11217.803s">His</a> other son, Michael, the longest serving mayor in the history of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11223.124s">That</a> house isn't politically significant to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11226.166s">That</a> house hasn't been given a historical designation, but Pacelli's, a pizza shop is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11233.208s">Something's</a> significantly wrong with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11236.118s">All</a> right, but ultimately the bottom line is our ordinance doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11239.739s">Our</a> ordinance doesn't work and they're not reaching the goals that they've established. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11244.261s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I ask that this matter be forwarded to a committee of the whole for us to take a look at this, get redacted language and bring this back to a sense of normalcy and reality so that we can move forward as a community and we can continue to grow and not hold up people for inordinate amounts of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11265.149s">for</a> the process that is futile.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11394.653s">So</a> last night at last night's meeting, I believe it was applicant that was introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11401.37s">And</a> they said, this applicant's here before us just because they just want to share with us what's going on with their project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11406.355s">And</a> the applicant, is there anybody who had anything to say? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11409.058s">The</a> applicant says, yeah, I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11410.359s">That's</a> not what I'm here for at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11411.62s">I</a> don't know who told you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11412.821s">I</a> gave you a cease and desist letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11414.082s">I'm</a> trying to sue you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11414.883s">I</a> want my demolition permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11416.585s">So</a> it's not necessarily all done in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11419.187s">They</a> give good stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11420.809s">But</a> the fact of the matter is, there's been comments that say, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11424.172s">If</a> we hold you up, we're happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11426.694s">We've</a> completed our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11427.975s">Set</a> in live session. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11429.315s">That's</a> not what they're there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11430.296s">That's</a> not their objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11431.177s">That's</a> not the intent of the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11432.397s">They're</a> not living up to the legislative intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11434.799s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11435.139s">They've</a> gone way outside the scope of their legislative intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11438.261s">When</a> we look back to the beginning of our term, I'm sorry, we look back to 2021, when Governor Baker put out a release, I believe he said, in the Boston Globe, there was an article talking about boards and commissions running rampant in communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11450.829s">And</a> this is a perfect example.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11570.593s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11571.373s">It's</a> no longer historical commission it's a design review board. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11574.275s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11574.936s">Now</a> what it is is it's a group of people that have gotten together and said we're going to tell you what your house can and can't look like and we're going to tell you what you can and can't do to the largest purchase, right, regardless, regardless of whether or not the person intends on knocking the house down and building another one and improving our community and selling it or living in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11590.487s">All</a> right, they're not the building code enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11593.889s">All</a> right, and they're not the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11596.27s">All</a> right, so, and they're certainly not a design review board because the ordinance doesn't call for that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11601.972s">So</a> they're having individuals come before them and submit plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11605.633s">Oh,</a> these are what the plans will look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11606.874s">This</a> is what it'll look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11607.794s">This</a> is what it'll look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11609.235s">The</a> ZBA might shut that down in a heartbeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11611.876s">It</a> might not comply with building code. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11614.977s">It's</a> outside their scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11616.217s">It's</a> outside their authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11617.938s">It's</a> clear they've been abusing this power. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11620.299s">And</a> the reason it's clear is because if you're in the good old boys club, if you're in their network, <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11625.441s">you</a> seem to get an expedited permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11628.043s">If</a> you're not, then you don't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11721.049s">On</a> that profit that gets turned is an investment that comes back into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11724.895s">So</a> when that parcel gets sold, it gets taxed at a higher rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11728.199s">So</a> if we look at the parcel on West Street, for example, that sold for $600,000.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11736.486s">Right,</a> but you're also talking about not not the board of this person just bought this to make a profit, the city doesn't have any benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11743.63s">The</a> city has a great benefit when people invest in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11746.152s">And</a> if we look at West Street we had a parcel that sold for 618,000 that got redeveloped and then the redeveloped process sold for 2.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/xyqJQrsXvc0&t=11752.956s">All</a> right, that increases our tax base that gives us more money to do things we want to do.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs/2024-11-19_E3nlU10YCrs.html">City Council 07-19-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=327.311s">Last</a> night, Madam President, we looked at the recertification of our zoning ordinances, this was the type of project that we were looking to bring it project like this is going to be something that's going to be able to create new growth in our community rejuvenate regenerate our tax base and I think it's going to be something that's going to be good for method. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=343.763s">I</a> appreciate john for coming up there and doing his homework and answering the questions that we asked last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=348.443s">But</a> ultimately, by making the small changes, we're gonna be able to create jobs in this community, generate more new growth, more tax base, more linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=355.426s">So</a> I think it's gonna be something that's gonna be good for the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=583.726s">So</a> where exactly is this possible located? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=585.487s">It</a> appears to be grappa on the map.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=797.858s">Just,</a> if we accept it what I was thinking Council Scott probably was because we have the six day waiting period anyway after the close the public hearing that we request from the code enforcement officer listed suggestions as to what they would deem suitable for that area, and then we can put them on as restrictions to the special permit, when it comes for us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=897.814s">I</a> am. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=898.114s">I</a> mean, I just think that, you know, ultimately there's a situation that's going on down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=901.856s">Councilor</a> Scapelli and Councilor Caraviello are absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=903.897s">If</a> you're driving down in that area, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=905.607s">You</a> know, it's the auto mile, we have a lot of dealerships down there, a lot of car repair places down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=910.829s">And</a> what we're seeing is their vehicles getting parked on the public way, creating a lot of congestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=915.431s">Just</a> recently, I believe we passed a permit for Fresh Pond Automotive, I think it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=919.652s">And</a> although they have a lot of vehicles, a lot of parking for vehicles off street, if you drive past the location and take a look at it, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=928.623s">you</a> barely have an inch to get a car in or out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=930.946s">I</a> knew our new zoning act also spoke a little bit to what types of what types of the number of vehicles that you keep on a parcel and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=939.315s">So</a> I think it's going to come down to a code enforcement issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=941.737s">But</a> right now there is a problem that's down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=944.02s">The</a> one thing I will say is that I don't think that the <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=947.352s">It's</a> not gonna be any more detrimental of a use than what was there before, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=950.234s">It's</a> not like we're creating a situation and making it worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=952.336s">We</a> have an opportunity to remedy it, make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=954.558s">But</a> like Councilor Caput said, I'd like to see the guy be in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=958.121s">I'd</a> like to see him be able to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=960.183s">So</a> I think that the suggestion of asking the chief of police and the code enforcement officer to give us some suggestions as to what we can do to make it a little bit easier down there for their needs would make sense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=1806.301s">Is</a> there gonna be a where's Barry setting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2169.381s">Just</a> that most times those trucks, when they are parked, they do have someone that's inside them asleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2173.823s">Normally</a> they're long haul truckers that are, you know, limited by the amount of hours that they can travel on the road through federal DOT standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2183.567s">So</a> some where they could be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2186.65s">somewhere</a> else, but yeah.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2541.609s">I</a> second Councilor Scarpelli's motion to approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2946.673s">Great,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2948.073s">You're</a> very welcome.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=2952.014s">Second,</a> Councilor Scarpelli's motion to approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4441.603s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4443.324s">I</a> think it's important to point out that we have a deficit, because the council approved the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4450.966s">The</a> council approved the spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4452.506s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4453.787s">And</a> we certainly do have a revenue problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4457.668s">But</a> we also have a spending problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4460.129s">And</a> we have a prioritization of spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4463.53s">Okay,</a> so when we look at kind of override is the only two options I don't think that that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4468.807s">I</a> think, I think we had an opportunity to eliminate a lot of waste in this last budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4474.513s">When</a> we look at what's going on with KP law and this package here, $255,000 in outside legal fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4478.437s">That's</a> $255,000 that could have gone to the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4487.063s">The</a> mayor gave us $300,000 out of the utility account, so the lights might not be on at the hockey rink come the end of the school year, but we got the $300,000 back in the budget, because she took it out of the utilities account. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4498.326s">She</a> wanted to take it out of the contract account. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4501.027s">We</a> have a spending problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4505.729s">We</a> have an embraced development to generate new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4510.617s">We're</a> fighting 340B projects that would bring in millions and millions of dollars to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4514.639s">We</a> have the gentleman up here today talking about a small scale project that's gonna bring in $300,000 annually, just our permit fees and property taxes, plus the jobs it's gonna create, which is gonna bring more revenue into our community in the circular flow of a local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4530.688s">We</a> have inflated salaries in a top heavy school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4538.073s">We're</a> not investing money in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4540.114s">We're</a> investing money at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4543.455s">We're</a> investing money at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4544.696s">I</a> remember doing budgets with Roy Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4546.457s">He'd</a> get up here and he'd speak for five hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4549.218s">He'd</a> know every single dollar, where it was being spent, why it was being spent inside and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4554.501s">He</a> didn't talk about rubrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4556.081s">He</a> didn't call somebody up here to speak for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4558.583s">He</a> got paid $160,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4560.263s">He</a> came to work for 20 hours a day and he knew that budget inside and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4566.76s">We</a> have human resource issues across every single department in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4575.263s">And</a> we have a proven lack of fiscal constraint, transparency and mismanagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4582.585s">So</a> is now the time to give the administration more money to spend when they've shown us that they can't do it responsibly now? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4592.188s">And</a> we've been patent possible with it, improving spending above and beyond our means. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4598.937s">So</a> when we do that, yeah, I guess Councilor Bears is right when we spend above our means, the only thing we can do is ask for more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4607.76s">But</a> if we sit down, we take a look at the budget and we see that we have $100,000 human resource director in the school department, and 140,000 human resource director on the city side, and then I communicate, and then I'm working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4621.123s">I</a> think that's a duplication of efforts and wasteful spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4626.872s">We</a> need to look at this in a way that the individuals in this community if this goes through and quite frankly, I think that we do need to generate more revenue, how we do it is the question, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4637.037s">Now</a> if you look at the tax rate in the city I mentioned, it's very low compared to our neighboring communities, it's very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4641.739s">And</a> over time we've seen commercial properties in the number of passes that are commercial dwindle. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4646.581s">So</a> we're at about 7% now, you know what I mean, I'd like to see us at around 15 to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4651.658s">For</a> us to have that strong commercial tax base that we don't need to have this conversation every year, but we can't do that with the zoning Board of Appeals that doesn't embrace growth with a historical commission that won't let anybody improve their own homes to generate increased tax revenue and improve curb appeal and neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4670.21s">So,</a> wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4672.391s">This</a> is a very. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4674.013s">interesting</a> issue, and it's an issue that needs to be discussed, that needs to be talked about, because we cannot continue to go on this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4679.675s">We</a> absolutely cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4681.516s">Our</a> roads are the worst in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4683.657s">DPW</a> is the most understaffed in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4686.538s">$2.6</a> million for DPW personnel will go a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4689.92s">It</a> will go a long way, if the money ever gets there, if the money goes to where it's intended to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4697.143s">At</a> the very least, if this question does come to fruition, if this issue does come up, every individual should get an estimate as to what it's gonna cost them individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4706.911s">And</a> it would be great if we had an assessor in this community that could answer some questions and put that data and information together for us, but we don't even have an assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4715.898s">So</a> for us to do this right now, I think is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4719.201s">We're</a> looking at exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4721.743s">Exemptions</a> are great, but the money has to be shifted somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4726.254s">And</a> the more exemptions we pass, the more we're gonna squeeze those in the middle and they're already being squeezed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4732.74s">So</a> we have a lot to think about here and a lot to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4739.967s">I</a> just see this as a spending issue and a spending problem here in the community, as well as a number of other issues that are going on that I think are putting us in a position to be a little bit <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4752.246s">less</a> financially sound than we could be if we were a little bit more proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4755.988s">Three</a> years ago, we passed the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4758.969s">And</a> that budget had zero dollars and zero cents of deficit spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4763.711s">Three</a> years later, we spent $29.7 million in deficit spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4773.176s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=4776.538s">Thank</a> you, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5714.814s">First</a> of all, I think it's safe to say that the budget that we have right now isn't the budget that any of us want. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5719.799s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5720.36s">The</a> question is, will $12 million give us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5724.424s">And</a> I don't think it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5726.022s">because</a> the budget we have right now is the same budget that we've had for 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5729.403s">It's</a> just been tweaked and tweaked and tweaked and tweaked year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5732.464s">We've</a> never really had a major comprehensive reform or a look at the way we spend in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5736.365s">We've</a> never prioritized the way we spend in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5739.086s">I</a> called for a zero-based budget when COVID hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5742.286s">Perfect</a> opportunity for us to break it down to zero and build every department back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5746.347s">Start</a> using, how about metrics and data-driven decision-making instead of reactive decision-making, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5752.389s">We</a> didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5753.709s">Now,</a> week in and week out, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5755.914s">And</a> it's been going on for 30 years, you hear the same thing fix this sidewalk fix this road fix this street. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5761.463s">We</a> asked for more, we asked for priority spending in various areas across the community, and we're not getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5767.592s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5769.687s">I</a> see what Councilor bears is doing he's bringing a solution to a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5772.89s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5773.791s">I</a> think there's more than one way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5775.633s">I</a> know he thinks there's many ways to do it he's looked at them all, or the ones that he's looked at it, and he thinks that this is the best one. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5781.498s">All</a> right, and he thinks this is the best one because you know why it plugs the hole exactly right it stops all the bleeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5786.343s">We're</a> ready to rock and roll we're back to, we're back to even, and we're going to move forward right. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5792.027s">I</a> get it, I get where you're coming from, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5794.428s">I</a> really do, I get it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5796.11s">But</a> I still don't think that 12 million would give us the budget that we want or the budget that we're looking for or the spending in the priority areas that we've been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5806.356s">And</a> until we take that budget and break it down, break it down to zero to see whether or not we can make do with what we have a little more or a little less, I think we're doing, <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5822.095s">a</a> little bit of a disservice. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5823.256s">Now</a> I agree, there's not a lot of places you can cut, but there are places you can cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5827.518s">It's</a> not so much cutting as it is moving the shells around, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5831.141s">This</a> account might have to go into that account, just like end of the year transfers that we see every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5834.723s">We</a> pass a budget, the budget isn't the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5838.125s">At</a> the end of the year, they come to us and they say, there's a million dollars in the fire department's overtime account that wasn't spent, let's transfer it over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5845.352s">Right,</a> every year, there's a million dollars in this account that wasn't spent, let's transfer it over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5849.314s">The</a> budget's the best case scenario, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5851.634s">When</a> you look at the budget, the budget is just a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5853.835s">If</a> everything went perfect, this is how it would be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5856.676s">But</a> it's never spent that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5858.337s">It's</a> never, ever spent that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5860.498s">And</a> I think that there has to be a discussion, there has to be a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5865.9s">But</a> to say, let the voters, trust the voters, I've always trusted the voters, Justin. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5869.701s">I've</a> always trusted the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5871.322s">That's</a> why we're here, because the voters trust us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5875.035s">I've</a> trusted the voters I put my faith in them, and they've given me the opportunity to sit here and serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5880.756s">So,</a> when it comes up to a circumstance like this, where I think the process is a little bit flawed, because it's in the 11th hour, because we've been left with no other options, other than to say, can we live with this for another 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5895.76s">and</a> then start a process all over again, and exercise and futility if you must, at some points we think, because we have a partner that doesn't wanna cooperate, it doesn't wanna have a strong partnership with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5906.406s">A</a> chief of staff that comes up here and fights with us instead of works with us, gives us more defenses than answers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5914.691s">We're</a> gonna be in the same situation again, I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5917.452s">And</a> I can appreciate Councilor Calls and Councilor Beall bringing this issue up and saying, look it, we have a large scale problem and here's a large scale solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5927.175s">We</a> can keep putting band-aids on things or we can go in for surgery, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5931.277s">And</a> that's really what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5932.337s">This</a> is us making a decision as to whether or not we wanna do conservative treatment or go in for surgery. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5937.92s">And</a> that's something that needs to be weighed. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5940.601s">And</a> when you oppose with that question in your personal life, you surround yourself with the people, your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5947.784s">That's</a> our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5949.385s">That's</a> our family, the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5951.386s">And</a> you tell them what's going on and you get their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5956.082s">So</a> we really need to establish a process if this is the direction that we want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5961.486s">And</a> the process can't be this short. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5963.408s">I'd</a> be happy to have this discussion moving forward to get this ready to go at some point in time to get languages proper for us to see what our financial needs are and move on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5974.776s">But</a> now's not the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5976.097s">Now's</a> not the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5978.543s">when</a> we took a vote on Mystic Avenue in the middle of the summer, you would have thought Mayor Longo's head was gonna explode. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5985.645s">You</a> used that to catapult yourself into office. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5987.485s">You</a> thought that Stephanie Burke was gonna put apartments all up and down Mystic Avenue, no one was gonna be able to drive their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5993.426s">Never</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5994.426s">Nothing's</a> happened on Mystic Avenue since. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5998.147s">Nothing's</a> happened on Mystic Avenue since. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=5999.367s">There's</a> been no development, there's been no growth until this council passed the recodification of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6007.335s">and</a> was able to start generating revenue for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6009.697s">So</a> we have some tools in our toolbox too right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6012.258s">In</a> September, we're gonna get an RFP out. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6014.52s">I</a> mean, in September, we're gonna get an assistant city solicitor, we're told. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6017.042s">We're</a> gonna get an RFP out for our zoning consultant to continue to build upon the work that we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6021.965s">We're</a> gonna be able to generate revenue for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6024.567s">So</a> I think we're gonna be able to do our part in creating recurring non-tax-based, recurring revenue, not one-time revenue sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6036.522s">But</a> in terms of this question, in the direction that we're going in, I commend you on the hard work that you both put into this and the efforts that you put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6044.007s">I'm</a> not comfortable with it, based upon the timing and the process, more so than the question that's being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6051.031s">I</a> do have a couple of concerns that are legal in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6054.9s">surrounding</a> this? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6056.841s">Can</a> we put a question on that says $0 or $1? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6061.722s">Is</a> it plurality? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6062.962s">Is</a> it 50% of the people that voted or just 50% of the people that voted the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6067.343s">You</a> know, that would make this, that would enable this in an act? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6070.644s">You</a> know, so there are a couple of questions that I have related to the process of passage as well as the financial side of things without an assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6078.066s">I</a> just think we're in a real scary spot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6080.786s">We're</a> talking about assessments and exemptions <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6084.867s">moving,</a> shifting a pot of money around among a small group of people, we really need to know what the dollars and cents are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=6092.453s">Without</a> an assessor, we can't do that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7667.088s">If</a> I may offer a compromise, why don't we allow everyone to speak once and use their a lot of time and then they can come back up and speak a second time. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7673.831s">We're</a> not going to limit them to once. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7675.452s">Keep</a> them within their five minute framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7676.793s">Let</a> them speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=7677.293s">If</a> there are other people in line that want to come up and speak, let them and then we can keep talking until we're done.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10008.316s">The</a> city budget actually pays the most for parking, because it went from not paying anything to now paying over a million dollars a year.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10188.616s">I</a> don't think that that's a fair assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10190.397s">I</a> think everybody behind this reel gives a lot of their time and a lot of their effort, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10193.999s">I</a> don't think you can give enough time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10196.1s">To</a> make this city a better place, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10198.021s">So</a> when you make that, I'm a politician, trust me. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10200.182s">I</a> mean, I just don't think that's a fair characteristic.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10210.633s">Is</a> he giving you any reason not to trust him?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10364.652s">It's</a> not even a motion, it's just a rule in one sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10369.673s">It's</a> a reference to chapter 43, section 22 of the general laws, which says that if any member of the council objects, the measure should be postponed for that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10378.736s">So</a> it's postponed for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10382.999s">one</a> of the rules hasn't been debated.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10527.292s">Oh,</a> still move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10528.773s">That's</a> fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10578.418s">Leave</a> this companion paper that's the same amount of President 22435 and 22435 offered by Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10649.126s">Councilor</a> Caraviello's abstention, I'd just like to mention that he was also a great member of this Metro community, not just the Grace Church community. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10655.807s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10656.348s">And</a> served that country well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10662.519s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10968.582s">Why</a> don't we open it up to anybody that's in favor or against before, like.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=10999.892s">Is</a> there anyone else who would like to... Madam President, actually, I'd like to keep... Continue?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11014.666s">Madam</a> President, I ask that we keep the public hearing open for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11016.788s">You</a> need to... <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11022.068s">I'm</a> sorry, not to close the public hearing to keep it open for 90 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11030.117s">No,</a> not with approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11031.379s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11031.98s">Starbucks</a> right now is in the middle of a quite a public <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11037.297s">dispute</a> over the conditions that they placed their workers in allowing the five o'clock opening right now in the middle of a contract negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11044.462s">I</a> don't think it's the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11045.182s">There's</a> a strike going on at Starbucks right now for the Starbucks baristas relative to wages, hours and conditions of employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11052.207s">I</a> think that's something that needs to be remedied. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11054.008s">I</a> support the work of people and I think this corporate giant should go to the table, sit down with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11060.513s">They're</a> not broke.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11065.393s">No,</a> I just wanna keep the public hearing open for 90 days to be sure that our friends at the United Commercial Workers can come down and express their concern about this when the time is right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11075.817s">I</a> was just gonna second the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11241.353s">So</a> would taking these roadways from the school department as private property and then making them public ways allow us to utilize CHAPA 90 funds to repair them?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11324.143s">Let's</a> keep the comment period open in case there's any question about whether or not we need to have input from the traffic commission on such a matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11330.246s">I</a> don't think we do, but let's keep it open just in case friends of the traffic commission have some input they'd like to make.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=11376.913s">Why</a> don't we just table all the Councilor Covey was okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12050.373s">I'm</a> the other guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12054.074s">I'm</a> that guy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12057.675s">I</a> know, I know, but we don't live in Las Vegas, you know, 55 inch LCD screens.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12075.26s">And</a> my uncle was the quartermaster at the Milton VFW for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12079.043s">So</a> I know what you're dealing with out there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12083.166s">So</a> these are gonna be 55 inch screens?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12086.128s">And</a> there's only gonna be two of them?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12091.092s">Okay,</a> so we're looking at 220 inches, square inches of illuminated sign.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12098.917s">Okay,</a> in two locations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12103.49s">Designed</a> for pedestrians to look at when they're crossing the street, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12109.696s">They</a> don't have to if they don't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12113.76s">Are</a> there crosswalks in the locations where they are about the areas where the signs are going to be located?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12143.017s">I</a> know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12144.698s">With</a> the placement, I'd like to see the placement be placed where a crosswalk is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12148.279s">So</a> that at the very least, the stop sign crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12150.4s">So,</a> I mean, someone's going to look at a distracted driving, something we talk about all the time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12154.281s">If</a> you guys have driven in this parking lot, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12156.922s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12157.242s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12157.842s">You'd</a> want the bulldozer, not the truck, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12159.363s">I</a> mean, it's crazy in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12160.303s">There's</a> a lot of cars, a lot of vehicles, a lot of heavy trucking going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12162.884s">I'm</a> not so worried about the internal illumination because I mean who's your neighbor half afraid you know what I mean I don't think that they're going to really mind too much if they see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12172.651s">In</a> terms of moving forward we have two now is there plans for expansion or is it just going to be two?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12192.272s">Yeah,</a> but if you work at Brown Rudnick, and you guys are slick talking lawyers, we approve it once, next thing you know, you come in and, oh, you approved it last time, now you're out, you can't do that now, what are you gonna do?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12232.347s">Wait</a> a minute, we're gonna get something electric before Somerville?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12239.377s">No,</a> you've addressed my concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12240.557s">As</a> long as the crosswalk issue is addressed and this is located in close proximity to a crosswalk and stop sign, I certainly have no problem with it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12379.107s">But</a> if someone's not charging, they don't have an electric vehicle, they just park there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/E3nlU10YCrs&t=12394.458s">And</a> have they expressed willingness to do that?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=201.243s">If</a> we could get a financial presentation from the finance department, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=417.003s">Madam</a> President for me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=419.404s">Can</a> you just discuss the nature of the settlement for $137,000?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=531.917s">Previous</a> city solicitor did something happen to our existing city solicitor that we need to know about.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=544.963s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=546.303s">Madam</a> President, in my, on my desk today when I came in I found a packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=551.506s">And</a> it was provided to us from local 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=555.217s">I</a> look at 25 rather and going through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=558.718s">It</a> has a number of charges documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=564.38s">I'm</a> wondering if, you know, based upon the fact that there's $192,000 of overspending in this account right now, and the administration's asking us to transfer that from the fire department public safety to legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=576.745s">I'm</a> hoping maybe gentlemen that gave us this packet can just give us a brief outline as to what's in it so that we have a better understanding as to what's going on on the side of things.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=713.262s">On</a> the underlying question, Madam President, if we could just get a review of the packet related to the law line item from- Yeah, I'm not sure I even did that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=722.668s">The</a> messenger did pass it out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=725.831s">It's</a> quite voluminous.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1588.031s">I</a> just do want to point back out to the meeting we had with Mr. Silverstein that said that these attorneys are not attorneys for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1597.618s">These</a> attorneys don't work for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1599.987s">His</a> attorneys don't work for anybody but the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1602.488s">Their</a> client is the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1604.009s">That's</a> who their client is. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1604.969s">That's</a> where their loyalties lie, not to the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1608.01s">He</a> made that clear.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1622.636s">How</a> much longer is the lying going to go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1625.337s">That's</a> my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1627.392s">How</a> much longer is the buffaloing going to go on? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1629.653s">How</a> much longer are we going to be left in the dock? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1631.454s">And</a> then in the last 11th hour, you come up here and ask us to spend hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1638.138s">That's</a> my question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1647.583s">How</a> much longer do we have to wait for the quarterly presentations from the finance director that we've asked for for three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1652.89s">Those</a> are questions I can ask, too, if those are the questions you were willing and ready to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=1656.433s">We've</a> been giving you an opportunity now for 36 months to do so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2572.988s">Why</a> can't we just approve the 500, and then when they certify the retained earnings, come back in the fall and do the other 250?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2772.059s">But</a> then after the retained earnings get certified in the fall, can you come back and request an additional 250,000 and then provide that additional rate?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2804.361s">Well,</a> I know, but earnings in three months, or maybe the way things are going.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2821.223s">So</a> right now, the only option we have is to either vote this paper through with $500,000 or table it until such time as the chief of staff can get the legal advice that this council has been asking for to have here during these meetings to get a determination as to whether or not the mayor's allowed to amend the paper for $250,000 on the floor the night of the meeting after it's been proposed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2876.189s">It's</a> a lot of procedure problems.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2893.141s">I</a> just want to be adamantly clear that I'm 110% favor of water sewer rate relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2899.024s">I</a> mean, that's what the retained earnings are flawed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2900.425s">That's</a> what we should be doing with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2901.986s">Keep</a> a healthy amount of reserves and then get the money back to the taxpayer, the back to the ratepayer for relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2906.348s">I</a> certainly think that this is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2908.229s">The</a> question is just when can we follow the proper mechanism to do it so that we don't find ourselves in a financial situation or a legal situation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2976.647s">Any</a> discussion on this paper from the Council, Madam President, the way I'm reading it is that this paper is in accord with the surrounding agreement with when casino, which would mean that <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2986.163s">They're</a> telling us we have to hire a motor vehicle graduate payment and a transportation engineer, or is this positions that were negotiated through this agreement? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2993.249s">Maybe</a> someone could elaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=2995.592s">Are</a> these positions something that we said, you know, when the casino gets open, we want you to fund these positions for the city of Medford annually, or is it a direct appropriation of money that they give us that we then turn and spend however we see fit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3027.598s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3027.898s">I'm</a> just wondering if this agreement dictates that these are the funds, these are where the funds need to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3033.543s">When</a> you read this, the language of it says that these appropriations are in accord with or in compliance with the Medford and Winn Casino surrounding <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3040.026s">Community</a> Impact Agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3041.067s">So</a> does that agreement say that when we'll fund an annual transportation engineer and an annual MEO3? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3048.274s">Or</a> does it say that they'll provide us with funds that we can use in a discretionary fashion when we see fit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3080.368s">So</a> the agreement with Wynn says that we can use these funds for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3084.631s">We're</a> choosing to use them for these two positions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3295.363s">I'd</a> like to sever the police cruisers from the rest of the paper of course.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3313.311s">Madam</a> President, we'll for approval or $165,000 to purchase a three new hybrid police cruisers to the police department.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3796.141s">Thank</a> you very much, Madam President, Mr. McGovern, how are you sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3800.224s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3800.764s">Quick</a> question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3802.9s">this</a> remediation project is the property owner responsible for payments of any of the radiation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3836.665s">Are</a> there any other remediation commitments from any of the neighbors that are privately owned parcels there? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3841.227s">I</a> believe they've been exhausted. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3842.588s">Has</a> the city made any payments to private entities or interests relative to the remediation that is possible or abiding?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3850.653s">If</a> you can give me a breakdown of that please from your office if the expenses have been made payments to the to any of butter of the mediation project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=3861.419s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4564.272s">If</a> you're able to go over that briefly, as it relates to police cruisers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4823.846s">Any</a> discussion or emotion on this paper, as I understand it, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4828.245s">This</a> appropriation would replace the revenue shortfalls that came with poor economic performance in regards to permitting meals taxes, hotel restaurant taxes, and new growth, as well as development permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4842.255s">The</a> ABA funds were put in place for us to replace revenues when we come into shortfalls like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4846.258s">So</a> it seems like it's something that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4849.26s">Whether</a> or not we want to, we need this $7 million in revenue to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4853.143s">We</a> need this $7 million in revenue to be sure that our government continues to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4856.745s">We</a> need this $7 million, the corporation I'm sorry not government corporations so this corporation operates. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=4863.029s">So,</a> I just wanted to make that quick.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8175.809s">Yeah,</a> it's not how I read chapter 44, section 32, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8179.53s">Well,</a> it's my understanding that, and Madam Mayor, thank you for being here, and I appreciate the fact that you've taken the hits you have, I've thrown them at you, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8186.493s">Yeah,</a> you're standing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8187.734s">You've</a> thrown some good ones, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8189.654s">I</a> learned from the best, you know, you sat next to me for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8191.515s">Yeah,</a> I did sit next to you, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8192.895s">I</a> missed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8193.496s">So,</a> my question is, looking at, <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8198.615s">Looking</a> at this 500,000 that you're talking about, you're taking out of negotiated salary accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8202.618s">When</a> the budget was presented, it was presented that there was a 2% cost of living adjustment was penciled into this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8208.624s">From</a> the negotiated salary accounts across all the open contracts.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8244.417s">Right,</a> because what I'm hearing is that we have some money set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8248.498s">We've</a> already made a commitment that it's going to be 2% cost of living adjustments, and now we're going to take money out of that account to fund these other items. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8256.84s">So</a> then that would leave less money on the table for these cost of living adjustments.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8290.03s">Right,</a> so what I'm saying, there are some contracts that are gonna be under negotiation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8293.071s">We</a> put money into a negotiated salaries account to fund, hopefully, a settled contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8297.173s">We've</a> appropriated those funds at 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8298.694s">Now</a> we're taking money out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8300.975s">So</a> there's not gonna be 2% in there for these negotiated contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8303.556s">Now,</a> quite frankly, I don't think that these men and women that are out working every day, coming to work every day, should take less than 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8308.738s">They</a> should get more than 2% anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8310.399s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8311.7s">So</a> if we're taking money. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8319.032s">All</a> we're doing is robbing Petey to pay Paul, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8320.814s">We're</a> saying make the council happy by giving them this money and opening the library, but now we get the contract problems still on our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8325.458s">We</a> have open contracts and we're taking money out of negotiated salary accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8328.58s">It's</a> a tug of war, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8330.942s">It's</a> a zero sum game. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8332.323s">All</a> we're doing is moving money from this part to this part.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8344.464s">Right,</a> but what I'm saying is based upon the financial presentation that's been given to us, the future budgeting projection has always been at 2% or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8352.027s">So</a> if we're rating that account and taking $500,000 out of it for an account that's already been looked at for future negotiated contracts, right, at 2%, we have less money in the pot now to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8363.131s">That</a> we'll have to cover with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8364.412s">We'll</a> have to cover with free cash or some other revenue stream, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8366.752s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=8367.453s">Okay,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=10605.229s">I</a> convinced you, huh?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13259.938s">Madam</a> President, I think it's also important to point out there's no paper for a proposition two and a half over right before this council this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13264.619s">This</a> is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13265.059s">The</a> only thing that's before us is the operating budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13267.6s">The</a> council is going to vote it up, vote it down and make changes to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13270.681s">The</a> question of a proposition two and a half over is not something that's going to be addressed this evening or solved this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=13275.642s">I</a> think the ma'am made that clear in her comments as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14322.516s">And</a> then they- Those NDA transfers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14325.258s">So</a> ultimately you had $194,000 of surplus funds in your account from last- Right, those are because I had those extra positions that are now gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14331.823s">Budgeted</a> positions that were vacant, so we didn't have a true number of your actual operating budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14343.552s">Right,</a> and that's why we talked about the $1.9 million appropriations overtime and whether or not you're gonna be able
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14379.022s">Madam</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14382.225s">Have</a> I talked about legal services?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14386.148s">There</a> is a line item in our budget number 0101515302. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14395.797s">Last</a> year, I put forward a motion asking that this line item be cut by the amount of $55,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14399.1s">Council</a> passed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14403.353s">Around</a> January, the administration came back and asked for supplemental appropriation to the budget, the amount of $55,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14408.898s">That</a> appropriation passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14410.399s">That</a> was the fund KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14412.421s">As</a> we look at our budget this year, we see that line item has a dollar figure attached to it of $81,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14419.067s">I'd</a> ask that that budget be reduced by $81,600 for that particular line item for professional legal services, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14429.027s">I</a> could go into the thousand reasons that I've stated previously, but I'll spare everybody based upon the late hour.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14516.53s">Well,</a> apparently, Madam President, the Council is doing much more than one ordinance per year, as stated previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14522.172s">I</a> guess we're getting some good work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14525.793s">I</a> quite frankly think we can operate without them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14528.032s">I</a> don't think we need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14529.512s">I</a> think that that money could be better spent, quite frankly, maybe with a zoning consultant to begin phase two of our zoning recartification. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14538.474s">As</a> we sat here for the last couple of weeks and we looked, we saw that we were able to generate millions of dollars in funds for this community through the recartification effort with the creation of an O2 district. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14549.336s">We've</a> generated probably close to $6 million worth of permitting fees and new growth in the community based upon this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14554.377s">So</a> I think that this is a worthwhile endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14555.858s">I</a> think it's a good expense, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14558.739s">And</a> I think making the cut makes sense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14735.793s">I</a> just like to point out that we were able to do it without KPMG law previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14741.195s">I</a> understand the chief's point. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14742.315s">I</a> understand the chief's point about reform and how things have changed, and I do, and I get it, chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14746.836s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14760.472s">Okay,</a> but just the implementation of police reform to come out of the purchasing office if that's the case for a specific scope of service for that, for that purpose.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14790.34s">Well,</a> I would assume we have a city solicitor in this community that would pick up the phone and take that call and be able to provide you with that guidance, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14795.742s">And</a> I think that that's part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14796.963s">I</a> think we're moving away from our in-house city solicitor, who has the institutional knowledge of 20 years of working in this building, and we're moving away from them to a private service <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14805.923s">that's</a> being paid where we see a new face every other day and a new person every other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14810.207s">Right</a> now, when Councilor Caraviello met with the mayor to discuss the future of legal services here to the council, the discussion was pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14819.255s">The</a> mayor made an offer, the council rejected it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14821.757s">The</a> mayor said that's your offer and walked away and that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14824.76s">And</a> then there was no negotiation discussion about it until tonight when we heard that there might be <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14830.064s">reallocation</a> of funds that they're going to take it out of the negotiated salary accounts, which is set up to provide the funds for your employees and for the employees that sit behind you to fund this want for the council and it's not really a want it's a need we need this right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14842.789s">So,</a> quite frankly, we did this last year and we were able to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14847.719s">We're</a> able to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14848.46s">We</a> did it last year, we're able to survive, but I don't think it's something that's going to impact our operations to the point of red flags. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14855.567s">I</a> think that it's something that we're going to be able to work through. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14857.93s">And</a> if the administration is serious about what they said, but they want to work with us and they want to put together a budget that works, then we'll be happy to come back to the table and discuss this further. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=14865.237s">But</a> the council needs certain tools in their toolbox to be successful as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15108.408s">Mr.</a> Bailey, I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15109.689s">I</a> mean, here we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15111.633s">But</a> just city departments we get the city budget here and as I look at this budget and I see all the city departments talking about how they need legal services right and then I look at the budget here and I see the city department it's called legislative. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15122.903s">That's</a> us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15123.723s">We're</a> a city department as well, and we also need the service, and we're not getting it to the level that we need it at. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15128.725s">So</a> that's why we're taking the action. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15129.905s">That's</a> why I'm taking the action I'm taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15131.306s">I</a> don't know what my colleagues are gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15133.206s">They've</a> supported this measure in the past, and I'm pretty sure they're gonna support it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15136.547s">But</a> I think that, again, like Councilor Scarpelli said, all those things that they do for you, they don't do for us, but we need them to do for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15143.109s">And</a> that's why we're making this move. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15145.61s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15276.743s">Madam</a> President, last meeting we talked a little bit about our prestigious historic commission and I had discussed my desire to slash that budget based upon the <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15288.634s">actions</a> that they tend to live by, which is not, in my opinion, good for business here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15297.702s">Ultimately,</a> we do have an appropriation before us for what looks like $36,500, but part of that's a matching grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15305.371s">And</a> if I can get a commitment from my colleagues to have a committee of the whole on this to discuss the ordinance, I'd be happy to move off of my defunding of the historic commission for this point in time for us to sit down and have some talk over the ordinance to see if we can create an ordinance that actually works in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15319.689s">When</a> you look at the historic commission and you ask how many houses have been saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15323.113s">through</a> the demolition delay process over the past 20 years, I think the answer is one, 22 Turoev, and that was done with a deed of restriction with the buyer prior to the purchase of the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15334.355s">So</a> ultimately, we have an ordinance that's a place that doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15337.516s">It's</a> morphed itself into more of a design review board, and I don't think that it's really meeting the objections in the legislative intent that has been outlined in the ordinance when it was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15347.337s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, in an effort to <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15350.735s">provide</a> the city with the ability to receive the matching grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=15355.199s">If</a> I can get a commitment from my colleagues to move forward and have a Committee of the Whole on this issue to review the ordinance, I'd be happy to no longer further introduce that measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16546.651s">Madam</a> President, I as one member of this body support increasing the funding to the library, but I don't support taking out of the negotiated salaries line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16553.873s">That's</a> the money that's been set aside to pay the cost of living adjustments for the people that came up here and told us their story this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16561.708s">So</a> I just don't feel comfortable taking him out of that account, because all we're doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16566.892s">We</a> have a problem over here and a problem over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16568.333s">We're</a> going to take it from over here and put it over here, and then we'll deal with that problem later. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16572.715s">I</a> don't think that makes good sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=16574.016s">I</a> think it makes political sense, but I don't think it makes good fiscal sense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18064.062s">Does</a> Shane get paid for next day now? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18068.287s">Because</a> he's been here for two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18069.969s">So</a> Shane should definitely get paid twice.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18395.262s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18397.685s">First</a> of all, I think this council owes you a debt of gratitude because it wouldn't be where we are today, if it wasn't for your persistence. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18406.657s">You're</a> not allowed to sit down we're going to give you what you want the big seat you got to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18412.424s">But</a> we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for your persistence. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18415.967s">Since</a> your election as council president, you've been across the hall banging on the door saying, when are we going to start the budget hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18421.191s">When</a> are we going to start the budget hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18422.351s">When</a> are we going to start the budget hearings? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18423.873s">And</a> it's because of that persistence that we're able to make the decisions that we've made tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18428.636s">And</a> we were also able to receive the information that we've received, albeit in a fashion that maybe not satisfied many of us, but nonetheless got us through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18437.843s">Now,</a> quite frankly, for me, Madam President, this isn't about an organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18441.366s">This</a> isn't about a corporation, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18444.308s">This</a> is about our city, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18445.61s">This</a> is about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18447.111s">It's</a> about our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18448.832s">It's</a> about our family, our kids, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18450.954s">It's</a> about the men and women that go to work every day and try to make this city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18457.72s">And</a> when we look at what's going on before COVID and since, we've seen an absolute HR nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18465.756s">when</a> it comes to various department heads in this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18470.38s">We've</a> seen the council call for quarterly meetings on the financial health of this community to no avail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18478.206s">We've</a> seen the council beg and plead for a copy of the monthly warrant articles, showing us where the money's being spent to the point where we've had to ask that the solicitor draft an ordinance for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18490.195s">When</a> COVID hit, I thought it was the perfect opportunity for us to hit the reset button. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18496.381s">to</a> look at some zero-based budgeting, where appropriations are actually based upon measurables, not a recycled budget from when Mr. Glione was the town manager, with little modifications throughout the last 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18513.266s">So</a> here we are asking for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18516.627s">Between</a> May and July, we virtually go undergoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18520.269s">And</a> then come May and June, the council's got a seat at the table finally. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18526.216s">And</a> when we finally have a seat at the table and we raise all those issues that we talked about for the last year, we get told any action other than a rubber stamp will be detrimental to this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18540.642s">I</a> don't think we can operate like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18544.123s">I</a> don't think we can continue to afford to operate like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18546.804s">There's</a> not a road in this street that you, not a road or a street in the city that you can drive down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18551.887s">It's</a> not in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18554.954s">There's</a> not a road or a street in this city that doesn't have a stump that's seven feet tall for some reason, but all the stumps are this tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18560.517s">They're</a> gonna cut the tree down, cut the tree down. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18562.057s">I</a> mean, come on, enough's enough, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18563.738s">I</a> mean, the things are gigantic, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18565.699s">At</a> the end of the day, you know, services have been degraded to the point where we have to hit the reset button. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18574.804s">And,</a> you know, as I said, for me, this is about this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18579.966s">This</a> is about our neighbors, our kids, our families, and the hard working men and women that go to work every day to make this city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18587.614s">Those</a> are the people with their boots on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18589.736s">Those</a> aren't the people with these things in front of their desks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18592.118s">All</a> right, we're not the ones that make the city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18594.12s">We</a> make informed decisions to move that process along. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18596.983s">But</a> it's the people in this room that were up here advocating and fighting for themselves that make the city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18602.189s">And</a> they're what make a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18604.317s">And</a> quite frankly, I think that this budget doesn't support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18607.58s">It</a> misses the mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18608.941s">And</a> for that reason, I won't be voting for it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18675.913s">No</a> more important financial responsibility from our finance office than the fiscal health of this community and in the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18681.939s">All</a> right, I don't care what else is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18683.881s">Nothing's</a> more important than the fiscal health of this city, and the operating budget, because we can't operate without. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18689.186s">We</a> can't move forward right so we got to get back to a spot where we can operate, and we can deliver services and we're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18695.693s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18831.169s">We</a> have five and a half hours, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18834.258s">Madam</a> President, I've been out for five and a half hours.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18843.844s">I</a> have a question as to whether or not a meeting can even go past midnight into the next day when it's been posted for yesterday.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18936.015s">22-409.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=18936.415s">Leilaniwa's</a> petition for grant of location.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19154.91s">Two</a> questions, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19156.031s">The</a> first question is it appears based upon the reading of this application that all the work will be done exclusively along the sidewalk?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19186.112s">Will</a> there be a traffic planning plan there? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19188.814s">Will</a> the road be closed down?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19233.771s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19234.051s">I</a> heard that Somerville really likes it if you could detour the cars through Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19237.694s">Is</a> that a metric when you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19240.256s">But</a> all right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19241.978s">Now,</a> how long is this going to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19245.361s">Eight</a> weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19246.522s">Eight</a> to 10 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19249.805s">And</a> when are you going to be doing the work during the day?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19370.033s">Madam</a> President, if I do recall, <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19372.683s">There</a> was some discussion when they were doing some Greenland extension work that we had half a street paved curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19379.468s">If</a> I'm not mistaken, at one point in time, maybe within the last several years, maybe the city engineer, the former city engineer and now DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19388.875s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19425.188s">Forget</a> about that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19427.249s">When</a> did we repave that street? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19428.83s">Was</a> that within the last five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19430.61s">Yes,</a> it does fall into more than five years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19447.966s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19448.827s">So</a> we get it this way, but you guys will figure out this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19451.368s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19451.768s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19452.088s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19452.748s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19493.467s">that</a> I would even not move to waive it would be due to the large scale community act activity from some of the residents of the Lincoln Kennedy condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19502.889s">I</a> want to make sure that they're well aware that this project is going to take place before it goes off.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19666.675s">I</a> just want to make a note that this is the first time anything that said Brooks, master plan on it, that Tom Lincoln wasn't here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19674.081s">I</a> hope he's okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19916.364s">I</a> believe that the way that CPC is structured is that there's a certain statutory positions that are required representatives from the Park Commission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19925.972s">Representatives</a> from the Historic Commission, and then we have some open positions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19929.795s">And</a> those open positions would be subject to council approval where the other positions are not, if I'm not mistaken, correct, Joan? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19935.379s">It's</a> been a long time since we worked on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19937.161s">I</a> know, I know, a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19938.642s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19940.123s">Now,</a> where you are coming in as a general <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19945.646s">nominee.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19947.007s">I</a> heard you say a little bit about housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19950.689s">Is</a> that what your focus is going to be on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19952.47s">Or</a> is that going to be one of your areas of expertise that you're offering us here? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19957.533s">Or,</a> you know, why do you want to be on the CPC? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19960.015s">Why</a> should we vote for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19961.616s">I</a> guess is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19962.616s">That's</a> what they ask me when I run for office every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=19964.417s">Let's</a> ask you that question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20010.3s">and</a> can we expect you to fill out the duration of the term? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20015.204s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20342.761s">So</a> it's now June 29th at 1249 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20353.174s">This</a> council met as a body in May and set their budget priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20361.039s">That</a> was like seven weeks ago, eight weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20365.622s">We</a> went through an exercise of reviewing each department's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20369.364s">And</a> when we reviewed their budget, we continued to reiterate what our priorities were. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20378.489s">We</a> went through another exercise of going through a budget presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20385.455s">And</a> now all of a sudden, at quarter one in the morning, the day before, the budget needs to be passed, we're at the table negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20394.9s">There's</a> something fundamentally wrong with this process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20409.82s">So</a> now I sit here and I remember like in 2018 when at one o'clock in the morning, we took a vote about Mr. Gaff and there was outrage. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20420.227s">We're</a> doing it in the shadow of darkness. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20422.869s">The</a> people can't pay attention to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20425.15s">What's</a> the story here? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20426.651s">We</a> should have been at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20428.889s">the</a> week after we put this council priority agenda list out. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20433.755s">And</a> to have it be put on us now to be brought to the table to negotiate at one o'clock in the morning, literally like 46 hours before the fiscal year ends is irresponsible, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20446.037s">quite</a> frankly, we've all set it behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20448.16s">Nobody</a> makes good decisions after 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20450.423s">Nobody</a> certainly makes good decisions after a seven hour meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20453.847s">And</a> now's the time for us to start negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20456.43s">There's</a> something fundamentally wrong with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20458.893s">And</a> I think part of it was the fact that nobody respected the council enough to think that they'd actually vote a budget down.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20474.194s">So,</a> now, for the first time, and I've been involved in metropolitan politics a long time, right, 2025 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20482.004s">For</a> the first time in my life, I've actually seen seven members of the Council come together and unify around one particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20490.25s">One</a> big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20491.611s">It's</a> something that has to tell a story, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20495.033s">It</a> has to speak volumes as to the process and what went on. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20503.07s">moment</a> on I don't think it's fair that we're sitting here or one in the morning trying to negotiate a deal to pass a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20509.373s">Less</a> than 2 days before the fiscal year closes with we were beaten down the door starting in April to stop this process we put our priorities out well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20519.298s">Well</a> before the public has given us this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20525.121s">So</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20527.892s">I</a> think that this process is fundamentally wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20530.794s">The</a> way that we're going about doing this is not transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20535.516s">It's</a> not transparent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20536.657s">I</a> mean, the taxpayers are sitting there watching this meeting for the last six hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20542.363s">And</a> now all of a sudden we get everything we want after we heard we're not going to get anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20546.986s">I'm</a> very confused by this process, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20549.748s">And</a> I, again, Madam Mayor, I give you a lot of credit for coming here and facing the beast. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20553.771s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20554.471s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20554.932s">You</a> know, you're in the belly of the beast. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20556.733s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20557.253s">You're</a> going to hear it on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20559.255s">You're</a> going to hear it on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20560.295s">You're</a> going to hear it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20561.476s">You're</a> here to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20562.197s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20562.617s">You</a> had to face the music and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20564.898s">Um,</a> but I'm not comfortable with this process at all or the way that it's going down.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20934.074s">The</a> way I'm hearing this is that we're gonna take money from facilities and give us what we're looking for, restore all the cuts that we just made, then they're gonna come and ask for more money later on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20949.108s">They're</a> gonna ask us for more money to make that appropriation, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20959.034s">I</a> just want a financial picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20960.215s">I</a> mean, because ultimately what we're doing is, in essence, we're just creating more spending down the road for later on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=20966.618s">So</a> we're gonna restore the facility's budget with free cash money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21536.538s">One</a> information on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21537.959s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21538.719s">It</a> doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21539.559s">We</a> can just make an ordinance that says 20 hours a week would be.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21551.892s">My</a> question is, when's it going to be filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21553.272s">I</a> mean, we can say, Oh, yeah, sounds good to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21554.872s">And</a> then, you know, January, February, March, we still wait for the position to be posted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21610.416s">I'm</a> assuming that the mayor would maintain her position as the appointing authority relative to the assistant city solicitors position?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21623.291s">member</a> of the council to be able to serve on the selection committee considering that or the city clerk therefore even with the person to be working in the council on the selection committee as they go through the process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21653.879s">How's</a> this any different than the veterans office, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21656.42s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21900.962s">We,</a> we also talked a little bit about the work that I videographer does the amount of hours that he puts in the fact that, you know, his salary, that position hasn't changed in terms of stipend for now, as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21917.957s">but</a> where we've made such a move to the hybrid version of meetings and the like, I'd like to see some sort of a cost of living adjustment or a salary adjustment to the videographer. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21929.088s">And</a> if we look at my budget here, we do a purchase of videographer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21934.553s">And</a> I'm hoping the city clerk can tell me whether or not 5202 would be the videographer services that we utilize for Shane.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21957.208s">The</a> way I see it, the kid barely makes minimum wage the way these meetings go. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21963.914s">So</a> I'd like to maybe revisit this and maybe make that an hourly position as opposed to having to be a monthly stipend position. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21972.821s">Because</a> right now I think he's getting $300 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21976.083s">And</a> quite frankly, you couldn't pay me $300 to do what he did tonight sitting in that room in the back over there listening to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21982.328s">So,</a> you know, ultimately, this needs to be rectified. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21985.269s">It's</a> something we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21986.669s">I</a> don't think this is going to be a budget break. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21988.13s">It's</a> not going to be one to hold us up. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=21989.59s">But</a> moving forward, I'd also like to get a commitment from the administration that they'd be willing to work with us on getting a videographer a more suitable wage than what is being compensated at right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22136.471s">500</a> bucks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22439.782s">Just</a> like the CPA, there are buckets that you can use it for, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22442.744s">We're</a> saying that there's $300,000 in ARPA funds that we know that we can use for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22448.167s">We</a> just have to make sure that we figure out what bucket that is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22454.61s">And</a> then just out of curiosity, if that money was there previously, and we were talking about the school budget for six hours, how come we didn't grab that money a long time ago and put that on the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22465.098s">And</a> we probably would've got this conversation short by three hours.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22478.088s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22479.589s">Yeah,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=22762.057s">For</a> Chief Buckley, no.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23048.482s">We're</a> going to hold the committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23054.284s">I</a> never offered the motion to reduce the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23056.525s">I</a> said that we'll talk about it via ordinance as opposed to finance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23065.788s">Madam</a> President, at the beginning of these discussions, I explained the reasons why I was going to vote no on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23073.255s">I'm</a> gonna have to find something else to talk about now that we've got 2 lawyers instead of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23077.359s">All</a> I wanted was a part-time lawyer, and we got two. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23079.56s">So</a> I'm very happy with the compromise that we were able to reach with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23083.784s">I</a> will be voting in favor of the budget this evening based upon the fact that we were able to restore $300,000 to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23088.828s">That's</a> for young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23092.392s">That's</a> for young public school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23093.693s">I</a> think this is gonna make a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23095.714s">I've</a> also been talking about ad nauseam, the need for this council to have the tools and the toolbox necessary to do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23101.742s">And</a> with the appropriation of $50,000 for us to continue looking at phase two for the zoning consultant, and also $85,000 for our assistant city solicitor that will work part-time at the city council, I think a lot of our concerns are going to be addressed through those two mechanisms. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23115.633s">So</a> with that being said, it was a pleasure to work with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23118.395s">I</a> was glad to see her here this evening so that we could actually work something out and negotiate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23122.598s">And</a> again, like I said, thank you to you, Madam President, for the work that you did in putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/hsUGO5ihrRw&t=23128.442s">and</a> also thank you to the mayor for coming down here to the belly of the beast and facing the music and being able to work with us to negotiate something that can satisfy us.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_FFLU4mONFeg/2024-11-18_FFLU4mONFeg.html">City Council 06-21-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=191.415s">Mr.</a> President, first of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Rafferty for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=194.378s">He's</a> actually here at our behest and our request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=197.14s">Previously,</a> he was here before us to get a common victuals license to open up his restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=201.645s">And</a> we had a little bit of discussion about what was gonna be in the menu and the like, and where it's an establishment that serves alcohol. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=207.33s">He</a> has received a alcohol permit from liquor licensing commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=211.532s">That</a> license goes to one and but I am city of Medford in order to get extended hours need to come before the council so Mister Rafferty and his wisdom is actually following the protocols and processes that are in place here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=222.817s">I</a> commend him for complying. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=224.658s">I</a> am someone who really likes to sell it to make it thrown out the middle of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=228.66s">So</a> I certainly support this measure wholeheartedly from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=232.781s">It</a> has been quite a buzz about the business around the community a lot of people are <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=236.623s">saying</a> good things about it, and I wish you the best of luck, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=238.844s">It's</a> also very nice to see someone who resides in the community to invest their hard-earned dollars in this community and open up a business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=244.266s">So,</a> me as one Councilor, and I'm sure my colleagues behind the rail, I'm more than happy and willing to help you out in any endeavor that you need moving forward to make sure that this is a smooth transition for you as you open this establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=256.925s">but</a> I support a lot of Mr. President, I'd offer the motion to waive the waiting period.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=871.802s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, Mr. Deveney of any of any being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=876.328s">Mr.</a> President, by way of history, I believe this O2 district was something that we created the rezoning recodification and first one in 60 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=884.7s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=885.0s">And</a> it was, um, well, we did stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=889.738s">This</a> parcel was actually the parcel that we had in mind when we started discussing this about a redevelopment opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=895.882s">Councilor</a> Caraviello and our economic development director spoke at great length about what we can do to bring biotech into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=902.087s">And</a> one of the things was to create this office two district and create some dimensional requirements that might meet some of the needs that developers like this gentleman have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=910.853s">I</a> was wondering if you could tell us how many number of jobs this would create in construction and also permanently once the facility is complete.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=936.682s">So</a> we're looking at one to 200 short term jobs that pay a good wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=940.906s">And</a> then one to 200 long-term jobs that also pay a good wage for people that work in this type of industry will be able to live in the community also.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=953.896s">And</a> also, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how much money this would generate for the city in permitting fees and also increased tax revenues.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=997.117s">Just</a> last week, Mr. President, we had a neighbor of this parcel come to us with similar request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1003.26s">They</a> informed us that they'd be able to create a very similar aspect of jobs and growth growth was a little bit bigger is a lot larger parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1013.445s">$3</a> million in permitting fees and $2.9 million in increased property tax revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1018.309s">This</a> project here, it should go pot and parcel with the approval that we just lended last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1024.554s">If</a> we're going to redevelop, let's redevelop the whole area at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1027.856s">We</a> also see a project that's going to be taking place down at Walkman Court near the side of the train tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1033.121s">So</a> with some proper planning in the next 12 to 18 months, we could see <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1038.945s">significant</a> expanded tax base down to new jobs, as well as some revitalized curb appeal down in an area that's somewhat run down and blighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1049.17s">So</a> this is something that I think is good for our community to support a lot of.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=1797.032s">Salem</a> Street or Salem Street, high street Salem Street.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2009.217s">We're</a> talking about a food truck permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2011.019s">This</a> isn't a food truck, this is a pushcart. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2012.76s">And</a> the city of Medford has an ordinance that prohibits pushcart services. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2018.787s">Right,</a> so whether or not we're for it or against it or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2023.279s">This</a> doesn't, this application isn't being presented to the council or the body in the right scope and form, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2028.002s">So</a> for us to vote on this as a food truck doesn't make sense because it's not a food truck, it's a pushcart. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2032.886s">We</a> have an ordinance that governs pushcarts at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2035.588s">It</a> might not be the answer that you want to see in terms of pushcarts are prohibited, I believe, in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2042.853s">But</a> from what I'm looking at here and what I see, I see a pushcart, not a food truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2047.376s">I</a> don't see this application as being appropriate for the food truck, <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2052.705s">application</a> process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2054.706s">Listen,</a> if you were here and you said I want a one day permit to go to go to circle in the square, which was a big event that we had last week, I want to say go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2061.49s">You</a> know, I share my council's concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2063.851s">But</a> I think that there is a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2066.052s">And</a> when we look at the draft food truck ordinance that this city hasn't been able to put their head around since 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2071.715s">Now,</a> something that I support, I think that the city should have the opportunity to bring food trucks and other opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2076.757s">And</a> I think competition, you know, is good for business, it drives costs down. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2080.579s">So</a> it's always a good thing for the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2082.351s">It</a> also creates better product for the consumer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2084.692s">So</a> it's price control and better product. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2086.193s">It's</a> great for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2087.073s">It's</a> great for the economy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2088.414s">Don't</a> get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2088.974s">I</a> think a food truck will be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2090.595s">A</a> food truck draft ordinance that we had that's been kicking around now for half a decade, has in it a contingency that says that the permit will be offered only if all businesses within 200 feet sign off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2104.422s">If</a> Maryland, as well as for the difference, doesn't care, then John, <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2110.152s">That</a> Martin Pastry doesn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2111.634s">And</a> they say, yeah, we have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2115.518s">Then</a> why would we? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2117.12s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2118.387s">It's</a> an opportunity to bring something new to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2120.568s">It's</a> an opportunity for us to try something different, to liven up a dead space, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2125.809s">I</a> know we have the chess club down there whenever they're down there in the summertime as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2129.751s">I</a> know that we've invested a lot of money in this area down here to bring people to the square under prior administrations, and that focus is somewhat soft. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2136.633s">So</a> I don't think it's a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2138.273s">I</a> don't at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2140.114s">I</a> share the concerns that my colleagues reiterated, have mentioned, and I also don't feel as though this is falling into the right process. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2147.656s">but</a> it's something that I think we could come up with a solution on and maybe Vic, I don't know what you think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2154.3s">Mr.</a> Schrader. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2154.9s">That</a> was a wicked long point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2157.301s">I</a> apologize for that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2186.605s">I</a> mean, I guess in the food truck ordinance, the way it was presented today, just like I did when it was presented before.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2221.273s">The</a> term's already over pretty much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2550.302s">You</a> know, welcome to Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2551.303s">You</a> know, we don't want to give a bad taste. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2552.423s">We</a> don't want to put on a bad taste anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2554.164s">We're</a> glad that you want to invest in our community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2556.305s">And</a> I don't think it sounds like that somewhat, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2558.947s">It</a> could be Boston.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2563.489s">So,</a> you know, obviously this is something I think that, you know, we've gotten a commitment from the majority of this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2568.392s">It's</a> something we want to work out, even if we create a pilot program and do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2572.834s">I'll</a> gladly be the pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2574.215s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2574.635s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2575.136s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2575.956s">You</a> know, I think that's just something that maybe we can put a little bit of green.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=2798.739s">We</a> wouldn't make the gentleman come back next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3131.658s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3132.699s">I</a> was wondering if the street was a private way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3135.56s">It</a> is not, okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3138.641s">That's</a> important.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3142.382s">They</a> put you on the list and they'd be on the list forever because they don't do private ways.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3206.77s">Maybe</a> the chief of staffs on the call and she can ask us you can help set up an appointment with trying to get an appointment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3235.998s">I</a> moved to take the budget off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3237.819s">How</a> fast do you think she'll come back?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3298.137s">Okay,</a> I mean she wants a meeting with the mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3309.088s">We</a> have a chief of staff is supposed to be responsible for this stuff because I don't know what else they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3313.833s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3314.114s">So</a> this is something that the chief of staff should handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3317.429s">All</a> right, we have a chief of people or whatever, we have an HR director to handle HR, we have a budget director to handle the budget, we have a chief of staff that handles what? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3324.072s">Us.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3527.828s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much and thank you to my colleagues for putting this on Mr. Fitzpatrick was a great guy had the opportunity to meet him on a couple of occasions at the American Legion through various community events that are going on with his sons Sean and Brian will both close friends, both following their father's footsteps, with a commitment to service with a commitment to the veterans in this community, and they've given a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3549.947s">instrumental</a> in decorating graves on Memorial Day and the like, really just great great individuals that give back to the city that there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3559.713s">Fitzgerald's</a> a great people, Fitzpatrick's a great people, and Mr. Fitzpatrick's gonna be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3563.776s">I</a> offer my condolences as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3615.847s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, if any of us have watched the news we've seen that it's going to be a bad season this year for ticks and the city of Medford is very blessed to have a great deal of open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3626.07s">The</a> Middlesex fellows the Medford woods, and 22 active and passive parks across our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3632.808s">But</a> with that comes the concern that we will be breeding ground for ticks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3637.67s">So</a> I'm asking that the Board of Health put together a mediation program, report back to the council what the cost would be, and whether or not this is something we can work on funding so that we can keep our community safe from a public health standpoint.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3744.619s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3745.359s">I</a> know by mechanism of law, I do believe we're audited every year, but we've been using the same firm, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3750.469s">two</a> decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3751.67s">So</a> at some point it becomes negligible, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3754.312s">They're</a> not going to say that they found something that they missed something last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3758.279s">they're</a> going to figure it out as they go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3760.301s">So</a> I think that it might be something we also want to see go out to bed or be sent through the inspector general's office or maybe through the DKM list of auditors that might be available and open to us so that we can pick them from a state approved list of contractors as opposed to having to put the matter out to bed or to seek private counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3777.013s">But</a> I think it's very important that if we do have this audit, that it's done in an open and transparent fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3781.517s">And</a> then the administration does conduct informational meetings throughout the process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3787.181s">Ultimately,</a> the biggest topic in this community right now is on municipal finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3792.282s">After</a> a little bit of yelling and screaming, the council was able to create enough noise where we found $4 million over in the administration side of things, they found $4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3801.744s">So,</a> you know, I think that as it goes forward, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in right now, not from a financial standpoint, but from a communication standpoint, if the administration stepped up to the plate and shared with us the information that we asked for and shared with us the information that we needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3816.133s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3816.553s">And</a> now as we sit here and we see the circumstances unfold, it gives us a reason to scratch our heads and raise question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3825.781s">Um,</a> so this is a vote that I'm happy to take this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3828.243s">Um,</a> you know, I hope that we're doing things the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3830.405s">I</a> hope that we're not mismanaging our money financially, but right now, you know, track record shows that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3836.67s">Um,</a> so I think this is a responsible resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3838.772s">I</a> think it's a responsible course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3841.093s">Um,</a> the question is going to lie in who's going to conduct <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3843.335s">the</a> audit, and whether or not it's going to be the same group that's been doing it year in and year out or if we're going to go and have some new fresh eyes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=3967.988s">Just</a> to reiterate your point, Mr. President, I guess it is obvious that the financial software isn't the only thing in this building that doesn't talk to each other.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4080.763s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly support them all heartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4082.765s">I</a> think these are very reflective of some of the comments that we had last week at our budget meeting when we discussed, you know, what's going on in this community from a financial standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4090.112s">A</a> lot's changed from last Tuesday to this Tuesday, obviously, with the Boston Globe coming out over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4094.676s">But</a> ultimately, I think that these are responsible questions that make sense, that put us in a position to make smart decisions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4102.17s">Ultimately,</a> we wanna create a long-term successful future for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4105.252s">We</a> wanna have the confidence and the ability to know that our taxpayers are gonna receive the level of services that they so deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4112.818s">And</a> I think that this is information that's pretty much plain and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4116.401s">They</a> get it in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4117.282s">I</a> don't understand why we can't get it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4119.103s">So</a> thank you for putting it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4120.084s">My</a> supporter will have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4120.844s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4122.105s">Councilor</a> Collins.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4555.825s">So</a> Councilor Bears, as I'm understanding this, this is more of a planning tool than actually a step towards putting an override measure on the ballot, but more or less a planning tool is to say to the mayor, Madam Mayor, we see what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4569.654s">Do</a> you see something different? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4571.775s">And</a> if you do, how are you gonna tackle it financially? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4575.377s">So</a> I just wanna be very clear that this isn't the beginning of a two and a half override ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4581.581s">What</a> this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4583.082s">us</a> getting information from the city administration necessary for us to make a determination as to what direction the city is going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4588.665s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4588.885s">But</a> this is a planning tool really where it's we're asking the administration to say this is where we are this is where we need to be how can we get there without doing this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4597.208s">Not</a> we need to do this so immediately do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4885.352s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4886.513s">I'm</a> just just a few minutes earlier this evening we had a gentleman before us who talked a little bit about a project that he wanted to do in an old to district that we just created. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4895.257s">And</a> as part of that discussion, we talked about how much money would be generated through these property taxes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4902.601s">And</a> I'm just trying to find my notes here because I want to see how much money he said it was in permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4910.925s">It</a> was $15 per thousand square feet for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4915.128s">So</a> I'm wondering, Mr. President, with the number of life science projects that are now coming online here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4920.35s">and</a> with the structural deficit that we see, whether or not it would make sense for us to raise that or to even attach permitting fees to the rate of inflation so that we don't have to get to a situation where annually or biannually or semi-annually or, I mean, quite frankly, I don't think these things have been looked at since the McGlynn administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4939.242s">They</a> can self-adjust based upon the inflation rate annually, as opposed to us having to pass an ordinance every year saying that this is what they're going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4949.067s">So</a> I think it might be an opportunity for us to generate some revenue to close the budget gap, and to do so in a way that's going to be recurring and not be on the back of the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FFLU4mONFeg&t=4957.59s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight in the paper Mr. President, I will withdraw, by the way, Councilor Carol.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_zPGgU4RrryE/2024-11-18_zPGgU4RrryE.html">City Council 06-14-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=257.314s">Madam</a> President, this is something I'm very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=259.236s">This</a> is the first petition that we've seen come before us after our newly codified zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=265.962s">This</a> is something that we worked on specifically, actually, to create an O2 district so that we could generate life science opportunities here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=273.328s">Mr.</a> Walsh is a property owner in the community, as he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=275.77s">He</a> owns a substantial amount of real estate here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=277.791s">He's</a> been a good neighbor, a good taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=280.133s">Mr.</a> wash I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the revenues that the city will generate down through this process if you could.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=316.055s">And</a> can you tell us right now what an estimate is we're getting out of that parcel?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=330.737s">I'm</a> not much of a math guy, but it sounds like quite an investment in quite a worthwhile initiative for this community to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=339.902s">You</a> know, we've talked about our commitment to life sciences, bringing jobs to this community to pay a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=345.005s">We</a> talked about, you know, the need to diversify our CIP in residential districts to keep us <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=353.054s">competitive</a> with a strong commercial tax base so that I residential property or there's not burdened with balancing the tax tax burden on their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=359.618s">I</a> think this project makes sense, Madam President, I support it wholeheartedly will prove.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2037.611s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2040.213s">It's</a> amazing how much things can change in three short years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2044.135s">And</a> FYI 2020 I remember that budget, I remember speaking on that budget when we voted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2049.157s">And</a> I believe my comments were something along the lines of this is the best city budget that I've seen as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2056.842s">That</a> was an FYI, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2060.183s">Looking</a> at Council of bears graphs. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2062.224s">FYI</a> 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2063.685s">What</a> was our deficit spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2066.168s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2067.669s">Three</a> years later, $29 million in deficit spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2077.696s">In</a> FY 2021, I spoke of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2080.878s">I</a> warned about us becoming reliant on these one-time revenues to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2089.424s">I</a> warned about creating a structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2093.146s">I</a> called for recurring <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2095.153s">non-tax-based</a> revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2097.074s">I</a> called for public-private partnerships for us to be able to offset some of this impact on the residential taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2105.401s">In</a> 2002, I said the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2112.466s">Since</a> 2001, this council has been calling on the administration to come before us on a quarterly basis to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2124.833s">the</a> financial and fiscal health and well-being of this community, to discuss our projected revenues versus our actual revenues, and to give us a snapshot each quarter as to where we are financially, so that come June 28th, seems to be the mayor's favorite day, we're not surprised with a situation <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2152.606s">that</a> puts us in a position that says, spend $7 million of reserves or I'm gonna have to cut teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2162.255s">In</a> fact, the budget that the mayor presented us says, spend $7 million of reserves and I'm still gonna cut teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2173.326s">This</a> is financial mismanagement at its finest. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2178.296s">We</a> have a mayor that's not interested in municipal finance and the superintendent of schools is not interested in school finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2184.058s">Three</a> years down the line, this is where we end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2189.52s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2190.501s">When</a> we abuse a finance director to the point where she has to leave the job for her own health and wellbeing, and we can't get someone to fill the spot for 10 months because we're bullying employees, this is where we end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2205.678s">When</a> you send every person in City Hall to come up here and carry your water and do your dirty work and give a three minute and 92nd budget presentation, and 92nd budget presentation over zoom over zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2220.206s">Thank</a> you, Council bus over zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2223.327s">How</a> important is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2228.15s">How</a> important is it 90% of life is showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2234.83s">At</a> least show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2236.531s">If</a> you're gonna give us bad news, look us in the eye and give it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2239.612s">Tell</a> us how we got here and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2240.893s">Because</a> I'm so tired of hearing one thing at this podium and then seeing a press release that says something totally different the same day. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2252.277s">Government</a> by press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2254.298s">No</a> transparency, no fiscal transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2256.639s">If</a> there was fiscal transparency, then this council would have had their quarterly meetings for the past four quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2265.081s">And</a> this wouldn't be a surprise to us, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2267.382s">And</a> then maybe we wouldn't be so outraged when the chief of staff comes up here and tries to sell us slush, because that's what it is, it's slush. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2275.165s">You</a> know what I mean?

<a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2366.219s">I</a> think that might have a little bit to do with it, a little bit to do with it, but you have to be present and you have to show up in order to develop these partnerships, in order to face the music, in order to get ahead of bad situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2380.528s">You</a> have to be present and you have to show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2385.852s">I'm</a> at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2387.502s">I'm</a> at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2388.783s">I</a> wanted one thing in this budget, and one thing only, to get Mark Wabrowski rehired so that we could go look at our zoning map, so that we as a council, again, again, acting as the adults in the room, can figure out a way for us to generate revenues to get us out of this mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2406.001s">But</a> for 50,000 bucks, now you just saw what $50,000 got us earlier this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2410.503s">The</a> gentleman came up here and he said that they have a parcel of land and they're getting about $100,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2415.684s">100,000</a> the city's getting out of it in property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2419.886s">And</a> through the work that this council did by creating an office two district, that parcel now is gonna generate us $3 million, $3 million in permitting fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2431.09s">And</a> the property taxes are gonna be $2.9 million higher than where they are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2438.883s">So</a> we got a consultant for 50 grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2441.505s">The</a> first project that walked in the door just got us 2.9 million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2448.371s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2448.751s">I</a> mean, like I said to Mr. Walsh, I'm not great at math, but I'm pretty sure these numbers will add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2454.216s">At</a> some point in time, these numbers will add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2456.157s">If</a> we can create growth, if we can generate revenue in this community, because if we're running in place and we're not generating at least 1.25% a year, we're losing, we're deficit spending again. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2468.641s">we</a> have to generate at least 1.25% of new growth annually for us to just run in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2476.706s">That's</a> why an assistant city solicitor for this council is so important, because we've seen what we can do when we get the tools in the toolbox for us to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2486.633s">And</a> there's not anybody behind this rail that's afraid to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2489.935s">We're</a> all present. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2491.316s">We're</a> all here ready to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2494.807s">I</a> think console base for going through the time, putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2498.429s">You</a> know, in years past this is something I said to him on the phone today in years past this is something that would have been we've ever would have been arguing yelling and screaming about this and that because you made a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2507.288s">He</a> made a suggestion that we have a problem, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2510.77s">Now,</a> I don't think that's a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2512.792s">I</a> think that's a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2513.852s">We</a> have a problem, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2515.473s">He</a> also made a suggestion that there's a few ways out of it, and one of them is taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2519.436s">Well,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2520.597s">Yeah,</a> if we're not gonna develop public-private partnerships, we're not gonna generate new non-tax revenues, there's no other way for us to get out of it other than deficit spend and borrow from our reserves and watch our bond rating crash and watch our interest rates rise so we can't borrow and we can't build and we can't maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2536.747s">The</a> conversation has to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2538.688s">The</a> conversation has to be had. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2540.768s">Now,</a> this council is not going to go magic wand, boom, the taxes got raised, pow, poof, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2545.41s">It's</a> going to be an open and public process, and the discussion has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2549.031s">I'm</a> not saying I want to see the taxes go up in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2551.671s">What</a> I am saying is I want to see the taxpayers receive the services that they deserve at a level that's above mediocrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2563.093s">Now,</a> I can count on my hand all the tires that I parked this year driving down our public streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2568.934s">Councilor</a> Tseng told me he got one not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2571.435s">This</a> gentleman owns a company that drives cars, a livery service, multiple vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2578.177s">I</a> can imagine, I can imagine the impact that this business owner is feeling for our lack of investments in our roads, the amount of money that he has to pay out of pocket on tires, on alignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2590.739s">Add</a> it all up, look what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2593.64s">All</a> right, add it all up and look what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2596.121s">We've</a> been asking for it, we've been calling for it for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2599.163s">The</a> only reason this is a surprise to us, the only reason this is a surprise to us is because someone wasn't being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2608.528s">And</a> that's the fact of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2609.888s">And</a> now we're gonna be put in a position where it's gonna say, spend the 7.5 million in reserves, potentially mortgage, potentially mortgage the financial and fiscal health of this community for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2624.535s">because</a> for the past 24 months, I didn't want to deal with you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2629.078s">Is</a> that fair? <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2630.799s">Not</a> to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2631.54s">It's</a> not about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2632.12s">I</a> don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2632.98s">It's</a> not about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2633.661s">It's</a> not being fair to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2634.902s">It's</a> being fair to the people that put us here and being fair to the people that rely on us to make good decisions on their behalf so they can continue to live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2645.413s">continue</a> to be a part of it and want to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2648.295s">Want</a> to be a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2649.235s">That's</a> the biggest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2650.616s">I</a> see people getting pushed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2652.257s">People</a> don't want to be involved anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2653.678s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2654.199s">I'm</a> so tired of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2655.379s">I'm</a> so tired of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2656.18s">I</a> can't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2658.861s">And</a> I think we're all getting there at some point because we keep asking, we keep asking, we keep begging, we keep crying. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2664.185s">Please</a> give us this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2666.026s">We</a> don't want it because we want to, you know, do something bad to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2669.108s">We</a> want it because we want to help this community and we want to do the job that we're elected to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2673.54s">And</a> sometimes that means bringing up unpopular issues and bringing up things that people might not want to hear, but it's a discussion that has to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2684.553s">You</a> got to hand it to Zach. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2686.395s">It</a> takes a lot of guts to do what he did tonight, to put this on the table and say, look, <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2691.141s">This</a> is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2692.142s">But</a> like I said before, and I'll say it again, once again, this body is acting like the adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2696.665s">So</a> thank you Constance for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2697.906s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2698.527s">I</a> certainly have no problem with a resolution going over these recommendations that you made. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2702.69s">I</a> think we need to get these key takeaways back from the administration so that we can make a more informed decision going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2710.356s">But</a> I'm very impressed with the work you did this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2712.597s">And</a> I thank you for it because it's necessary for someone <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2717.817s">to</a> tell the truth about the fiscal health of this community and what's going on and why we're in the situation we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2723.541s">And</a> not do it through press release and social media posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2729.246s">Use</a> the forum for what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2731.588s">So</a> I've talked far too much about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=2733.89s">Thank</a> you very much, Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4727.072s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much as we've all had discussions and talked about the cost of living here in the city of mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4732.507s">We've</a> also talked about the fact that many of our department heads don't live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4736.914s">And</a> we also talked about the fact that many of the people that work in this community can't afford to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4741.079s">This</a> council has been at the forefront of affordable housing issues looking at creating an affordable housing trust fund, looking at examining housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4749.998s">utilizing</a> Community Preservation Act funds to create affordable housing opportunities here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4755.241s">This</a> is something they did in Philadelphia, Mr. President, where they passed a council ordinance that required preference be given to city employee and retirees in the city of Philadelphia, and they apply for affordable housing lotteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4768.107s">So</a> if you think about it, the people that, you know, work for our city and our school department are retirees, they're the people that actually <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4775.631s">You</a> know, give their blood, sweat and tears to the community they're a part of the fabric of this community they want to stay in the community they live in they might be overhoused underemployed or under income, and can meet the guidelines, why not keep these people in the community instead of forcing them out by allowing them the opportunity to get a preference in affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4791.123s">Now</a> this isn't to say that this is something that you want to pass or don't want to pass what I'm asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4795.387s">is</a> what steps we can take. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4796.908s">And</a> then hopefully we can get a document or a draft to work off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4799.951s">So</a> I don't wanna say, you know, this is gonna be the end all be all at the end of the day, but there should be a process in place that we can look at and examine to see if this is something that would be worthwhile.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4852.094s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4853.295s">This</a> location is a crosswalk, and the crosswalk is fine to fall into disrepair the curb stone is totally completely removed going around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4860.919s">If</a> you know Rockwell Terrace Rockwell Terrace is the street that would stretch between Hickey Park and Gillis Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4867.842s">It's</a> a small little cut through. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4869.38s">Um,</a> that is traversed quite a bit by, um, the league baseball players, uh, dog walkers, people that utilize in the parking lot, like, um, it's a safe pathway for individuals to cut through, um, and utilize the open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4882.537s">But,</a> uh, the sidewalk has fallen at the disrepair of the homeowner on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4886.202s">is</a> now being faced with the situation where many vehicles and cars are parking up on the curb, very close to the home, to the point where, you know, she can't even walk by on the sidewalk to get into her house because the curb stones gone so cars are edging closer and closer and closer to her home. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4900.657s">but</a> this looks like it's something that's an easy fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4902.558s">They're</a> doing the Gillis Park accessibility project. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4905.18s">There's</a> a construction project that's underway right now that we just funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4908.642s">So</a> I'm hoping that based upon the reports that came out of the OCD and the status of that project and how it's moving along, that this is something that can be added in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4916.807s">It</a> should be a really low cost item. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4918.148s">It's</a> just some granite curb stoning that needs to be put in and a little bit of asphalt or concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4923.351s">So</a> it's not something that's going to <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4924.733s">break</a> the bank, the crosswalk doesn't have to be designed, it's already been designed, it's already there, it's just in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4929.815s">So</a> I'm hoping that this is something that can be addressed by the administration, but I would not hold my breath.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4952.975s">Mr.</a> President, this item is also on public participation portion of our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4956.377s">This</a> evening, we have Mr. Carroll and Mr. Kamara, both from the Chamber of Commerce that we're here, we're waiting to speak on it, where the night was going not quite according to agenda or plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=4965.841s">I</a> suggest to the gentleman that we could pass this resolution that's on the agenda this evening, not worry about that public participation paper, and they can come back at a later date to present on what their questions and concerns are surrounding the garage.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zPGgU4RrryE&t=5047.451s">Speaking</a> from the chair, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=45.338s">And</a> what paper is that what paper number looks like we have a public hearing and we also have on the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=624.916s">Madam</a> President, I for one don't have a problem with this application at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=628.539s">What</a> it does is revitalize an underdeveloped parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=630.82s">The</a> parcel's been vacant for quite some time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=632.661s">It's</a> been somewhat of an eyesore in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=635.263s">Also,</a> past use was a bank, future use is a bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=639.806s">Putting</a> a drive-thru teller <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=642.271s">machine</a> in this location, I don't think it's going to be much of an issue at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=645.694s">It</a> looks like they have the appropriate lead space to queue cars up, you're not going to back up into the street, and parking and, you know, square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=656.064s">So</a> I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=657.625s">I</a> second.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1181.078s">Is</a> there any questions from the council at this time Council night, Miss Connie welcome back I know last time you were here wasn't the most pleasant experience for you and apologize for that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1337.268s">Any</a> further questions from the Council Council night, Madam President, I as one member of this body, certainly have no opposition to this project I think that I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1345.512s">you</a> know, based upon the meetings that we had earlier in the evening, even, we really need to figure out what's going on underground and get that stuff taken care of so that we can take the necessary steps to resurface our roadways into a condition that is suitable and worthy of the taxpayers driving their vehicles on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1362.441s">Right</a> now, our roads are in the worst shape around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1364.562s">Like,</a> you know, you know when you're entering Medford because it kind of starts shaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1368.104s">So,</a> you know, with that being said, I think that this project for 195 feet will give us an opportunity to address some underground infrastructure concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1374.995s">I'm</a> hoping that the city engineer can speak a little bit about whether or not they coordinating any other underground infrastructure projects with the city during this period of time, while the grant location is being offered and the ground is going to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1385.5s">So</a> maybe the city clerk and the city engineer can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1388.342s">I</a> know this is Councilor Tseng's backyard, so I'm sure he's got a number of questions to ask about this coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1394.968s">but</a> ultimately I'm hoping that maybe the city engineer can talk a little bit about our underground infrastructure there, and if the ground's open, whether or not there's a need to do any other work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1667.368s">Madam</a> President, I do think it's also important to point out when you look at the conditions of improvement, the city engineer's office has been able to secure some mitigation for some existing defects in the sidewalks and streets there that aren't necessarily in relation to this project, but are going to get done as part of the project mitigation purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1684.836s">That's</a> something that I'm happy to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1685.857s">It's</a> something we've called for in the past, and I'm glad to see that it's making its way into these grants.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1988.832s">Madam</a> President, with all due respect, this is a pretty big issue we've been talking about for quite a bit of time, but I had no idea that they were coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1995.276s">I</a> don't know if anybody else had any awareness whether or not they were coming this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1998.138s">Oh,</a> they're here tonight to talk about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=1999.539s">Apparently,</a> that's what the city engineer just mentioned.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2809.002s">Councilor</a> Cabrera, I'll ask all my questions, thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2812.684s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2814.445s">I</a> had the opportunity to go through some of the files that weren't stolen from my desk by one of the members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2820.347s">And</a> what I found was a document dated 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2824.149s">And</a> this document was on May 19th, 2015, which is our initial introduction to the Ebersole Statistic to Woburn Pipeline Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2834.93s">At</a> that time, we had some discussions where they said that this was gonna go to the Department of Public Utilities and then construction was gonna start in 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2843.995s">In</a> 2017, I'm sorry, 2017 we met and this was pushed out to 2018 to start construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2854.2s">The</a> construction said it was gonna be nine vaults. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2857.802s">As</a> of our last meeting, February 4th, 2020, five of the nine vaults were completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2864.913s">As</a> we go through our old files and paperwork that we see here, it says Eversource is going to provide us with weekly updates via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2873.357s">There'd</a> be a Medford-specific website and Medford-specific community events and meetings surrounding this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2877.919s">We</a> haven't seen any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2878.74s">I</a> don't know how many requests we've made to get the curb stones removed from the front of Victory Park that have been sitting there for two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2886.044s">You</a> know, just small quality of life things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2887.704s">We</a> know it's going to take a while to get the construction done, but don't leave the place looking like a dump for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2892.936s">five,</a> actually seven, seven years now for seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2895.498s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2895.798s">So</a> I don't know how long it took them to build that tunnel in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2897.94s">I</a> think it was 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2898.3s">We're</a> almost halfway there. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2899.922s">I</a> mean, this is like the credit bridge part two. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2901.983s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2902.604s">We</a> got to get this thing done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2904.725s">Now</a> a quick question is the pipeline project portion in the city of Somerville complete?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2929.848s">Is</a> the pipeline project portion in Winchester complete.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2939.094s">Is</a> the pipeline portion in Woburn.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2968.661s">2015</a> was a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2974.284s">And</a> this still isn't done. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2975.664s">I</a> mean, there has to be some accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2979.379s">What</a> are the contributing factors to this taking so long? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2982.361s">Is</a> it that we don't have the crews to do the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2985.303s">Is</a> it that it had to be rebid? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2986.684s">I</a> think it had to be rebid at one point in time, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2990.647s">But</a> is it that we can't get police details to be out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2993.49s">Is</a> the city administration saying we can't run crews? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=2996.612s">What's</a> the holdup on the construction?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3033.676s">I</a> mean, we've had enough of these meetings in the past where I don't think anything's going to please us other than the job being done and everybody being out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3040.96s">The</a> residents of Winthrop Street now, since I've been on the council with my ninth year, we've done the Winthrop Street Rotary project that closed that area down for a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3051.285s">Then</a> they did three years of the Craddock Bridge, which destroyed traffic right through the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3056.107s">And</a> then we started the Ebersource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3058.048s">All</a> right, so for the past decade, this area has been just decimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3062.695s">with</a> traffic detours traffic management plans and underground construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3065.958s">So</a> it needs to get done and I don't fault you sir I know this isn't your fault and all this is a gigantic regional multi billion dollar project that you guys are trying to get done, but we have to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3077.228s">I</a> think we should take you up on your offer I think that this is something that could go into, you know, a little bit more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3083.29s">You</a> know, as I pull out some more files and notes, I'm gonna have more questions and I got enough of them in here in front of me to make this go on forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3090.731s">So</a> I'm gonna rest my case and I'm gonna take the gentleman up on his offer and make a request that this paper be referred to a committee of the whole for future date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3651.892s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3653.253s">After</a> a couple of years of uncertainty, a couple of years of confusion, we've finally seen a class go through the school year without having to learn remotely. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3663.9s">And</a> it's great to see the class of 2020 had to overcome, 2022 had to overcome some great adversity over their time in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3672.089s">And</a> I feel for them, Mr. President, I think that ultimately their ability to persevere through these difficult circumstances and reach the goals that they set their minds to shows what type of students that we <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3684.626s">bring</a> up here in the city of medicine, and I wish them all the best of luck in their future endeavors, whether that's going to the workforce to be coming a member of society or to continuing their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=3694.572s">I</a> think that this is very exciting time for these young adults and their future leaders of medicine so I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4013.445s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4014.725s">A</a> couple weeks ago I was up at the little league field and the Red Sox were playing the Dodgers it was a great game. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4022.019s">And</a> as I was walking the field with my wife, I was approached by a couple of staff members from our recreation department. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4027.765s">And</a> they were having a difficult time because they had pulled permits for an adaptive kickball league. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4032.489s">And</a> the baseball, one of the baseball teams was using the field permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4036.077s">And</a> this turned into a little bit of a what was that word you used earlier kerfuffle kerfuffle turn into a little bit of a kerfuffle and as I thought about it and I walked around the community and I look at our business districts I see these what are they called so five boards or Sophie messaging boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4050.685s">And</a> I thought it might make a lot of sense to see if we can install those in our public parks, so that we can put community notices up there I mean ultimately when you drive by our parks on a Saturday you'll see a place that park pack of soccer players. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4060.691s">They'll</a> go by Drainfield, you'll see baseball players there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4063.534s">You</a> go up to the Field of Dreams and you'll see lacrosse players up there all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4066.896s">So</a> I think it might make sense, Mr. President, as a way for us to expand the reach of our community notices, but also create some awareness about the permitting process, when the fields are available, who's gonna be using them, to take some of the confusion out of the game and to prevent kerfuffles like the one we've seen just a couple of weeks ago.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4151.57s">If</a> you take a look at our agenda, and we go to reports doing deadlines, you'll see paper 23039. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4159.532s">I'm</a> sorry, paper 22027, a monthly copy of the Warren articles from the chief financial officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4164.914s">Now</a> that was paper 27 from this term, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4167.614s">So</a> that must have been in the first two or three meetings, requesting that we get copies of the Warren articles each week, each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4173.136s">And</a> the Warren articles are actually where our money's going, where our bills are being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4176.837s">All</a> right, so we pass a budget and the budget says this is what the bills are gonna be, but the Warren articles are actually where we are spending our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4182.799s">And</a> I think it's very important that the council sees that information, especially based upon the financial mess that we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4188.868s">So</a> after two and a half years of begging for this information and having to get it in dribs and drabs and spatterings from the administration when they felt like giving it to us, I felt as though it was time for us, in order to really solidify our position here as being financial watchdogs in this community, that this information be solidified in the form of an ordinance so that it's not so mysterious and hard for us to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4212.255s">Now,</a> our new CFO, <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4214.349s">was</a> very gracious and made it sound like this is a public document which I agree with them it is, and then it would be no problem for us to get them and I don't think it should be either. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4222.502s">And</a> that's what our previous CFOs and previous chief of staffs have all said as well, but for some reason I still haven't seen one and I can't tell you how long <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4229.806s">So</a> with that being said, I think it's time that we we codify this to make it so that it's an official function of the position, so that they actually have to send it to us on a monthly basis as a requirement to their job, so that we have the information that we need to make informed decisions on behalf of the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4243.435s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4642.42s">I</a> feel like an old man now like the senior member over here for a minute of console caviar. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4647.385s">So,</a> Madam President, this was an idea rather came up in conversation with console beers and I ultimately when you take a look at the resolutions that this council passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4656.774s">We</a> pass a resolution and we send it to the administration and the administration supposed to respond to us within a specified timeframe is outlined in the city charter I believe it's seven to 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4665.827s">If</a> you take a look at the last six council packets that we have, you'll see that there's not one response to one council resolution in any one of those six packets, and that covers a span of six weeks so I think that's a little bit longer than seven to 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4679.821s">So,</a> my thinking behind this was that, you know, we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4684.398s">work</a> product that we're putting out, not necessarily just the talk that we're talking, we need to walk the walk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4690.161s">And</a> when we decided that the best use of our time would be in the committee process and committees as a whole and like one of the things that I always felt was lacking was our follow up on the items that left the council floor items that were on the agenda that left the council floor that went across the hall of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4708.942s">If</a> the administration doesn't respond what's the follow up right there's no follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4712.785s">So</a> I thought this was a good way for us to keep track of some of the things that we're trying to do to make a difference in this community and also hold the administration accountable to the regulatory confines that have been established for us to work harmoniously. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4728.59s">So</a> I think that this is a step in the right direction for us to be a little bit more transparent to show what it is we're looking for what it is we're asking for and how we want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4736.517s">And</a> it also gives the administration the opportunity to say look at this is what's going on this is what we're doing, and this is why we can or can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4743.403s">So</a> ultimately I think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4746.986s">Council</a> tracking sheet that the city clerk maintains already. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4750.408s">This</a> might take a little bit more updating and maybe bringing into sign of the times but I think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4756.711s">And</a> I'd like to actually see it on the reports to section of our agenda weekly so that when you look at our agenda every week we'll say, you know, Council paper to 2001 was this past outstanding papers only be included on the agenda something like that some, some of the items that we can hash out another committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4774.377s">But</a> I think it's certainly a step in the right direction for us to be a little bit more transparent to show the work that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4779.018s">Because</a> a lot of the work that we do doesn't necessarily take place on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=4782.799s">It</a> takes place outside of the council floor and we need to show that progress is being made.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5863.37s">I</a> mean, listen, I, I'm more focused on hyper local issues you know I didn't run for Congress I didn't run for state senator for Medford City Council I want to fix potholes I want to fix streets all right but I also want to protect people. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5873.438s">And</a> when I'm looking at this language and I'm listening to Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5879.643s">I</a> think all the saying is that Medford government should mind its business. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5885.571s">to</a> issues of sexuality, when we're being asked to enforce another state's laws and provisions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5923.392s">I</a> mean, let's look at it from just an operational standpoint, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5926.134s">Just</a> from, I mean, we just talked about having a $7.5 million budget deficit, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5930.096s">Let's</a> keep our streets safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5930.977s">Let's</a> worry about that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5931.837s">Let's</a> not get involved in other states, nonsensical policies.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5937.42s">Why</a> are we gonna get involved in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/CNgTCdqBpp8&t=5938.501s">That's</a> the way I look at it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_fy-aPUScOL4/2024-11-18_fy-aPUScOL4.html">City Council 05-31-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=698.423s">Is</a> that the air system?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=703.406s">If</a> I could just amend the paper or offer a B paper, Madam President, requesting that the mayor provide us with a report on the status of the Adopt-A-Site program. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=711.13s">Under</a> the McGlynn administration, the Adopt-A-Site program was relatively successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=715.873s">It</a> was a program where local businesses could adopt an island or a rotary or a site in the city, and then perform the upkeep and maintenance on it in exchange for a small advertising billboard on that parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=725.739s">and</a> that was something that seemed to work out pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=727.5s">So</a> I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with a report back on the status of that program.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=906.479s">Well,</a> it's good to see that DCR has been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=909.06s">I</a> didn't know if they were participating in No Mo' May or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=913.642s">But</a> I would like to ask the sponsor if I could, if you'd be willing for me to amend the schedule, just to request, amend the resolution rather to request the maintenance schedule for Medford-Holme parcels from the DCR and the DOT.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1312.301s">Madam</a> President, if I recall correctly, I think one of the biggest issues when this issue first came up was the fact that they didn't want fences, they wanted to be free range. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1320.029s">And</a> the issue was that when the dog is off leash, but in a fenced in or caged in area, they may feel cornered and become aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1327.016s">And</a> that's why they don't want any fence there. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1328.577s">I</a> think that that's what the sticking point was last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1331.64s">That</a> coupled with the fact that I believe we were stuck <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1335.377s">uh,</a> in a situation where the pox department and the pox commission has a policy that's in place and they weren't willing to make a ruling on it until, uh, some further information was provided to the city of industry, uh, administration relative to, uh, bathroom facilities and the like down to that box. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1351.354s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1533.846s">Madam</a> President, just on that note, I do believe, oh geez, maybe it was three months ago, four months ago, there was an administrative issue, a personnel issue related to our director of IT and the city administration made some personnel moves related to questionable activity or surrounding union involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1560.222s">At</a> the time, they said that the gentleman was removed from his position due to significant security issues surrounding our network. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1566.465s">And</a> this council has asked for an update now two times on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1569.747s">And</a> I'm hoping we can get that information back as well, because this might be a reason why our website's not getting updated, because there's some security issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1576.571s">And</a> we don't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1577.371s">We've</a> asked, but we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1578.692s">And</a> that could be a potential reason as to why we're not seeing our website get updated so frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1582.914s">So</a> I just ask of the city administration, once again, for a third time, to report back to the council on what exactly the security threat or issue was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1709.489s">the</a> city definitely participated in some of our money for design.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1728.3s">It's</a> my understanding that at one point in time, there was some discussion with the local college to do a public-private partnership with Tufts Park and do the whole entire field with AstroTurf and <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=1737.935s">a</a> clubhouse and everything, but it's out of administration testing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2517.182s">We</a> never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2517.742s">No,</a> because last time Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2521.803s">Nazarian</a> came up and said, you know, I'm very confident, and so is KP Law, that we've complied with the provisions and chapters outlined in the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2529.804s">And</a> I said, well, when are we going to get the response? <a href="https://youtu.be/fy-aPUScOL4&t=2531.184s">And</a> she said, it's going to be coming.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_8wk16vmZ3c0/2024-11-18_8wk16vmZ3c0.html">City Council 05-24-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=41.992s">Madam</a> President, I find the records in order and I move for their approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=446.806s">Councilor</a> Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=449.487s">Mr.</a> Mookie is one of the best department heads, I've had the pleasure of working with, and I've worked with department heads all across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as representative for union employees in a municipal setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=461.994s">And</a> my relationship with Mr. Mookie over the years has grown to a friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=466.296s">He's</a> someone that I respect, someone that I admire, someone who, as Councilor Caraviello said, brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=473.487s">When</a> you think about 38 years, that's a pretty long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=477.228s">When</a> you look at the city, look at the community, you see what's happened over that 38 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=482.35s">Anytime</a> there was a shovel on the ground, Mr. Moki was there to make sure that it was done the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=487.632s">That</a> includes the new schools, stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=490.674s">It</a> includes Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=495.035s">It</a> includes the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=497.636s">It</a> includes the field of dreams. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=500.917s">It</a> includes the turfing of Fort Melton. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=503.173s">So</a> when you think about the impact that he's had on this community over 38 years, that impact is going to last well, well, well, well into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=511.916s">These</a> are things that have made our community great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=513.737s">And</a> he's someone that had a hand in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=515.718s">When</a> you talk about his style as a department head and the way that he runs his department, I think it's safe to say that that is the only department in city hall where every employee is cross-trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=524.401s">Where</a> every inspector can be a code enforcement officer and every code enforcement officer can be an inspector. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=528.862s">And</a> when someone's out, they don't miss a beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=531.631s">That's</a> a testament to the vision that Mr. Mookie has, and how this is supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=537.874s">I've</a> always said that the building department here in the city of Medford is a team, and they work very well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=544.958s">And</a> Mr. Mookie just happens to be the person that's driving the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=548.279s">And</a> when we talk about institutional knowledge being lost, that's always a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=552.441s">But</a> I think that Paul's done a great job cultivating talent in his office as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=556.503s">So</a> I look forward to seeing the next generation of leaders coming out of the building department here to work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=563.608s">But</a> this is about Paul and all that he's done for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=566.33s">He's</a> a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=567.11s">He's</a> someone I've had the opportunity to speak with a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=569.712s">I've</a> had the opportunity to sit down with a number of times and enjoy his company and his conversation in a professional setting as well as in a personal, private setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=577.217s">He's</a> someone that I will certainly miss and I thank him for all that he's done for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=580.799s">And</a> I second Councilor Scarpelli's motion to invite him down for citation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=755.411s">Madam</a> President, can I speak to the debate that Councilor Bears and I had? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=758.653s">Go</a> ahead, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=761.914s">It</a> was very persuasive.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=848.598s">Last</a> week we sat here with our city engineer and our director of DPW and they talked about a need for certain equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=855.038s">to</a> take certain functions in-house, that being grinding of stumps and the shaving down of sidewalks that are in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=861.259s">Annually,</a> this council normally appropriates anywhere between a million to $1.5 million for sidewalk repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=868.061s">We</a> also talk every year about whether or not we could handle this in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=871.582s">Earlier</a> this evening, we talked about our budget priorities, and one of our budget priorities would be increasing the staffing level at the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=877.806s">And</a> in partnership or concert with that, I think it would make sense for us to also increase the equipment that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=882.89s">So</a> they get some of this work that is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=885.251s">As</a> we said earlier in the day, the function of government is to provide services and we need boots on the ground in order to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=890.515s">We</a> also need equipment to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=892.216s">So</a> this is a request that the administration price out with this piece of equipment or cost that the city engineer and the city public works director was speaking up and to present it to the council for either inclusion in the capital plan or for a supplemental appropriation request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1780.867s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1782.489s">This</a> has been a topic of much debate and as evident by future governor Healy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1789.749s">lawsuits,</a> also legal proceedings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1792.731s">And</a> it's really the age old argument of, you know, is this an employer, an employee or a contractor? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1798.274s">And,</a> you know, when I think about this, I think about it in the simplest terms, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1801.776s">I</a> mean, I've called Lyft before a bunch of times, I've called Uber a bunch of times, I've never called Joe the driver. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1809.341s">I've</a> called Uber and Uber has sent me a driver, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1813.162s">So,</a> you know, it's really employee misclassification, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1816.843s">You</a> know, Uber, Lyft, these ride share hailing companies, you know, they have the control, the direction of the employee and anything the employee does is really in the furtherance of Uber and Lyft's name, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1827.465s">It's</a> in their interest, it's in furtherance of the employer's interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1830.626s">That's</a> a three-part test to determine whether or not you're a Councilor or an employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1835.047s">I</a> mean, I'm sorry, contractor and employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1837.368s">So,</a> you know, when you look at what's going on, it's clear that these companies are taking advantage of workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1843.592s">They're</a> doing it through, like Councilor Caraviello said, vehicle leasing programs and financial lending programs that are making these individuals, quite frankly, financially bound to these organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1852.577s">So</a> if they wanted to leave, they wouldn't even be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1855.679s">You</a> know, so when you look at this and you sit back and you say, what's right is right, what's right is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1862.449s">The,</a> the way that they're classifying people the amount of money that they're putting into this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1866.671s">It's</a> ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1867.371s">It's</a> absolutely ridiculous and just shows you there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1869.852s">I</a> haven't seen this since what was the last one with a right to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1873.594s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1875.115s">Millions</a> and millions of dollars are going into this to fight something. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1878.116s">Why,</a> because it's good for the working person that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1881.458s">And</a> what we're seeing this console concept is this is the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1885.247s">in</a> an effort to eliminate workers' rights and workers' benefits, so that big business doesn't have to be on the hook for these liabilities, and so that individuals are going to be tasked with the responsibility of planning for their own retirement, their own future, because they're not paying into Social Security, because they're not paying into healthcare, and at the end of the run, <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1905.053s">we're</a> going to see a situation where we have a lot of people that are going to need more from government. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1910.255s">So</a> this is actually a policy I think that's going to make sense because it's going to protect us economically it's going to protect that name is going to protect the residents of this community, and it's going to prevent big business from taking advantage the little guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=1921.539s">So</a> I support this whole heartedly and I think the council put it on the agenda this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2125.856s">Madam</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2129.043s">Actually,</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2130.964s">I</a> recall getting a correspondence from the administration at some point saying that they stopped the construction on the episodes project because they wanted to make sure that the condensate con and shell was accessible for the summer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=2155.532s">I'm</a> just trying to look it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3405.426s">I'm</a> just Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3407.268s">If</a> in fact, we are going to be sending a letter right past that that letter come out of the Committee of the whole subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3413.874s">That's</a> the only question I have but I support them out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8wk16vmZ3c0&t=3666.446s">It's</a> 60,000.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=32.215s">Madam</a> President, motion to suspend the rules.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=39.098s">That</a> is correct, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=40.099s">I'd</a> like to take the last paper on the agenda out of order for this evening, paper 22356, a request for an expenditure from the law department.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=156.433s">The</a> only reason I ask is because we're the clerks and employee of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=161.798s">When</a> we need to invoke the rule of necessity to properly appropriate the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=171.315s">concerned</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=172.995s">But</a> I certainly have no problem proving the funds and gentleman had a switch back up into his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=177.556s">I</a> certainly warranted remediation questions whether or not how we take the vote, we take the vote is a straight roll call vote as we usually do it, we have to invoke the rule of necessity, or does it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=192.04s">Because</a> the city solicitor has not provided us with an opinion, it does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=195.801s">It</a> doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=197.421s">So</a> just like to be on the record, you know, I raised the issue
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=799.396s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=800.657s">I</a> know that there are a number of DCI-owned properties that have service contracts with the city, where the city is afforded the opportunity to maintain and upkeep certain properties, one of those being the Condon Shelves, Councilor Caraviello was speaking of down at the sleeping hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=815.182s">So</a> I just ask that as part of this paper that we get a copy of all the service and maintenance agreements that we have with the DCI, so we know who's responsible for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=822.025s">Ultimately,</a> it is the DC has land, but the city in the past has signed on to be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of certain houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=828.428s">So</a> for us to make an informed decision, I think we need to know what fossils those are, and whether or not those agreements still exist, and whether or not they need to be maybe beefed up a little bit to get us what community needs and benefits necessary to protect this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1185.865s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1265.301s">Madam</a> President, I just asked that this paper also be sent to the Director of Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1268.482s">I</a> know the Recreation Department's been expanding their programming related to blotchy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1273.704s">If</a> you look at the Recreation booklet, you'll see that they have pickup games, I guess is what you want to call it, of blotchy down there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1280.826s">So</a> I think this is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1282.687s">the</a> recreation department's really trying to take a look at investing some energy and effort into and having the state of the art quality facilities is what's going to really increase participation, I think, so I think it's a great measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1294.394s">The</a> budget quotes are something I was always very supportive of. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=1296.475s">I</a> was the sponsor of the initial resolve under the Burke administration that brought these to fruition, and Councilor Caraviello is right, the specs are not up to community standards.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=2709.585s">six</a> to eight weeks, it's July.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3180.991s">I</a> don't think it was intentional.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3188.013s">Does</a> the city replace sidewalks on private ways?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3208.653s">I</a> don't think it's... How about if we make it a yes or no question?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3224.968s">So</a> the intention would be, I guess, moving forward, the city would be moving away from paving private ways, the sidewalks are private ways.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3309.106s">In</a> this map with the 1700, or the 2100 sidewalk panels, <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3319.532s">Does</a> this include private waste in this assessment?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3322.313s">Does</a> not include private waste?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3335.46s">And</a> percentage wise, number of public waste versus private waste that we have in this community?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3344.485s">There's</a> a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3344.845s">Yes,</a> there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3354.692s">So,</a> in essence, there would be a third of the streets in this community, if we expend these funds, that would receive no benefit from it, regardless of when we do it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3363.098s">Because</a> we're not gonna be paying for private sidewalks going forward for right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3367.161s">If</a> they're issued as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3381.532s">There's</a> a community benefit, yeah, but as the person that's said, I'm on the list for 11 years, and then you say it's private way, you're going to be on the list for another 11 years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3417.964s">And</a> if somebody resides in a private way and they want to replace the sidewalk in front of the house, can they do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3422.307s">All</a> they have to do is pull a permit from you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3423.948s">It's</a> not our problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3425.229s">They</a> can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3425.669s">Do</a> they even have to pull a permit from you guys?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3483.695s">We</a> have no real assessment on a third of the streets, just with the condition that there's about a third of the streets that are private ways in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3490.219s">We</a> did no assessment on those Starbucks whatsoever.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3495.342s">Not</a> the formal assessment, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3496.763s">I</a> like this approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3497.443s">I</a> think that this is very helpful, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3499.124s">It</a> looks like we're going to get more bang for our buck, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3501.105s">Ultimately,</a> it's like the sneakers that we're wearing most of the rubber off of are the ones we're going to replace, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3508.89s">Yes,</a> I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3510.051s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3510.831s">We're</a> getting bang for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3512.792s">you</a> know, methodology, which we haven't seen in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3514.853s">It's</a> something I've been calling for for a long time, you know, so I appreciate what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3518.696s">I</a> think that we need to really take a look at how we handle private ways in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3523.038s">It's</a> not like they pay less taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3524.699s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3525.9s">In</a> some most instances, they pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3529.142s">So</a> when you look at the streets that are private ways and the homes that are on them, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3534.106s">Bigger</a> houses, bigger lots and the like, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3536.568s">So</a> we need to wrap our heads around this because the taxpayers in this community should receive the same services regardless of whether or not this street has been publicly or privately accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3544.975s">You</a> know, that's legal mumbo-jumbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3546.517s">The</a> regular citizen in this community doesn't care about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3549.479s">Right,</a> what they care about is the fact that Councilor Bears said, we can disagree on just about everything in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3554.663s">The</a> one thing we all agree on is our roads and sidewalks are in bad shape and we need to invest in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3558.927s">All</a> right, I'm happy to spend this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3561.369s">I</a> wish there was another zero at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3563.352s">Right,</a> and I know you guys do too, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3565.353s">Ultimately,</a> at the end of the day, I know you guys do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3567.915s">In</a> the future, I'm going to call for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3569.636s">We</a> can start really looking at talking about this private way stuff because, you know, I think that it really needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3576.36s">But,</a> you know, you guys did a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3577.801s">I</a> appreciate your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3578.822s">Welcome</a> aboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3579.783s">Congratulations</a> on your new appointment, maybe permanency. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3582.504s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3583.145s">You've</a> done a good job and you've proved it, you know what I mean, time and time again when you come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3586.087s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3587.888s">I</a> appreciate your honesty and openness in answering the questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3610.945s">I</a> don't know if you know the answer to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3612.586s">Does</a> accepting more public ways increase our eligibility or benefits for funding through the state house, maybe?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3629.031s">Right,</a> but if we turn these private ways into public ways, do we get more money too?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3663.76s">There's</a> a process, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3691.152s">You</a> got to get seven, you got to get four here to agree to the five here to agree to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3694.974s">So</a> that's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3695.694s">So</a> I have to stay where you're coming from.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3718.063s">Well,</a> let's forget about that until I bring it up later on, because I think we're getting way off track. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3721.624s">No</a> problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3942.853s">I</a> don't remember the policy at one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=3945.054s">Same</a> thing where all the neighbors chipped in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XA7wYJ4TI4w&t=4303.643s">Madam</a> President, I move for approval of paper 22317 and 22318.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg/2024-11-18_Blp3jbNtrXg.html">City Council 05-10-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=292.337s">Madam</a> President, looking at this application is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=295.06s">There</a> are a couple things that I'd like to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=297.161s">First</a> of all, there was no place in the city of Medford at 11 o'clock at night we get a good cookie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=301.385s">So</a> this is certainly a need that we have here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=303.967s">Second,</a> when you look at the application is before us, the gentleman's only asking for Fridays and Saturdays, it's only asking for one additional hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=310.933s">You</a> know, I think this is really. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=313.375s">He's</a> not asking for much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=314.677s">It's</a> a brand new business, it's been very successful, a lot of talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=317.76s">From</a> what I understand, a state representative has already broken the record for the most crumbled points that you can get in a month or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=326.35s">But</a> in all seriousness, I think this is a good proposal that's before us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=331.476s">I</a> just ask that the <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=333.723s">license</a> go with the business and not the address should it be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=337.624s">And</a> I'd be happy to motion for approval of the papers before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=340.645s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=601.406s">I</a> have no problem voting for this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=603.367s">He</a> answers one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=605.449s">When</a> is El Tecuba going to open? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=612.215s">We've</a> been waiting eight years for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=613.476s">We're</a> only waiting four for you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=709.438s">I</a> can't answer that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=712.819s">We</a> need your common fix license to go apply for the liquor commission to get your liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=716.52s">Then</a> you get your liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=717.721s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=741.374s">For</a> 11 to 1, even if they lick the licenses to 1 AM at the state level, you have to come back to us for the extended hours permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=748.278s">So</a> if there's any opportunity for us to further vet this, it's going to be coming before us, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=753.78s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=754.04s">I</a> don't see this being harmful, but I would defer to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=759.703s">Or</a> I'll make a motion to remove approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2029.916s">Madam</a> President, I think it was my father that told me this a long time ago 90% of life is showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2037.603s">I</a> mean, how can we put somebody in the election commission as a vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2042.584s">It's</a> crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2044.405s">So</a> it's pretty much, I never did this before, but now I want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2046.906s">So</a> put me on a commission and we have a line of people that have participated every day that want to be vocal members of our community and vocal members of boards and commissions that get bypassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2055.028s">I</a> don't think she's a good candidate just based upon the fact that she's seeking a job on the election commission and doesn't vote locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2061.81s">And</a> it's a local appointment to a local board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2065.091s">It</a> doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2066.853s">Doesn't</a> make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2069.756s">I</a> mean, I'm sure that she's a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2073.399s">I</a> Councilor Tseng said that, you know, the people in our boards of commission should look like the people live in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2078.524s">I</a> don't know what this mommy looks like because I've never seen her before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2082.088s">Since</a> this application has come in, I've never seen or heard from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2084.45s">I've</a> never gotten asked if I have any questions about her. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2086.873s">She's</a> never reached out to me and said, I'd like your vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2089.075s">Do</a> you have any concerns or questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2091.197s">I've</a> never got any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2093.209s">which</a> is normal practice when you have an applicant that comes before this board, they usually reach out to you and ask for your vote, and they ask if they have any questions or concerns before this type of event happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2102.536s">So</a> I, as one Councilor, can't support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2104.698s">Like</a> I said, 90% of life is showing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2107.04s">It</a> takes 30 seconds to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2109.962s">It</a> takes 30 seconds to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2111.303s">How</a> can you go from not voting to saying, I want to be an elections commissioner? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2113.965s">It</a> takes 30 seconds to do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2264.783s">Madam</a> President, voting is your voice, but voting also shows that you're invested in the community that you live in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2333.916s">I'm</a> president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2334.516s">I</a> understand this because I have a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2335.736s">I</a> have two kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=2336.897s">I</a> have actually three jobs and two kids, but I still go out and vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3185.838s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3187.239s">I</a> agree with all my colleagues, and I think that's why last term, this council voted to pass the ordinance to promote prevent and support behavioral health and establish a commission to do all these things that this ordinance before this proposal before us this evening is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3202.13s">If</a> we look at that ordinance that was passed on three to 21 and established a series of goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3206.914s">One</a> of those goals was to set community wide goals to create a strategic plan <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3212.257s">achieving</a> mental well being for all of that residents, and I think that that's really what speaks with this paper speaks to this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3217.983s">Also,</a> we look at the composition of this commission will see that it has the director of the Board of Health, the police chief or his designee the fire chief or his designee superintendent of schools or a designee, the manager of prevention and outreach the director of diversity, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3232.812s">The</a> director of the senior center the director of veterans services or a designee designees from our EMS provider, the director of school counseling and behavioral health behavioral health specialist from Tufts, a behavioral health health specialist from Lawrence Mural Hospital, and three community members appointed by the map. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3248.321s">So</a> it's clear, Madam President, when this paper first came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3252.029s">We</a> as a body made sure that there was more of a focus on the students in our schools and the young people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3258.932s">If</a> you remember what the first paper looked like when Mayor Burke put the paper out, Madam President, I did a little bit of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3264.795s">And</a> through the subcommittee and committee process, actually, we were able to meet on a number of occasions and really hash out the details in this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3274.279s">And</a> we came up with a nice document here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3276.28s">And</a> quite frankly, if you're looking for what Councilor Tseng's asking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3280.692s">And</a> what this ordinance calls for, it's the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3283.833s">And</a> where this matter passed on 3-2-21, and the commission is required to file an annual report with the mayor and the city clerk, it looks like probably within the next 60 days, we should be seeing what their annual report says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3296.218s">So</a> that's something I'm looking forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=3297.538s">I'd</a> just like to amend the paper and add that as a request that the administration provide us with a copy of the behavioral health commission's annual report, whereas the commission has been up and running now for a period of about 14, 15 months.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4119.717s">President</a> for me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4122.237s">This</a> application is before us is endorsed by our superintendent lines, who in my opinion is probably one of the best department heads that we have here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4131.416s">Mr.</a> Randazzo does an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4133.297s">He's</a> done a great job with his budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4134.618s">He's</a> been able to cut his budget by about $400,000 when we transferred two LED lights and took over the maintenance of our streetlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4141.984s">He's</a> quite a department head and he's laid out a pretty nice plan there from what I can see in the application that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4147.889s">You</a> know, when we look at this stretch of area, for probably the better part of the last five years, the residents in this neighborhood, and I know you wouldn't know anything about this, Madam President, at all, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4159.885s">have</a> had to deal with the Eversource project and have had to deal with the blasting project for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4165.61s">The</a> conditions of the Eversource project call for significant restorations and sidewalk installation at Lorraine Road and Winthrop Street, as well as curb-to-curb paving for the whole stretch of Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4178.239s">Coordination</a> of these projects is key in order for us to make sure that when we get curb-to-curb paving, five days later, we don't have an application for someone to have a granite location for a ground opening to come in <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4189.073s">and</a> say we need to go and lay these telephone wires down now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4192.157s">So</a> I think it's in our best interest to conditionally approve this paper right now so that the city engineer's office can coordinate with Eversource because, you know, it's only been like half a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4202.169s">So</a> this project should be almost done, you know, maybe before, you know, 2029 or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4207.756s">But</a> ultimately, you know, in placing my trust in the department head that we have here, Mr. Medazzo, and also looking at the circumstances that are before us and the damage that could be done should this grant location not be offered, I think a conditional permit is warranted at this point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4720.004s">Madam</a> president. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4720.444s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4721.465s">Um,</a> in my time on this council for about nine years now, um, I think we've had some great successes and I'm very proud of my track record and the track record that, um, when we've been able to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4733.053s">the</a> things we've been able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4735.334s">When</a> I look at our accomplishments and I look at the good work that we've done in the building of consensus on issues that impact our community, it always happens when we go through the process and we properly vet the process through the subcommittee and the committee of the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4746.98s">And</a> I think that that's really where our time is best spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4750.462s">So</a> when we talk about what our most successful endeavors have been, we talk about inclusionary zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4757.266s">We</a> talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4758.487s">recartification</a> of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4760.307s">We</a> talk about breweries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4762.728s">We</a> talk about the library, the new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4766.469s">We</a> talk about the responsible employer ordinance, the wage theft ordinance, the science labs and the media center at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4773.37s">The</a> list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4775.591s">All</a> that work was an idea that started on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4779.271s">And</a> then it went through a very open, deliberate public process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4783.272s">And</a> during that public process is where the progress was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4786.853s">During</a> that <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4787.93s">public</a> process and that vetting process in the subcommittee where we actually rolled up our sleeves and tackled the issue that was before us, we were able to produce great results. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4798.739s">When</a> the administration buys in and gives us the tools in the toolbox, when they give us a lawyer, we've done amazing work, amazing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4807.586s">And</a> it's all come through the subcommittee or the committee of the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4811.85s">So</a> when we look at our successes, we look at the Stanley cup and we see <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4816.598s">the</a> names that are registered on it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4818.679s">The</a> names that are registered on it are all the issues that have come through this proper vetting process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4824.22s">And</a> quite frankly, I find that my time is far better spent in a subcommittee meeting or a committee of the whole than it is behind the rail on a Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4831.942s">Because</a> we're not tackling issues behind the rail on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4835.783s">We're</a> raising issues, we're throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and then we're kicking it across the hall to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4842.805s">But</a> when we own an issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4844.644s">and</a> we take it from the subcommittee to the committee of the whole and back to the floor, we make a difference in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4849.688s">And</a> the track record shows it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4852.13s">So</a> I'm gonna say right now, Councilor Caraviello has asked for this West Medford revitalization group. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4859.617s">And</a> he kicked it across, we've kicked it across all to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4861.979s">We</a> said the mayor put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4865.042s">Last</a> week, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances, the subcommittee on ordinances met to establish a beautification committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4871.475s">And</a> we're gonna pass it and we're gonna own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4873.615s">And</a> we're gonna send it to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4875.036s">The</a> mayor's either gonna sign it or she's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4878.196s">She's</a> gonna veto it and send it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4879.756s">And</a> then it's up to us to decide whether or not we wanna override it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4883.257s">But</a> we're gonna own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4884.797s">And</a> we're gonna say, we're not happy with the curb appeal in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4887.818s">So</a> we're putting together a beautification committee because we own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4891.418s">And</a> we've been able to do that because we've gone through this vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4895.059s">And</a> quite frankly, again, my experience tells me my time is best spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4901.455s">in</a> the attack on the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4903.256s">And</a> the reason I say that is because we have a work product to speak for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4907.119s">So</a> Madam President I, my two closest friends on the council my two closest to my closest friends in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4912.363s">I've</a> worked with George and john I mean George and Rick for a number of years, and I've known them my whole life, right, I disagree with them on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4920.088s">And</a> the reason I disagree is because I feel like our best work is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4923.77s">When</a> we're in there with our sleeves rolled up, when we're not choked up with the tie all the way around our necks, choking ourselves, worrying about what's going on in the camera, we're worrying about what's going on the issue right in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4936.154s">We've</a> done that work and we've managed to meet every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4939.416s">And</a> imagine how much more work we could get done if we were better utilizing our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4942.797s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4959.32s">After</a> they pull them after they pull after they pull the membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4962.842s">Because</a> meeting for the sake of meeting isn't accomplishing anything not a second meeting if it's for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4970.687s">To</a> do what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=4971.668s">To</a> discuss the items on the agenda?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5909.451s">I</a> mean, it's just hard to understand information Council night, there's been a paper asking to reduce the number of council meetings to three per month that laid on the table for I have to say since 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5918.997s">But</a> it's never been discussed though it's not like this came out of the blue, this is something that's been discussed there's been there was a rules reform paper that came up previously.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5936.107s">So</a> the question now, pardon me, until now, it's made it out of subcommittee and it's made, so it's made it out of subcommittee now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5970.381s">But</a> when we did it before, Adam, it was we met every single Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5975.663s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5976.083s">But</a> we still had subcommittee structure, Bob, and we went through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5979.504s">We</a> still went through polling membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5981.064s">What's</a> your schedule reflect? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5982.104s">And</a> when can we do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5982.765s">All</a> this is a minor scheduling issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5984.405s">So</a> turn this into like, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=5986.526s">It's</a> the end of the world or something, because you can't come down here and scream every every Tuesday instead every other Tuesday.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6007.071s">And</a> if you have to wait every other week so much of an emergency that you're waiting for a Tuesday night to come here then there's something wrong, there's something really wrong with government.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6085.184s">Not</a> from us to the administration and back.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6825.648s">That's</a> personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6826.608s">Can't</a> tell that one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6927.766s">Mr.</a> Phillips, thank you for checking in this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6931.468s">It</a> suggests that you might give the superintendent of schools a call and let her know what a great job her athletic department is doing and her team over there at the community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6938.891s">Bobby</a> Maloney, our athletic director, Rachel Perry, our assistant athletic director, <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6942.79s">Our</a> ACEs, they do a great job for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6944.33s">And</a> I know that the superintendent would love to hear that they did such a great job and what an impact that having the pool open for you meant to you during the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=6954.132s">So</a> if you could do that, I think that'd be a nice feather in Bobby and Rachel's cap as well as the rest of the staff over there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7039.733s">Council</a> night was a borrowing paper I believe requires three readings only reading the paper is going to come back to this council for further discussion and debate, because the bar paper so requires a third reading before the money gets.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7095.589s">It's</a> my understanding we lost the sidewalk contract last year because we couldn't get them to go out right so we appropriated the funds and the money went. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7102.791s">I</a> don't think we ever spent the money from last year sidewalks, because it's not carried over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7108.122s">Mr.</a> Karen's was talking about how the construction market was hot and JD DiRenzo wasn't able to come out and perform the work and they will be contracted with, if I'm not mistaken, but I don't, I mean, we have a, we have a DPW commissioner now right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7124.173s">Tim.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7124.493s">Oh,</a> it's Tim McGibbon, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Blp3jbNtrXg&t=7126.254s">They</a> shuffle around so much over there, I can't figure it out.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_c8iEJdtrmLE/2024-11-18_c8iEJdtrmLE.html">City Council 04-26-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=154.1s">Madam</a> President, based upon the review of the paperwork, I see no issue or problem with this, and I would certainly move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=159.324s">We</a> all know that the CPA application is a lengthy process that's properly vetted by at least nine members of our community that serve on various boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=167.73s">We've</a> all spoken in favor of how much we support the Chevalier Auditorium and how much we want to see this auditorium be the economic driver in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=175.873s">I</a> think facade improvements is something that we've all spoke about in the past I think this is something that I support wholeheartedly and I'm sure that my colleagues do as well, and I'll certainly move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=361.939s">Madam</a> President is a member of this fund I am very grateful that the board has moved in its divine wisdom to make this cost of living adjustment applicable to more members in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=373.102s">Ultimately,</a> when we think about these individuals that are receiving these benefits, these are the people that are the ones that made our city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=378.063s">These</a> are the ones that worked for 30 plus years dedicating their lives to public service so the metric could be the city that it is or once was. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=385.065s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the retirement board for their efforts I think Mr. Jordan and Mr. Minerva especially, and I will move approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=565.736s">Yes,</a> I'm just wondering if you could give us a breakdown as to what our unfunded pension liability is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=576.163s">Yep,</a> so the percentage is what our percentages of the even if that makes it easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=580.606s">We're</a> at 64% funded 64% funded and do I know we were we were on a, we were at a great clip to comply with the directives to, you know, make ourselves so sustainable and fully funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=595.175s">Are</a> we still on track or has the second recession set us back a little bit in that regard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=621.913s">2040.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=622.914s">So</a> we're seven years ahead of schedule.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=632.212s">Excellent</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=632.953s">Excellent</a> work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=633.493s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=826.239s">No,</a> just refer to a committee of the whole Madam President to interview the applicant.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=951.468s">Well</a> my motion would be to have a committee of the whole to meet with the applicant to see who they are I appreciate the work that Sandy's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=958.172s">I</a> glad that the administration finally stopped sitting on their hands after the primary election of last year to come around and start appointing people to these boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=967.797s">Ultimately,</a> we're in a position now we're up against a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=971.019s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=971.319s">We're</a> up against a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=973.519s">We</a> don't have anybody that can even approve nomination papers for candidates that are running for state office right now in our community, because since September of 2021, the administration hasn't acted on vacancies that are in the registrar's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=984.585s">So</a> much so that this council had moved to change the format of our elections office to establish an election commission from a board of registrars of voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=994.49s">So</a> it's very frustrating to be put in this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=998.12s">I</a> remember when I sat in that chair next to me a long ago when I had this was almost a quote that she'd say you know how can you give us something today and expect us to vote on it with no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1007.345s">I</a> appreciate what Sandy's done in the office and I also appreciate what she has to say but this candidate has not fully been vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1013.188s">The</a> reason this candidate has not been fully vetted is because it requires Council approval, and the Council hasn't approved this candidate, and that is the vetting process that is the check and balance that we have for right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1024.295s">That</a> is the advice and consent process that's established <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1027.489s">when</a> we establish one of these elections commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1030.251s">So</a> my theory and my feeling would be that each one of these individuals should be put through a committee of the whole process, where we get to interview them, ask them some questions, talk to them and feel comfortable with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1040.299s">Because</a> ultimately, we want someone that's going to be impartial, someone that's not going to bring politics into the game, someone that's going to act in the best interest of this community and not as an activist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1048.185s">And</a> those are things that you really can't find out unless you talk to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1051.407s">So</a> those are my concerns with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1052.508s">And</a> that's why I call for a committee of the whole, I'd let my motion rest on the table and hope a colleague would second it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1095.588s">So</a> in that point, if there's no hurry, then let's have the committee of the whole, it sounds good to me, I like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1101.049s">We're</a> not behind the eight ball and we're in a good spot, then let's vet this properly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1117.497s">Yes,</a> yes, I was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1118.398s">I</a> had a child care issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1120.318s">Um,</a> was not able to make the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1121.579s">You're</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1129.001s">Not</a> to say that the motion would have been the same had I been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1132.102s">It</a> just, uh, the motion's gone and seconded so we can move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1267.663s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1271.225s">Is</a> there any particular information that we'd like to request from the administration prior to us tabling this paper so that they're aware that there's something in particular that we're looking for whether it's just a resume a CV letter of support from the mayor, or whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1283.131s">I</a> think, do we want the applicant to attend the meeting, or would a resume suffice do we want the applicant to attend with a resume.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1342.578s">I'd</a> just like to add a copy of the application as well then Madam President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1536.526s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1538.027s">Charles</a> Shannon was a mentor of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1539.589s">I</a> had the opportunity to work for him from 1999 until his untimely passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1544.432s">He</a> was a United States Army veteran, a retired police officer, and a Massachusetts state senator. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1551.298s">He</a> had over 50 years of government service to this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the United States of America, and also the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1558.584s">And</a> there are many things that Charlie did in his tenure as the <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1564.052s">Massachusetts</a> State Senator representing Medford, such as supporting marriage equality, supporting universal health care, supporting the extension of the Green Line, which we're now seeing 17 years after his passing finally come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1575.961s">These</a> are many of the items that Charlie worked on that he helped put in motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1579.644s">Not</a> only that, he was one of the most prolific constituent service senators in the state legislature during his tenure there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1587.409s">He</a> was someone that never left anybody behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1589.491s">I</a> had the opportunity to work for him with Councilor Caraviello's son for a summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1594.192s">Council</a> marks former Council marks was a staff member and Senator Shannon's office as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1599.354s">He</a> was just a great mentor to many people and a great friend to many, but also he was a great representative for this community in Medford in the state legislature he always delivered for us when it was time to deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1610.018s">And</a> if you go down to Shannon Beach in Winchester Medford line, you'll see that that was renamed in his honor, recognizing some of the achievements that he's done in the town of Winchester where he <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1621.347s">But</a> Charlie was a great friend he passed away 17 years ago and I hope it's important that everybody recognizes the work that he's done and that we keep his memory alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1630.172s">As</a> we continue to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1631.853s">People</a> have always said that someone has always done a better, better than we have before us and Senator Shannon was one of those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1637.476s">I</a> hold myself with great pride, having the opportunity to work with them in great humility, having the ability to recognize that I could ever fill his shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1645.641s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this measure and <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1649.227s">uh,</a> dedicating this meeting to him and having a moment of silence, uh, to recognize all the work that he did on behalf of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1654.129s">Uh,</a> he passed away of a very public battle with cancer, uh, over three terms as a state Senator. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1659.45s">Um,</a> the Senator battled cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1661.591s">I</a> remember going to his, uh, hospital room at the Dana Faba, bringing him the. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1668.613s">State</a> Senate calendar and, uh, working with him while he was in isolation because he was having, um, bone marrow transplants while he was still going to work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1676.937s">I</a> mean, that's just the type of person he was. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1678.338s">He</a> was very dedicated to this community and to his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1681.16s">He</a> did his best to never miss a vote while he sat there and battled his illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1686.063s">So</a> it's something that was really amazing to watch, to see how much he loved serving the public and how much he loved fighting for those that were in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1695.469s">And</a> it's something that we should all really aspire to. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1698.431s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2624.961s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2627.003s">Mr.</a> Harrington thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2628.904s">I</a> do believe when you were given your presentation I heard you say that you spoke with the mayor and the chief of staff and they suggested that they wanted to do this outside of the bid process is that correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2654.295s">Right,</a> so that would, so what's the, I guess the question is, I mean, anything needs to, any contractor, but I think it's 10 to any, any pervading some services over $10,000, I believe would require it to go out to public bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2669.265s">So</a> it sounds to me like we're getting this done for far less than $10,000.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2684.318s">And</a> where did the funding come from?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2696.985s">Okay,</a> so you took it out of your operating funds that have already been appropriated?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2701.608s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2702.668s">And</a> moving forward for room 207, I mean for room 201 and for the console chambers, what price tag do you think would be attached to that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2769.653s">with</a> me on you tell me, I'm not familiar with who Teresa the point is that you development sustainability, I believe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2779.262s">Did</a> you say it community development.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2785.348s">We</a> must be more like an IT when this won't be more of an IT function than community development.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2832.037s">So,</a> Oh, no, no, I'm not saying it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2834.218s">I'm</a> just a little confused as to why we're paying somebody in the planning department to do an it department job or a job that you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2841.022s">But</a> that's a whole different ball away. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2842.802s">That's</a> all different. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2843.402s">That's</a> an administrative issue that has nothing to do with you or the work that you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2846.963s">Ultimately,</a> you say these things and I just go, huh, I don't know what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2849.944s">I</a> just know that if you're going to make it work, it'll work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2852.824s">But</a> it seems like based upon these methodologies, the way that they're going to work is it's really going to be user driven interface, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2857.925s">So</a> the chairman of the meeting, it's only going to be as successful as the chairperson of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2863.146s">So</a> I would suggest then that the administration implement some type of mandatory training process for the chairs of <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2870.722s">their</a> boards and commissions that are going to be responsible for this, so that they can do it without a hitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2875.725s">Ultimately,</a> if you have you know 20 somewhat boards and commissions and this responsibility is going to fall on the chair of each. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2881.789s">I</a> think that some training module on methodology should be put in place so that everybody comes in with the same sense of comfort and understanding as to how this works, so that the public isn't the one that's the side that suffers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2941.398s">And</a> I would also recommend that one computer be used for each board and commission as opposed to individuals bringing their own <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2950.822s">individuals</a> using different different computers if we can have one computer in each workstation where each border commission has their own dedicated login I think that will cover pretty much the same concerns that we have but we have the, the, the ability to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2964.513s">I</a> just think that we need to make it streamlining consistent across the board that sounds like you're on top of it Kevin so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2974.79s">Amendments,</a> recommendations, however you want to put them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2976.872s">We</a> don't necessarily have to vote on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2978.133s">I</a> think Kevin wrote them down and I'm pretty confident in his ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=2980.455s">He's</a> been great since he's been here, so I'm not too worried about it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3636.073s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3637.614s">All</a> this talk about IT starts getting me thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3640.974s">I</a> know back when the mayor's office tried to force our former IT director to resign under the guise of what was said was IT vulnerabilities, and this council asked for a report back from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3656.458s">We</a> never received that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3659.492s">I</a> think that, you know, the termination of a former IT director was more around protected union activity than actual performance on the job, but that's just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3669.415s">But</a> the reasoning that they gave when they terminated our former IT director was that there were IT vulnerabilities here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3675.957s">And</a> at that time, this council had asked for a report back from the administration as to what those vulnerabilities were and what steps they was taking to protect the information that the residents in this community share with their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3687.258s">in</a> the operations of the day-to-day delivery of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3691.699s">And</a> I'd just like to have the paper reset to the administration asking for an update because we've never received a response to that paper as to what these IT vulnerabilities are, what steps are being taken to secure them, and whether or not there will be a request for funding in the future necessary to make us so safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3710.746s">Again,</a> I still question the circumstances of the termination of our former IT director <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3715.274s">He</a> was in the middle of, uh, of organizing members of the administration to join a labor union. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3721.778s">And,</a> um, he was terminated with, uh, really no warning and no progressive discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3727.221s">Uh,</a> so it raises a number of concerns for me, but the administration to give a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3731.004s">And</a> they said the reason was it vulnerabilities and the council still has not received a report on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3735.707s">And</a> that's something that could become very costly to this council in this city in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3739.669s">If</a> in fact there really are. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3741.842s">IT</a> vulnerabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3743.203s">We</a> don't know because we haven't gotten the report, but if we do get a report, then we might be able to position ourselves to figure out how much is it going to cost us in the future when the budget discussions start as to how to address these IT vulnerabilities, along with these other very positive IT issues that are coming along that Kevin's bringing to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=3759.112s">So</a> I'd just like to offer that as a B paper to make sure that the administration responds to the prior paper requesting what the IT vulnerabilities were surrounding the termination of a prior IT director.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4366.865s">Yes,</a> Madam President, one of the many emails I've received about all the wonderful things going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4372.16s">I</a> heard that the administration was putting together a community wide cleanup. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4375.522s">And</a> I would suggest that we forward this resolution to her office and ask that she put this in as part of her community wide cleanup efforts that are coming up in just a few short weeks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4388.15s">Shocking.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=4408.842s">I</a> thought they could do it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_8D6g1gdpE1E/2024-11-18_8D6g1gdpE1E.html">City Council 04-12-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=224.26s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=225.941s">Any</a> of us that have gone through Medford High over the past, I guess, what looks like 50 years will be very familiar with Bill Mazzacca. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=231.866s">He</a> was a security officer there for the last 47 and a half years where we went to school every day during rain, snow, sleet, and hail to protect the children in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=242.614s">But</a> he's always been a great individual, a great public servant, and someone that I've always respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=247.217s">It</a> was very <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=248.618s">interesting</a> when I brought my son up to kids corner for daycare, and I sat there and my son said, Oh, I was talking to Mr. Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=256.364s">And</a> I look over and there's Bill Mosaic, who was Mr. Bill, when I was a student at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=261.667s">But</a> he's just a gentleman who's dedicated his whole life to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=264.93s">Someone</a> who's done great good for the students in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=267.952s">And</a> he's someone that deserves a little bit of recognition for the hard work that he put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=271.134s">He's</a> someone that was always behind the scenes a man of not many words, but great action. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=275.137s">He's</a> someone that the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=276.905s">should</a> be very thankful that they had the opportunity to have for 47 and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=280.468s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I'm asking my colleagues to join me in extending some congratulatory notes to Mr. Mazeka in the momentous occasion of his retirement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1117.635s">I</a> certainly understand that the city of Medford has a very strong Haitian population. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1122.258s">Growing</a> up in this community, I've gone to school and come friends with a number of people that are from Haitian descent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1128.201s">And</a> I certainly have no problem with a commission on the status of citizens of Haitian descent that's being created by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1137.746s">But</a> I've said it before, I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1139.087s">I'm</a> not putting my name on a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1141.375s">going</a> to speak of Mariano or Senate Spelker, unless it's us asking for money for the city, because pretty soon they're going to become tone deaf to the wants and desires of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1152.643s">Um,</a> so for that reason, I'll be voting against this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1155.385s">Um,</a> I certainly support the piece of legislation as a private citizen, but as a member of this body, I don't feel as though it's good practice for us to continue to put our noses into what's going on with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1164.752s">Um,</a> I haven't never gotten a letter from a state delegation telling us to vote a certain way in a resolution that's before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1170.882s">If</a> we want our delegation to come down and present to us and talk to us about some of these pieces of legislation, I think that might be a little bit more productive because, well, Council of Business is pretty well-versed in a lot of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1180.724s">I</a> don't think all of us are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1182.945s">And</a> I think a lot of us would be a little bit more comfortable if maybe we had members of our delegation come down and talk to us, tell us what this bill does and why they're in favor of it or why they're opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1192.127s">And</a> then the council can make a determination as to whether or not we want to encourage our delegation, the people that represent us on Beacon Hill, to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1199.969s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the council for bringing the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1202.37s">And</a> I also thank him for being so up to date and involved in the goings on at Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1207.632s">However,</a> my focus here is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1209.352s">And</a> I think that this council really needs to take a look at what's going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1215.514s">And</a> if we're going to Beacon Hill, well, one thing we need more than anything is money. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1218.395s">So</a> that's what I think we should be asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1220.035s">But</a> I thank the council for the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1569.8s">Madam</a> President, yes, I'll be supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1572.141s">If</a> we remember back to the mistake <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1574.981s">River</a> Watershed Association and the presentation that they made to us several years ago when they were coming to us for some community development block grant funding or CPA funding I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1584.066s">and</a> they were seeking funds to design a shared use path along the Mystic River down to Shannon Beach and then beyond Shannon Beach down to Wedgman Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1593.492s">I</a> think that this is a key link to us bringing that project to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1599.015s">It's</a> gonna allow us to connect the multimodal transportation roadways to the two train stations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1606.1s">So</a> that's gonna be something very beneficial to the communities to split the people out of them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1915.032s">I</a> believe that stretch of roadway is DCR controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1919.455s">The</a> crossing right from Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1922.576s">The</a> crossing is yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1924.057s">I</a> know Councilor Caraviello is going to run for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1926.899s">I</a> know that he's been working with them on the guide rails as well with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=1930.901s">So</a> I think the DCR would have to be involved in doing anything that doesn't cross their road or block their road.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2447.121s">Madam</a> president. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2447.681s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2448.822s">Um,</a> when looking at the language of this, first of all, it looks very much like a rent control bill to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2454.826s">Um,</a> rent stabilization, anti price gouging protection. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2457.788s">Sounds</a> like rent control to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2459.869s">Um,</a> it's a homerun petition and we're going to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2462.231s">We're</a> asking them to let mention create its own laws and make its own specific set of laws for just people live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2468.86s">This</a> is gonna go to the state legislature and it's gonna go right in the circular file. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2472.621s">All</a> right, it's good for show. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2474.881s">In</a> practice, it's never gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2476.562s">We're</a> talking about a regional housing crisis, but each community that we live in is gonna have different rules of application as to how it applies. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2485.723s">I</a> think it's also important that we look at the policies that we adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2489.544s">If</a> we take some blame for the rising cost of housing in our community, when we advocate for the Green Line, <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2498.932s">We</a> know the Green Line brings increased property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2501.953s">When</a> we advocate for the revitalization of Medford Square, and we ask people to present proposals on how we can improve and better our downtowns, we're part of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2513.216s">We're</a> the government, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2514.136s">And</a> we're asking people, how can we revitalize downtown? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2516.917s">Bradley</a> Road's right downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2519.298s">We're</a> saying, let's bring the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2520.458s">Well,</a> we know the Green Line's gonna bring high property values. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2524.359s">We've</a> been waiting 20 years for the Green Line to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2526.917s">We</a> still don't have a parking plan for Ball Square, as we're going to notice if we look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2529.859s">We</a> knew it was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2531.08s">We've</a> known it's been coming for two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2533.922s">We've</a> known it's been coming for two decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2536.624s">We</a> can't address the problems that have followed in our purview and the problems that followed in our scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2541.368s">Is</a> it really reasonable for us to think that we're going to be able to create laws that are different than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that just affect just our community right here that relate to something as large scale as a regional housing crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2554.834s">I</a> don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2555.654s">Personally,</a> I'm going to vote against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2557.515s">And</a> I don't find it reasonable for us to go create rent control locally in one community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2563.458s">I</a> think this is something that does need to be addressed at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2566.439s">If</a> I were a little bit more familiar with these two bills, if I had like a state rep and some staff on my team, and I'd have them research the bills and provide the bill summaries and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2577.625s">But</a> as of right now, I just think that this is nothing more than a, hey, we tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2581.327s">It</a> didn't pass up at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2583.545s">Blame</a> the rep, it's not my fault, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2586.047s">That's</a> what it looks like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2586.967s">It</a> doesn't look like it's rooted in reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2588.808s">I</a> appreciate the gentleman for bringing the issues to the table, and I appreciate the lady for bringing the issues to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2594.872s">But</a> we've seen bills like this filed in other communities, and they've gone nowhere.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2601.977s">I</a> mean, and the reason why they've gone nowhere is because we can't just have one set of rules for Medford, a different set of rules for Somerville, a different set of rules for Allington when it comes to something like housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=2611.606s">When</a> we're trying to go with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and address a regional crisis, we can't have rules that just work in one area and not in another.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3854.111s">At</a> that point, the competition and I think it's important to point out, you know, we're having a very heated debate on an issue that's before us this evening, but there have been other housing related initiatives that have been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3863.597s">And</a> one of those was the creation of the affordable housing trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3866.559s">And</a> that's something I think we're all on the same page with right we want to create an affordable housing trust fund where we can <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3872.928s">create</a> units here in this community that are affordable to create that competition to drive the cost down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3878.23s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3878.39s">So</a> that's something we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3879.791s">We</a> actually have a piece of paper that's been drafted by the administration that we're working on with the administration to bring through the legislative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3887.974s">And</a> that's something that I think we'll see benefits from because when you look at the taxes that you referred to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3893.113s">We</a> also have the Community Preservation Act and part of the CPA is the ability to generate 10% of those funds that we take it from the CPA, which is 1.5% of the total tax roll on and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3905.275s">10%</a> of that goes into the affordable housing bucket for the creation of affordable housing, the retention of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3910.856s">So</a> that gives us an opportunity to begin to start creating units and then hopefully creating competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3917.698s">Unfortunately,</a> I think <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3920.531s">6,000</a> units wish I had something like that according to the, to the governor's MBTA MBTA community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3931.038s">document</a> the municipal modernization bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3933.3s">Um,</a> so, you know, it's going to take a lot of work for us to, to be where we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3938.123s">Um,</a> but I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3938.924s">I</a> think that, you know, competition is really the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3941.105s">Uh,</a> a lot of the times creation of units is what's necessary, how we create these units and where we create these units is late. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3946.389s">Therein</a> lies the rub, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3947.41s">We</a> don't want skyscrapers all over Mr. Gaff, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3950.612s">We</a> want to keep the fabric of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3953.874s">And</a> at the same time also maintain the level of services that we're providing people, which <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3958.041s">isn't</a> great right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3958.982s">And</a> if we have skyscrapers, all of them is to have, I can just imagine the level of services that we're going to get with that influx of people, the traffic and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3966.366s">Um,</a> so I certainly understand me a comment and that was my concern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3970.629s">I</a> feel like some of the stuff is really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3972.69s">The</a> person that owns our two or three family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3974.99s">might</a> have been in the family for three generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3976.891s">And</a> now the children have moved away, but they've inherited the home and they've used it as an income property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3982.533s">And</a> it's something that the family's worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3985.974s">There's</a> also the question of the transfer tax that's been discussed and how you fund these affordable housing funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3990.695s">And</a> the fair share amendment has a transfer tax component to it as well, where you could buy the worst house on the street and live there for 30 years, pull permits every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=3998.565s">get</a> all the work done in the street to make it the nicest house on the street, you're paying an assessment every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4002.609s">And</a> then when you go to sell the house, you have to pay another fee or an assessment to create affordable housing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4006.692s">So</a> there are gonna be trade-offs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4008.353s">And</a> the biggest question is always, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4010.195s">What's</a> the biggest question in everybody's life, right?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4017.581s">But</a> I agree, I think competition is the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=4019.743s">And</a> I thank you for your comments because I think we share a lot of the same concerns.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5040.462s">Madam</a> President, I will not be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5044.604s">I</a> have <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5045.983s">A</a> number of concerns, ultimately, for the last three years, small businesses have been under relatively stringent regulation and oversight I think that we need to let them breathe a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5059.179s">This</a> proposal may have a significant impact on two of the larger employers here in this community, Bianchi Foods and Monogram Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5067.447s">Both</a> of those individual employers we've entered into tax deferred agreements with. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5071.792s">Both</a> of those are large scale food processing plants that do, I believe, use this type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5079.01s">Monogram</a> foods is also in the process, I believe, of undergoing an evaluation to determine whether or not they're going to be subject to our solar ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5087.113s">So</a> I think that these regulatory changes that we're making right now are not at the right time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5094.175s">We</a> need to let our small businesses breathe and we might be making a decision that's going to have a large residual effect on two of our largest employers here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5103.518s">So</a> for those two reasons, I will not be <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5105.488s">voting</a> for this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5106.549s">I</a> also have questions and concerns as to whether why we're focusing ourselves such a narrow scope of just food service establishments, polystyrene juice and a number of other areas as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5116.376s">For</a> example, packing materials, styrofoam coolers, we've all, we all know what a styrofoam cooler is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5122.901s">We've</a> seen them everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5124.382s">So,</a> you know, I think that, well, it's a good, a good how to measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5130.287s">I</a> don't think that it's appropriate for our community at this time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=5989.263s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6143.162s">Madam</a> President, as you're aware, Monday is the marathon, and these individuals that are fortunate enough to have a bib have trained probably for the better part of the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6151.573s">I</a> think Councilor Scarpelli can talk a little bit about that with his wife being an avid marathoner who ran last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6157.428s">But</a> with that being said, I'm every year the council does extend its well wishes to those participants that reside in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6164.611s">Dave</a> McGilvery mentioned resident is the race director for the Boston Marathon a proud graduate of high school, grew up on the Fulton Heights area of the city of Medford and he's done great work with this race. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6176.196s">And</a> it's nice to see that we're back in action after a couple of years off. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6181.38s">So</a> I'd like to wish these runners all the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6183.902s">I</a> have several friends that are running that you mentioned that I will save the risk of embarrassing them by letting people know that they're friends of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6191.908s">But</a> with that being said, Madam President, I do wish them all the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6194.55s">And</a> I ask my council colleagues to join.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6344.203s">Just</a> this past week, a lot was going on in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6348.927s">We</a> had a police officer rescue someone from drowning in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6353.911s">We</a> had a severe shooting down at the courthouse on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6359.236s">And</a> we had a very significant car crash where a motor vehicle actually burst into flames and crashed into a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6365.22s">Last</a> week was also EMS dispatch week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6368.868s">Madam</a> President, I think it's very important that we point out the work of our first responders and the work that they're doing here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6375.052s">Not</a> just our EMS dispatchers, but also those that EMS dispatches out, which would be our ambulance providers, our fire department, our DPW, and our police. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6383.217s">I</a> think they're doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6384.976s">And</a> as we look at the news and we see what's going on around the world as it becomes, as the restrictions are lifted slowly, we're seeing a lot more gun violence in neighboring communities, a lot more knife violence in neighboring communities, a lot more car accidents going on because people for the last couple of years have been spoiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6404.586s">They've</a> not been on the roads driving around. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6407.167s">And</a> then obviously we all know the issues that people have with mental health these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6410.989s">So</a> with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the work <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6413.887s">that</a> our friends down at the police department and the fire department do in dispatching out the necessary EMS providers to be sure that we're all safe in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6422.132s">So</a> with that being said, I'd just like to offer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6424.853s">I'm</a> not on the formal resolution, but just as a thank you in this recognition of dispatch week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8D6g1gdpE1E&t=6615.279s">Madam</a> President, I found the records in order and I move for approval.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_eFJinmL0dp0/2024-11-18_eFJinmL0dp0.html">City Council 04-05-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=53.831s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=54.972s">This</a> was a resolution that had been passed by this previous councils on multiple occasions, this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=59.832s">has</a> been very difficult to get and has not been coming forth with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=62.933s">So</a> I think that at this point in time, it would make sense that we move forward and codify this request so that it would be part of our local law and therefore a requirement that we be provided with this information so that we can properly prepare for the financial responsibilities that we have as council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=81.781s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=126.607s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=127.989s">At</a> the risk of being told I'm not in any position to discuss this matter, I'd like to bring it forward anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=134.775s">It's</a> been brought to my attention that Park Medford has been ticketing the letter carriers in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=142.421s">So</a> the individuals that deliver us medications, bills, mail documents and the like, employees of the United States government, not the state government, not the local government, who are exercising their duties for the post office, not being held harmless in the execution of those duties, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=162.049s">Past</a> practice has always been that our letter carriers would be held harmless when they were using their personal vehicles to conduct post office business. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=168.735s">And</a> this policy has apparently changed with the implementation of the in-house parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=173.817s">So</a> I'd ask that the traffic commission take up the issue and create a letter carriers pass so that our letter carriers that are using their personal vehicles for post office business can park on city streets to deliver the mail and medication and the other materials that they so deliver to the residents of the community free of interference from parking.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=658.617s">Madam</a> President, yes, as the resolution reads, the traffic commission I directed signage to one ramp said to keep this road that has displaced vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=667.185s">These</a> roads, but measure blitz victory park, the backside of victory park, and there's access to walking trails back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=672.97s">But</a> what's happening is the street is very narrow street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=675.992s">It's</a> getting overrun by vehicles, residents in the street can't back out of the driveways, can't find parking in the front rows. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=681.837s">So</a> it's creating a situation where the <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=684.578s">Signage</a> that the traffic commission put up has really displaced a number of vehicles to another neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=691.08s">It's</a> now feeling a negative impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=692.561s">So</a> in the interest of parity, the traffic commission will take simple steps to treat this neighborhood as they treat others and ensure that the signage is erected so that neighbors don't have to go through the weekends of recreational events going on in the community, very similar to what's going on now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=918.79s">If</a> we could just get a copy of the contract between the town of Wilmington and the city of Medford for these services from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=924.936s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2568.561s">I</a> think this is the wrong forum.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2571.402s">So</a> I think, yeah, exactly as the inappropriate for you're in the wrong.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2589.043s">No</a> one can throw you out of that apartment but a judge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2591.225s">It's</a> not like after 60 days, they're gonna lock the doors, take away the key and take all your stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2595.367s">I</a> mean, they can't do that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2596.468s">It</a> has to go through a process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2619.936s">I</a> understand that everybody has a personal circumstance, there's 32 units in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2623.777s">But</a> you know, ultimately, right, it's, you have to vacate, or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2626.879s">Well,</a> we're gonna take you to court, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2633.161s">But</a> it's a no fault eviction because it's not for non-payment of rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2636.203s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2636.463s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2637.083s">So</a> it's not for non-payment of rent, it's not for, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2639.985s">selling</a> drugs out of the apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2641.106s">No,</a> no, no cause right it's it's a contract issue right it's a contract issue between the property owner and the tenants that are in the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2648.531s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2648.891s">So,</a> ultimately, the forum where it's going to be resolved would be in some type of mediation, whether in the court system, you know what I mean as this goes through the process but the notice to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2660.027s">It's</a> just like, listen, in 30 days, we're filing an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2664.049s">That's</a> really what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2665.15s">So</a> it's, they're giving you a 30 days notice to say they're going to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2668.131s">Right</a> now, through the discussions that have happened here at this body and through the administration, they've said, look, it's not going to be 30 days now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2675.094s">It's</a> going to be 60 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2676.795s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2677.115s">And</a> if anybody is a tenant at Willow's leases up, we're not going to move on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2681.398s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2681.738s">We're</a> going to wait 60 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2683.919s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2684.319s">So</a> that's going to initiate the process, but think, <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2689.122s">Between</a> the, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2690.724s">18</a> units that have leases and 14 that don't?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2694.287s">Or</a> vice versa.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2702.335s">18</a> with leases, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2703.076s">All</a> probably expiring at different times. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2705.298s">All</a> the 60 day notice to stick with. <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2706.839s">By</a> the time this building gets empty, how long, how much time is this going to pass?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eFJinmL0dp0&t=2755.297s">I</a> mean, yeah, you're talking about public service.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_zdYmEW8K0F8/2024-11-18_zdYmEW8K0F8.html">City Council 03-29-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=423.867s">One</a> of the first papers that was heard in the first meeting last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=429.03s">And</a> we requested that the city solicitor's office draft us a draft ordinance to establish a beautification committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=436.735s">And</a> after 30 months, we've gotten this great document here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=439.496s">It's</a> like the Magna Carta. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=440.677s">It's</a> a page and a half long. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=443.459s">And</a> on it, it establishes the criteria for us to establish a beautification committee here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=451.014s">And</a> the purpose is to act as an advisory committee to the city and city departments to address issues that the regular citizen cares about, that regular people are concerned about, the lack of delivery of quality city services here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=463.444s">The</a> curb appeal in this community now is worse than it's ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=466.906s">I've</a> lived in this community my whole life, and I've never, ever, ever seen it look worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=471.15s">I've</a> never seen it look worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=472.651s">Our</a> roads are in tough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=473.872s">Our</a> sidewalks are in tough shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=475.133s">There's</a> stumps everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=477.274s">State-owned</a> properties are in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=479.296s">State-owned</a> properties are sloppy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=480.924s">I</a> think a beautification committee can help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=483.246s">I</a> think a beautification committee can help us direct where we want to see our efforts go. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=487.45s">I</a> think a beautification committee can help us raise awareness on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=491.814s">So</a> the mayor's office and the mayor's lawyer has provided us with a draft of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=496.138s">I</a> think it needs a little bit of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=497.94s">I'd</a> obviously be happy to refer it to the rules and ordinance subcommittee for us to properly vet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=503.325s">I'm</a> looking at this document here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=506.023s">It</a> went from an advisory beautification committee established by the city council to the mayor's beautification committee that she's going to be able to appoint and remove members that are free. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=514.228s">Well,</a> it's not necessarily what I was looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=518.571s">But</a> I think with the leadership of Chairman bears and that subcommittee will be able to come up with a document that everybody would be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=524.335s">So</a> with that being said, I'd make the motion to refer the paper to the subcommittee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1064.583s">Madam</a> President, as we all know, elections have changed a lot over recent years with early voting, with the adoption of technology, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1072.289s">So</a> I think this is a good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1073.63s">It's</a> a way that we can move into the 21st century. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1075.671s">I</a> support the council's initiative, and I think that it's something that will help us all in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=1080.115s">So</a> it's something that I support a lot of, and I'll be happy to vote for it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2424.382s">And</a> by way of history, how are you, by the way, good to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2427.705s">It's</a> good to see you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2429.887s">Don't</a> take it personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2431.868s">I</a> never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2432.829s">In</a> June of 21, we passed the budget, and that budget was $250,000 to hire a director and three control specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2447.871s">June</a> of 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2449.272s">In</a> December of 21, the mayor came before us with a paper, 21631, which was a request to enter into a contract to lease vehicles for a period that exceeds the three year maximum duration as outlined in the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2465.782s">And</a> also for us to create some employee classifications in our compensation adjustment factor ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2474.587s">And</a> during that presentation, it was discussed that <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2478.918s">the</a> department was going to be moving in a direction where they wouldn't be working with one director in three offices anymore, that they wanted to create several positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2489.964s">One</a> would be a specialist that would run in the $47,000 to $53,000 range. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2493.085s">One</a> would be a full person that would run in the $49,000 to $55,000 range. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2495.847s">One</a> would be a repair person in that same range and a lead repair person at $53,000 to $67,000 per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2508.67s">And</a> at that time that would have brought the whole department up to I believe nine with the director's position correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2574.931s">Now,</a> on February 8th, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2579.617s">This</a> council took up paper 21631 that was introduced by the mayor in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2587.384s">We</a> introduced week one of this term and the administration tabled that paper based upon a question for a sufficiency of the vote as to whether or not we wanted to create these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2603.86s">My</a> concern wasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2605.78s">So</a> much about whether or not we want to create the positions, but it's whether or not we're creating these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2611.402s">That</a> fashions compliance that's in compliance with the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2615.443s">So</a> on February 15th, this council took a vote on paper, two, two zero seven four. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2623.842s">asking</a> the city solicitor to give us an opinion as to whether or not the city of Medford is in compliance with general laws chapter 44 section 33a when it came to the creation of these positions and the funding thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2636.988s">That</a> was February 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2638.988s">March</a> 15th just passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2641.309s">We're</a> now coming up into April. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2642.67s">We</a> still haven't gotten an opinion from the solicitor's office as to whether or not these positions are created appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2648.869s">We've</a> already made an appropriation initially of $250,000 to fund this department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2654.812s">And</a> we've already allowed the administration to enter into a long-term lease that exceeds the statutory requirements outlined by general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2663.696s">I</a> think we've been very fair with the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2667.538s">But</a> the question still comes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2670.459s">When</a> we have a legal question, we're asking the mayor to give us an answer, the city solicitor to give us an answer so that we can have the guidance that we need <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2679.031s">so</a> that we can live up to the oath that we all took to abide by the rules of the city council, the ordinances of this community, and the statutes established through the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2690.913s">And</a> that information still isn't forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2692.853s">I</a> find it very difficult for me to take a money vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2697.194s">It</a> has nothing to do with the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2698.794s">It</a> has nothing to do with what you're trying to accomplish or what direction we're trying to go in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2705.956s">It</a> has more to do with me being concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2708.772s">that</a> we're not spending appropriately, and that we're not complying with time-tested standards that past administrations have always complied with. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2718.617s">And</a> that's where I stand on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2722.399s">I</a> can see this transfer coming to us again at the end of the year as an end-of-the-year transfer, and it's something that most likely I'll have no problem supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2730.243s">But</a> at this point in time this evening, based upon the history of these classifications, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2735.877s">the</a> lack of respect, the lack of response that the administration has given this council when it comes to seeking legal guidance, leaving us in a position to look like Mickey the Dutz. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2748.339s">We</a> couldn't do our jobs if we wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2749.96s">Well,</a> because we don't have the tools to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2755.541s">We</a> don't have the tools to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2757.381s">And</a> it seems to me the only way that the city administration seems to listen sometimes is when we talk about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2765.259s">We</a> talk about money, that's when they start to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2771.021s">Now,</a> I'm supportive of a parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2774.063s">I</a> think that we need to sit down and take a look at this because we can't be doing it drip by drip. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2780.345s">250,000</a> here, 45,000 here, a long-term lease here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2786.208s">I</a> don't think that that's the way we should be doing it because we don't have any idea what our spending plan's really gonna look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2793.637s">This</a> council has voted in the past to have quarterly presentations by our CFO to tell us where we are in terms of revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2803.819s">We've</a> asked for copies of the Warren articles on a monthly basis so that we can see where our money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2809.161s">We</a> have to beg for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2810.741s">We</a> do not get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2811.801s">We</a> have to beg for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2813.842s">Beg</a> for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2814.562s">I</a> want to know where the money is being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2816.183s">When</a> I say, yeah, I vote for this appropriation, I want to see that Warren article that shows that money going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2823.66s">And</a> we can't, we don't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2824.98s">We</a> don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2826.241s">We</a> do not get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2829.421s">So</a> that reason, and that reason alone, I'm not going to be supporting this paper tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=2832.442s">I</a> can't confidently take this vote because I still haven't gotten a response from the city solicitor as to whether or not these positions are being created appropriately and whether or not we're in compliance with what we're supposed to be doing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3401.536s">I</a> pay for my child care at the public schools for credit card. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3404.697s">I</a> pay for all the recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3405.957s">Yeah,</a> no, that's online.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3811.976s">Mine</a> is on the same point. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=3813.076s">Are</a> we going to be expecting to get a formal response to the council resolution that was sent to the mayor's office?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4464.625s">Just</a> one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4466.125s">Um,</a> based on the staffing levels, what would the annual personnel cost be for the department?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4479.305s">And</a> at this staffing level, about how long do you think it would take before the department is self sufficient or self funding.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4503.789s">Okay,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4795.983s">I</a> understand Councilor fabulous frustration with the circumstances in the situation, however I don't feel as though further. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4804.845s">encouraging</a> the Historical Commission to use their power to weaponize themselves against developers and our community is a good public.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4957.587s">Would</a> it be possible for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4958.948s">Hunt's</a> office to mail out these resources to the individuals that reside in that residence so that they, even in the mail, they've received notice to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4966.934s">We</a> know that the whole entire unit, according to Councilor Caraviello, has received a notice to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4971.278s">Why</a> can't our office just mail them all this information that we're talking about right now so that they'll get a copy of the pamphlet in the mail, they'll get a copy of housing families' contact information and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4980.025s">Ultimately,</a> what are the odds of in a city of 60,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4984.47s">The</a> residents that 26 to 22, 22 to 26 Bradley wrote us in here right now, watching the council meeting, right down in the chat, what they're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4992.475s">Probably</a> very slim to none, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=4993.796s">If</a> we really want to help them, why don't we reach out to them directly?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5733.292s">Hunt,</a> do you think you'll have to wait as long as we do for a legal response?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5747.188s">This</a> was the paper we took up tonight, but thank you, I appreciate your work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5916.808s">I</a> doubt if any of them are reading that on them, Mr. Rick, I mean, ultimately she said that legal counsel said not to do that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5935.899s">So</a> if we have a housing partner, <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5937.874s">that</a> we're working with like ABCD or housing, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5941.595s">Maybe</a> we let housing families, we let them do it and then we'll fund the mailing, something like that, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5946.677s">But</a> it's a slippery slope, we got the middle of something like this, you know what I mean, from this level. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5952.979s">So,</a> you know, I think we should send them something, but if legal counsel's telling us not to, or they're not getting the opinion, let's have a report back to us with the next step side with the action plan that's from our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5964.59s">Why</a> are we dictating? <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5965.77s">You</a> know, they're getting the legal advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5967.431s">They're</a> the ones that have the experts, the housing planner and the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5969.612s">Why</a> don't we have them report back to us in a 14 day period is what the next steps are.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=5975.413s">It's</a> not my ponder that I'm just interrupting my good friend over here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6607.521s">I</a> think Madam President, if I may, it's important to point out that consistently, the city administration's only <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6615.912s">committed</a> the chapter 90 funds that are given to us from the state to be used for resurfacing projects, which are about about what $900,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6623.778s">And</a> if we look at when the last full road in this community was resurfaced, I think it's safe to say that it hasn't happened in more than 16 months, we had a full carpet car resurfacing of the roadway in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6636.598s">So</a> the commitment's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6637.759s">The</a> commitment has to be there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6639.479s">When</a> this council said we need to have a long-term plan, we have a capital plan, and then we did a pavement assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6645.341s">Well,</a> that just threw the capital plan right out the window because the pavement assessment comes with a bill of $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6649.702s">Then</a> we have a needs assessment at the high school that's going to the school building assistance program up in the state that's saying that we need another significant investment in another facility as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6661.971s">It's</a> all about prioritization of the funds and I've always been a strong advocate in holding our <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6667.08s">public</a> utilities accountable, getting community benefits from them when we offer them the opportunity to stage their equipment on our roadways, mitigation and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6676.205s">So</a> I think it's going to take some out of the box thinking as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6678.827s">It's</a> a creative thinking in order for us to address some of these issues because they're longstanding and they're not going anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6683.99s">They're</a> only getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6685.251s">That's</a> why I brought forward that issue that you referred to earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zdYmEW8K0F8&t=6688.953s">So</a> I thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU/2024-11-18_PQNVkYiOrIU.html">City Council 03-22-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=420.506s">I'm</a> very grateful that we finally got to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=426.167s">This</a> is something that I recall taking up, I believe, in my second term as a member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=432.474s">This</a> evening, there's someone that's not a member of this body anymore who deserves credit for getting us this far, and that's John Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=442.476s">Madam</a> President, John really made joining a priority during his time as the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=447.778s">John</a> worked very hard in bringing us to where we are to help us secure Mr. Bobrowski and his leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=454.637s">to</a> get us to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=456.138s">We've</a> met probably for close to 60 hours as a body on this topic over the course of 24 months to get us to where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=466.086s">It's</a> been a very open and deliberate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=467.868s">It's</a> been very transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=469.329s">There</a> have been, I believe, nine draft documents that have circulated among the council that have all been vetted through public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=477.476s">We've</a> had the <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=480.482s">duly</a> required public hearing with Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=484.084s">Notices</a> have been posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=485.185s">The</a> Community Development Board had an opportunity to vet this motion as well, and they came back with a series of over 70 recommendations that the council took up in a meeting, went through each and every one of them, addressed each and every one of them, and we finally came up with this document right here, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=497.832s">This</a> is a document I'm very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=500.174s">I</a> think that this body should be very proud of this document, and in this young stage in our term, this work product that we're putting out so far is something that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=508.088s">And</a> I support this measure that's before us wholeheartedly, and I vote for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1510.134s">I'm</a> convinced that the best path to ensure comprehensive and informed review of our city's charter is to follow the time-tested path of gathering signatures and complying with the various provisions of the general laws that surround that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1522.697s">There</a> are some that would disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1526.418s">And</a> to them, I say that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1529.624s">Charter</a> is our local constitution, and in effect is a document that's far too important to allow an abbreviated review and to take shortcuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1538.188s">The</a> process established in the general law specifically establishing charter review is more than just a procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1543.751s">It's</a> the right of local self-government, and the politicians shouldn't be deciding this for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1549.733s">This</a> alone should give every resident the reason to pause and say, let's let this process unfold in its time-tested wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1558.562s">the</a> initiative petition process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1560.863s">Proper</a> discernment is never rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1563.385s">A</a> perfect example of this proper discernment was in November, 2015, when the people of Medford spoke at the ballot box and overwhelmingly adopted the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1573.53s">The</a> success of this program can be attributed to the Preserve Medford campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1578.653s">Now</a> this group could have came to the council and pleaded with us to take shortcuts and to put this matter on the council agenda and to put it on the ballot, to do a homeown petition and to send it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1587.175s">But</a> instead, there was a grassroots campaign with efforts devoted to speaking to residents door to door, in the community, in the streets, at the parks, addressing concerns and issues, and raising awareness and educating the electorate about the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1601.159s">And</a> as a result, because people got a chance to talk, information was shared, concerns were raised, and it was time to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1606.28s">The</a> voters were informed, aware, and knowledgeable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1609.041s">It</a> was democracy at its best. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1611.642s">Coming</a> off a three-year pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1613.905s">We</a> have not had the ability to attend our children's games or school events. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1617.328s">Graduations</a> and proms have been canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1619.43s">There's</a> absolutely zero sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1623.473s">We</a> don't have the strong relationships with the neighbors in our community that we've had prior to the pandemic, and we need to build those back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1630.78s">In</a> a time when we have no sense of normalcy or stability, I don't think our child should be treated with any less care than the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1637.53s">The</a> residents of our city deserve every opportunity to absorb the information before they're asked to decide on whether to do anything to our child. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1643.653s">And</a> the initiative petition process meets this mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1646.855s">I</a> hope my position's not misunderstood, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1650.417s">It's</a> an important issue, and my disagreement is not over the method, is over the method, and not over the motivation, and over the process, and not over the principle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1658.841s">But</a> ultimately, this should be a grassroots effort that comes from the ground up, not the top down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1662.703s">The</a> people shouldn't be making the decisions for the politicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1665.144s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1764.526s">I</a> do believe that this was raised Madam President some 2436 months ago with the question was asked to the city solicitors to whether or not the city's in compliance with the Municipal Monetization Act and these provisions that you speak of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1775.23s">To</a> date, we have not received response from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1778.252s">I</a> just like to highlight the fact that our ability to conduct business is hampered when we are not provided with the tools and toolbox necessary to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1785.192s">And</a> here we are some period of time later, now addressing an issue that we could have put to bed a very long time ago had we been provided with the support necessary for us to conduct our business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1794.18s">As</a> we look at the work that we've done this evening, when we have someone in our corner that's willing to provide us with the legal advice that we need, we are able to put out a very good work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1803.888s">When</a> we don't have that, here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1806.641s">Before</a> May 2nd, we have to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1808.182s">We've</a> been waiting since the Municipal Modernization Act passed for an answer as to whether or not we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1812.705s">So</a> I'd just like to point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1813.826s">And</a> once again, reiterate my priority for the budget for this year to have an assistant city solicitor dedicated to the Medford City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1874.92s">Is</a> Mr. Mulkey on the call as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=1877.921s">With</a> the zoning issue?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2005.241s">So</a> multifamily, do we just do we know how much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2009.195s">with</a> the dollar figure, the grant eligibility would be on the table that we lose access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2014.496s">So</a> is it $100 million worth of grant money, or is it $65,000 a grant?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2053.618s">We've</a> been receiving them in the past.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2427.891s">Question?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2431.334s">Are</a> they saying we have to change our zoning? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2433.875s">Or</a> are they saying if we don't change our zoning, you don't have access to these grant funds?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2442.322s">In</a> essence, we don't have to do anything.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2455.186s">I</a> mean, that's what I'm what's the trade off how much money we get from these grants if we're not getting any money from the grants is it really worth creating 6500 units.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2654.963s">Does</a> it have to be within a half a mile from a train station located in your community or just the train station?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2678.043s">And</a> that's more than half a mile of a station, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2680.785s">The</a> only circles that we have, but we have Winchester station, you have Oak Grove station, you have ball square station. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2686.79s">You</a> might be able to take those 6,500 units instead of slapping them right in Wellington circle, which is probably where they're going to end up going. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2693.396s">Um,</a> be able to spread them around.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2713.762s">I</a> mean, I think the idea is that most of these stations like the Greenland, for example, isn't, it's not Medford train, it's a regional, it's for the region, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2722.206s">So</a> why should Medford bear the brunt of all the housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2725.527s">Why</a> shouldn't the region? <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=2726.648s">If</a> the train station is there for transportation needs for the region, and we're trying to meet housing needs for the region, then why shouldn't our regional partners that utilize this service that we have also feel some of the impact?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3354.622s">I</a> don't think Tufts University's property would be taken into consideration, right, at all for the density calculation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3631.507s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3632.788s">Yes,</a> I just last Tuesday, there was a chemical spill, I believe, or an evacuation of the chemical laboratory at 62 Talbot Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3639.911s">That's</a> about all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3641.328s">I've</a> been able to find out about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3643.31s">I'm</a> sure that it was an event that was handled appropriately by our first responders and by our friends at Tufts University, but it's nice for us to know exactly what happened, what went on, to be sure that we can provide a sense of relief to those that live in the neighborhood who are asking questions and have concerns about what they live next to and what risks they may pose to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=3662.785s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask the administration to respond to this, and Tufts University to respond to this request in a timely manner, and ask my council colleagues to support the measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4147.509s">It's</a> people like you that make the city go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4149.37s">Thank</a> you very much for putting your life on the line for the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4153.253s">I</a> certainly as one member of this council don't have much of an opinion one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4158.097s">Relative</a> to Mr. Delano's appointment to this position I think that, you know, basis, he is a resume that would enable him to meet the basic criteria of the job and I think that he'd be able to do a good job at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4168.744s">He</a> has shown us through his <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4172.465s">History</a> is a firefighter that he knows how to serve the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4176.187s">My</a> issue isn't necessarily with disappointment at all, Madam President, my issue is the fact that right now we're in the middle of state election cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4185.133s">And</a> we have candidates that are in the process of trying to get their nomination papers certified, but we do not have a board of registrars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4194.001s">in</a> our elections office to certify these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4196.663s">So</a> while I understand the importance of a liquor commissioner in this community, I don't think that that carries the same weight as a registrar of voters here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4205.769s">And</a> I think that the mayor needs to act on these appointments that are necessary for us to comply with state law so that we can conduct our state elections that are coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4213.554s">And</a> so the candidates that are participating in these state elections can have the opportunity to get their paperwork certified. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4220.917s">Now,</a> all three of our registrars have stepped down in the past 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4225.941s">We</a> have no registrars of voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4229.004s">Now</a> we have a look at commissions retiring as well as an appointment that's backfilling that and I'm going to support Mr. Dolfano when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4235.929s">I</a> certainly have no problem with his application before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4239.773s">However,</a> I do have a problem filling appointments <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4243.475s">when</a> we have a big void down in our elections office and we have a major state election coming up right now and we need a board of registrars down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4255.784s">We</a> have legislation pending <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4258.146s">in</a> the city solicitor's office that we've been waiting on from the administration now, and I'm sure Councilor Bears can talk a little bit more to that than I. We've met on it, we've had Committee of the Whole on it, something that we all support in establishing an Elections Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4271.037s">So</a> those are a couple items that I think are very important that should be taken precedent over some of these appointments that have come before us, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4277.923s">Mr.</a> Belafonte, like I said, this has nothing to do about your appointment or your ability to do this job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4281.986s">It</a> really has to do with the administration and the approach that they're taking in addressing some of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4286.811s">Um,</a> you know, we're looking at a board of registrars that's been vacant now for how long, Mr. Clark, can you tell me how long, Mr. Lasky and Miss Murray.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4331.985s">Okay,</a> when was this appointment made temporarily?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4339.01s">Is</a> this temporary appointment allow us to comply with the Secretary of State's guidelines and standards?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4358.464s">And</a> Mr. Crowley still serves as a temporary appointee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4360.825s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4361.925s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4366.547s">Only</a> one person on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4368.947s">I'm</a> still sitting ex-officio.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4654.083s">On</a> that, Madam President, I do believe, looking at the general laws, that I think these appointments to the Board of Registrars are supposed to come through the City Council as well and be appointed by the City Council for confirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4664.25s">So,</a> I'm not sure that the Mayor has the right to appoint Mark Corrales to the Board of Registrars without confirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4672.576s">Temporary</a> or not.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4677.591s">I</a> have I talked about the need for this Council to have a lawyer by any chance this have I have I spoke about that at all ever because I mean the left hand doesn't know what the rights doing and no one can scratch the head across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4689.704s">All</a> right, I don't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4691.326s">But</a> I mean, ultimately, I'm looking at the general law right here and in the first section says the position shall be filled nearly as reasonably as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4698.193s">and</a> it should be confirmed by the council, unless that charter says something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4702.495s">I'm</a> just, I'm at a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4704.176s">I'm</a> at a loss to the inaction on easy items that keep us in compliance with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4709.619s">Easy</a> items that keep us in compliance with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4711.94s">Now,</a> Bob, I'm gonna vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4714.281s">I'm</a> gonna vote for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4714.962s">I</a> support your resume. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4715.802s">I</a> support your appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4718.584s">You</a> know, however, I don't support the antics and the human resource nightmare that we have going on across the hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4729.909s">Council</a> night to clarify a little bit on what you can ask the court with all due respect I don't think it's your job to clarify the actions the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4736.933s">I</a> appreciate what you're trying to do I really do my frustration level on this is like going through the roof because, you know, we all take an oath to comply with the law to withhold the laws of the Commonwealth of Constitution the ordinances of the city, and I feel like it only, it only applies when someone's looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4752.496s">Sometimes,</a> it only applies when someone's looking at if no one points out it's just going to continue it's just going to continue just going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4758.423s">It's</a> very frustrating, but but please continue I do apologize for interrupt.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4819.062s">It's</a> curious also that it just so happened to be like right before an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4821.963s">And,</a> you know, we still, we're just finding out now, right, the chief of staff just finding out now about a resignation of a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4827.866s">Now,</a> now, but it was in November, right before the election, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4831.588s">And</a> it was an appointment that was made temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4834.87s">And</a> that person still never before the council made permanent and it's been well over 90 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4978.218s">I,</a> for one, as one member, I wouldn't require Mr. Delfano to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4981.321s">I</a> don't think this is an issue about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4982.563s">I</a> think it's more an issue about what's going on across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4985.186s">That's</a> why I voted not to table, because I don't feel as though he should be held victim for his boss's mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=4991.653s">But</a> with that being said, I'm satisfied for him to not have to return.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5173.443s">If</a> I may, to the Carroll family, my deepest condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5176.766s">I</a> know Maura, I know Tommy, and Leslie and Jill, and, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5181.839s">One</a> thing you can always say is that Mrs. Carol and the Carroll family have always been involved in the community they've always been people that have been giving to the city of Medford, and she's in a better place now I wish her family all the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5192.889s">She</a> rest in peace.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5467.653s">Yes,</a> Councilor Caraviello, thanks for putting this measure on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5470.294s">Linda</a> and Jim, both great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5472.594s">You</a> know, growing up, having a lot of friends that lived down near Tufts Park and Tufts Square Tobacco, that was always a place where kids could go to find work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5481.107s">And</a> I have a number of friends of mine that going through elementary school, junior high school, and high school would be over there doing side jobs at Tough Square Tobacco for Jim and Linda. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5489.41s">Two</a> of my close friends actually ended up becoming employees there through high school, working at the East Boston store, selling cigars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5495.532s">They</a> became cigar aficionados, working with Jim Schena. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5500.653s">They're</a> great people and they're real neighborhood people that took care of the kid next door that would be sitting on the front porch and watching the kids play in the street, making sure that nobody was causing any damage to the neighborhood, no one bothering the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5513.256s">Real</a> neighborhood people, real good folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5515.417s">And</a> he's gonna be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5516.657s">His</a> presence in the neighborhood's gonna be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5518.377s">Post</a> Street won't be the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5599.917s">Just</a> if I may add my condolences to the Casey family. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5603.239s">Joe's</a> become a friend over the years, and I only didn't know Mr. Casey personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5607.122s">His</a> reputation preceded him. <a href="https://youtu.be/PQNVkYiOrIU&t=5609.043s">He</a> was a man that was well respected in the community, and if his children are any indication of what type of a person he was, then he was a great gentleman as well.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_uoSJeAqES98/2024-11-19_uoSJeAqES98.html">City Council 03-15-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=44.707s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=46.408s">Jerry</a> DeCristofaro, who passed away February 26th, he was a lifelong resident, lived in Summit Road, the father of Barbara DeCristofaro from Metro Police Department and Dr. DeCristofaro Registrar. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=59.215s">Jerry</a> spent 45 years in public service for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=63.038s">He</a> served as Chief Investigator for the Licensing Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=67.7s">He</a> was responsible for establishing the rules and regulations there and enforcing standards for our licensees in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=74.324s">known</a> for his classic resemblance to Luciano Pavarotti. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=79.747s">Mr.</a> De Cristofaro was someone that was loved by many. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=82.669s">He</a> had failing health in his later years, but I remember him fondly growing up in metropolitics as someone who's always been there to lend an ear and lend wisdom and lend advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=91.674s">He's</a> certainly someone that did a great deal for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=94.356s">He</a> raised two wonderful children who <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=96.53s">believe</a> in service, as evidenced by their work, and he will be sadly missed Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uoSJeAqES98&t=101.912s">So,</a> Jerry to Christopher our dear friend who served this community in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the better part of 50 years, I'd ask that this council joins me in extending condolences to his family on their recent loss.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=127.177s">This</a> is a measure that we vetted properly, we've gone through a number of meetings on and it's something that I support a lot of leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=133.038s">What</a> this does is it allows senior citizens the options to defer their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=136.319s">If</a> in fact they find themselves in a financial situation and they make the income hardship guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=141.0s">I</a> think this is a policy that would make sense for those in our community especially based upon the housing shortages that we're seeing the economic circumstances that we're seeing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=149.769s">That</a> in fact that we have a large population of senior citizens living in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=152.911s">I</a> think this only makes sense to provide them with this type of relief and I support it will hardly move approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=211.483s">Councilor</a> Knight, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=213.504s">This</a> was on the agenda last week and I requested to be tabled for the opportunities of my council colleagues to also speak on it because they know James and Maureen very well, as do I, and if anybody played Medford pop Warner in the late 80s and early 1990s, they'd know Jimmy Heath as the man with the best mullet in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=231.417s">He</a> and Maureen have been married now for 30 years and Maureen's been a active participant at the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=235.94s">Francis</a> Mothers Club for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=238.382s">They've</a> raised four beautiful children here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=240.873s">and</a> they recently celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=243.775s">Many</a> of us may know Jimmy from his time down at Pocanti Skating Rink, driving the Zamboni, or up at the Field of Dreams, working there as a ticket taker and a security guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=252.441s">And</a> many of us know Maureen from all her involvement through youth sports, Metro Pop Warner in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=257.004s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in congratulating two individuals that displayed the type of community that we here in Metro believe in, James and Maureen Heath, and the momentous occasion of their 30th anniversary.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=362.959s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=364.36s">Many</a> of us know Kevin and Kathleen from Medford youth softball and Medford youth lacrosse Kevin was one of the inaugural coaches in the Medford youth lacrosse program back in the late 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=373.442s">Um,</a> he rose up the ranks to become a past president actually, uh, just giving up the title just a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=378.685s">And,</a> um, when you're looking for Kevin or Kathleen, you'll probably be able to find them at one of our fields, uh, at one of these practices, softball, lacrosse, uh, sometimes the hockey rink, even I imagine that, um, but they just celebrated the 20th anniversary of the two great people that have dedicated a lot of their time, energy, commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=394.274s">Um,</a> especially in the realm of, uh, youth sports and, and bringing our programs together as volunteers and boards of directors and coaches and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=401.612s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I'd like to first recognize Kevin Finnegan, who was a senior when I was a freshman in high school, who was very good to me growing up, someone who I've been able to develop a friendship with over the years, and someone I've been able to work with on a number of these initiatives, especially the Medford Lacrosse Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=416.175s">He's</a> someone that's really put his money where his mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=418.476s">He's</a> someone that's always been there to show that his actions speak louder than his words. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=423.217s">A</a> man of not much to say, but a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=427.038s">And</a> he's someone that I admire, and he's a friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=429.195s">And</a> I certainly wish him and his wife a great anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=431.638s">20</a> years is a great, great, great achievement that I congratulate them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=435.582s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting them this evening in their celebration and also recognizing the work that they do in this community to make sure that Medford is a place where we can all thrive.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=680.727s">Thank</a> you very much, Larry, congratulations and thank you for all you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=684.249s">When</a> you sit down and you think about 20 years of service, and then you look behind this rail and you look at this body combined we have 31 years behind this real combined 31 years of service Larry has 28 by himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=696.637s">The</a> institutional knowledge that this man possesses is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=699.119s">He's</a> seen it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=700.219s">He's</a> been at every single city council meeting for 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=705.03s">I</a> would have found you not guilty, Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=706.592s">I</a> would have gave you parole a long time ago, literally. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=711.56s">But</a> the institutional knowledge that you possess and the friendship that you've shown me over the years has been something that's tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=719.151s">Larry's</a> a man of few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=720.873s">But</a> if you ask him a question, he'll certainly give you an answer and he's been here and seen it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=724.476s">He's</a> a great resource to all of us and he's something that we need, especially when you see the transition through City Hall and the department heads and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=730.88s">You</a> know, we need someone that has an institutional knowledge that can guide us in the right direction, point us in the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=735.223s">And</a> Larry's that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=736.464s">You</a> know, the City Messenger's job is to deliver the papers and to make sure that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=742.009s">informed</a> with the provided with the materials that are necessary for us to prepare for the meeting but Larry does much more than that, and his title messenger does not necessarily reflect all that he does for this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=753.322s">So</a> Larry thank you very much I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=755.565s">We've</a> been a great friend for a long time and I wouldn't want anybody else sitting in that chair for you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1685.027s">have</a> been paying attention to the recent ongoings and current events here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1689.172s">Just</a> recently, one of our state troopers from the Wellington Barracks was critically injured in a motor vehicle accident on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1697.945s">Her</a> services are actually being held this evening up at, I believe, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1701.668s">Anthony's</a> Church in Urbana. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1703.549s">But</a> Trupa Bucci was a 34-year-old state trooper who was relatively new on the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1709.613s">She</a> had a career prior life working over at Encore Casino as a security specialist over there with a number of Metro residents that I know very well, including Arthur Simmons and Jason Wong, for example, who called me to express their concern over the circumstances surrounding this terrible accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1725.963s">My</a> life was taken well too short due to a preventable motor vehicle accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1730.867s">I</a> think it's all too common that we see the way that people drive on the roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1735.43s">The</a> condition of our roads, the circumstances that led to this event show that a lot of it has to do less with driver training and less with driver responsibility than it does with actual design. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1746.859s">And</a> we sat here last week, we talked about Vision Zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1750.107s">We</a> talked about using design to make our roads safer because sometimes there's just nothing we can do to prevent an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1756.534s">And</a> when you hear about the circumstances surrounding this incident, I think it's safe to say that the truck driver was not necessarily at fault, and this was an accident that just occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1765.163s">It</a> was really something that was almost preventable, unpreventable. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1769.247s">But</a> to lose a trooper at age 34 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1772.61s">with</a> so much potential and so much life ahead of her. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1776.333s">It's</a> something that's very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1777.714s">She</a> suited up every day to make sure that this community was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1780.196s">She</a> was stationed right here in our city, and she responded to the calls that we all make. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1784.379s">And</a> I think it's very important for us to recognize the sacrifices that she's made sacrifices that her family made through her service. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1791.824s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues for this resolution, and I'm sending <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1796.87s">family</a> of tomorrow G, not only her personal family but also extended family at the Masters of State barrack state his back to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1871.37s">Now</a> Madam President, thank you very much and I do believe the councilor Scarpelli is a co sponsor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1877.211s">Just</a> recently, Mr. Boyd passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1880.372s">someone</a> who lived in the city of Medford for, geez, got to be 70 years, was a military veteran and just an all-around good person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1887.875s">His</a> son, Buzzer, and I are very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1889.916s">His</a> son, Billy, was just elected not too long ago to the New Hampshire State Legislature, and the city council had honored him on this achievement as a high school graduate, getting elected to the New Hampshire State Legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1901.981s">So</a> as you can tell, he's a proud father who raised a good family of public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1906.765s">He</a> was, as I said, was a veteran, as was his son, Bowser, after him. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1910.766s">And</a> recently he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1912.526s">He</a> will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1913.727s">Mr.</a> Boyd was quite a character. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1916.568s">I</a> fondly remember a conversation that I had with him when the tree in front of his house was removed and he called and wanted the tree replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1923.789s">So</a> I reached out to forestry department and I asked that they replace a tree in front of the Boyd's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1930.671s">And</a> they went down and they replaced the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1933.232s">And</a> Mr. Boyd called me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1934.945s">And</a> he said, what the hell is this? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1936.486s">And</a> if you saw what this was, it was Charlie Brown's Christmas tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1940.548s">It</a> was the funniest looking little tree I'd ever see. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1942.589s">It</a> was maybe eight inches tall and didn't have a leave on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1946.431s">And</a> me and Mr. Boyd just laughed and laughed and laughed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1948.852s">It</a> was one of the funniest things that this happened to me in government service. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1953.094s">You</a> know, when you call and you ask them to plant a tree and the gentleman says, the trees come in and we're all excited about the tree coming and then <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1958.537s">There</a> it is, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1959.558s">It's</a> a little twig sticking out of the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1962.099s">He</a> didn't know whether it was supposed to water it or pull it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1964.701s">It</a> was just, it was a really funny circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1967.443s">And</a> he and I laughed about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1968.604s">And</a> his son and I laughed about it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1970.665s">But</a> just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1971.686s">I</a> take it from us, well, far too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1974.107s">Many</a> of us that live in the Salem Street area would see him driving around in his beautiful Corvette. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1978.868s">And</a> that's when we know that Mr. Boyd was out and about. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1982.009s">But</a> with that being said, I'd just like to ask my council colleagues to extend a note of condolence to the family for a United States military veteran who's served our country and served this community so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1992.434s">He's</a> raised two civic-minded children in Buzzard Valley. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=1996.256s">One's</a> a state rep, the other one's a veterans advocate up at Post 45, and they've both done great things for this community as well as their father. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=2003.519s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4463.996s">Madam</a> President, I do believe that these were all discussed in the Committee of the Whole and they were all voted out, recommended favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4470.842s">We</a> have a CPC that does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4473.424s">We</a> have a group of people that properly vet these applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4477.347s">They</a> go through a very open and deliberate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4479.829s">They</a> keep us informed every step of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4482.051s">These</a> are projects that we've talked about in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4483.652s">These</a> are projects that we've all openly supported in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4486.775s">I</a> personally think that I have no problem this evening moving for approval on all items before us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4673.943s">found</a> them in disarray. <a href="https://youtu.be/q9HX92LVUcg&t=4675.204s">This</a> week, I find them in array.<h2><a href="../2024-11-18_F9BRnpGt19U/2024-11-18_F9BRnpGt19U.html">City Council 02-22-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=244.75s">I</a> do have a couple of concerns relative to a business being open until 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=248.353s">seven</a> days a week in a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=251.716s">We</a> know this location, we know where it's located, Lambert streets and right there on the corner, but it's a number of homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=259.902s">What</a> type of business do you get? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=262.565s">Is</a> mostly a volume foot traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=264.246s">Can</a> the applicant give us a little bit more insight into what's going on at the place? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=268.169s">Is</a> it mostly foot traffic, mostly delivery type of stuff? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=271.117s">I</a> mean, I'm very reluctant to say yes, they open till two o'clock in the morning on Sunday, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=276.02s">With</a> foot traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=277.221s">I</a> don't want this to be the place where people are leaving the casino or the bar room and they're saying, let's stop at Medford at Casa Pizza on the way home because it's right off of the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=284.966s">So</a> that's a concern that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=287.748s">And</a> so I was just wondering, is it mostly a business delivery? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=292.031s">Is</a> mostly a business walk-in? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=295.373s">And</a> maybe we can just provide some insight to that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=320.153s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=324.495s">So</a> would a delivery only restriction <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=329.201s">be</a> something that would be suitable from 11 to 2am without work for you, and then maybe on Friday and Saturday, allowing them to stay open till two o'clock in the morning for patrons as well something like that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=371.164s">That</a> sounds absolutely correct, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=373.686s">I'd</a> certainly support the application with those restrictions in the 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=377.147s">After</a> the 90-day review, if things are going good, then maybe we can move on some of those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=380.989s">But</a> I'd hate to go grant a full approval and then have them come back 90 days after operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=387.953s">Let's</a> maybe ease into this a little bit and take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=390.294s">And</a> at the 90-day review, if we can lift some of these restrictions or requirements, we might be in a better spot in protecting the neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=429.724s">I'd</a> often lose his conditions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9BRnpGt19U&t=434.228s">I'm</a> not a president.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=210.043s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=211.484s">Last</a> week, this item came up and I did a fairly poor job at explaining it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=216.369s">We</a> discussed ordinances and how ordinances are passed in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=219.993s">An</a> ordinance requires four votes to be passed in this community unless it's statutorily required otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=225.498s">and</a> the confusion was raised last week based upon the fact that I feel as though we need an opinion as to whether or not this section of the general laws applies when it comes to creating positions via ordinance and giving pay raises via ordinance and whether or not a two-thirds vote is required or a simple majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=242.338s">I've</a> had preliminary discussions with the city solicitor, who's indicated that she's 90% sure that it would be requiring a two thirds vote to pass these provisions that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=252.808s">Before</a> we go further and get the solicitor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=255.81s">I</a> do want to say that last week, things got a little out of hand a little crazy in terms of parliamentary procedure and the like and it was not my intention to create any type of confusion, but rather to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=266.16s">And</a> I know I have speaking with the chair that, you know, it could have been perceived that I was trying to take a shot at the chair and that wasn't my intention at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=275.806s">My</a> intention was to move forward on the paper and move forward appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=279.388s">As</a> I've said in the past we've all taken an oath. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=281.609s">We've</a> taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the ordinances of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=287.973s">And</a> I feel as though that's a paramount responsibility for every one of us behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=291.635s">And</a> when an issue like this comes up, when it comes to financial malfeasance or financial compliance, I feel as though it deserves strict scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=298.359s">That's</a> why I raised the issue this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=300.12s">That's</a> why I asked for the solicitor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=302.001s">And</a> that's why I've become so passionate about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=304.422s">There's</a> a taxpayer dollars that we're discussing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=307.344s">And</a> we're discussing taxpayer dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=309.925s">of</a> the utmost importance that we're complying with laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=312.666s">So</a> with that being said, through the chair, it was not my intention to create confusion or to implement any delay tactics. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=319.229s">What</a> it was, was to create clarification to be sure that as we move forward, we do the right thing, we comply with the law, we get an opinion from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=326.512s">So</a> for the rest of the term, we don't need to think about this stuff anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=329.413s">So</a> that's where this comes from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=331.734s">I</a> again, ask the solicitor for an opinion as to whether or not these papers before us would require the two thirds of the simple majority <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=338.317s">and</a> she's informed me that she'll be able to give us an opinion later on in the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=341.539s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to approve this measure so it can officially be sent to her office for an official opinion back to the council, as opposed to an opinion to an individual Councilor who gave her the heads up because it was something I put on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=371.114s">Well,</a> the paper speaks for itself, the clarification piece was whether or not the two thirds vote will comply, I mean ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=377.596s">The</a> question is, is the city of medford in compliance with the aforementioned provisions if we don't vote on it, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=384.057s">didn't</a> do anything so yeah we're in compliance right it's whether or not when we when we take the boat in the action now we need compliance right so i think that the question is um you know where the paper is put forward in a fashion that will comply with the financial requirements that are outlined in this in this question um and whether or not um we need four or five votes to pass the provisions that are before us
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1156.501s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much when we look at this, it's amazing to see that Lawrence Memorial Hospital got such great grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1162.469s">When</a> you look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1165.132s">The</a> grading system of the 100 best hospitals in America looking at the way they provide care for Medicaid patients and seeing the Lawrence Memorial Hospital falls in the top three in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1175.558s">And</a> when we talk about Medicaid patients, who are those people? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1177.799s">Those</a> are people aged 65 and older or under age 65 and disabled or suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease or end stage renal failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1185.423s">Individuals</a> that are the most vulnerable in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1187.884s">So</a> it's great to see Lawrence Memorial Hospital transitioning through a period of time where they were struggling and being able to move into a spot where <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1195.572s">They're</a> able to provide outstanding patient care and they're being recognized far and nationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1199.575s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I might ask that this matter be approved by my council colleagues and that our friends at Lawrence Memorial Hospital be invited down to receive an official commendation commemorating this wonderful achievement that we also ask our state delegation to come down and join us in the celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1216.446s">I</a> think that we as residents of Metro take for granted how lucky we are to have a hospital and a university in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1223.708s">The</a> hospital and the university both provide great, great assets to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1227.149s">They</a> provide us with the ability to be stable during difficult times, and it's great to see the success continuing on at Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1234.11s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1255.118s">Just</a> because it's curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1256.458s">I</a> mean, just because it doesn't have an emergency room doesn't mean it's not a hospital.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1260.019s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1260.419s">So,</a> you know, New England Baptist is a hospital, but they don't have an emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1267.021s">So,</a> you know, I think it's very similar around the level of care that they provide a hospital level services. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1271.401s">They</a> just don't have the emergency room.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1274.721s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1607.222s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1608.683s">This</a> is the car wash that was formerly known as Randy's on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1613.762s">And</a> they're a special permit holder relative to assign variants. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1617.671s">And</a> what's going on in that parking lot is that there's been an inordinate amount of traffic gridlocking. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1625.002s">noxious</a> amount of noise acoustics loud music and the like being played over exterior PA systems and accidents in the parking lot that have warranted police involvement and submissions with the neighbors concerning access to their facilities and businesses that share the entrance and exit to that strip mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1644.106s">So</a> with this being said, I'm hoping that we can have these individuals from prestige car wash come in and sit before our subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1651.008s">on</a> signage to discuss some of the ways that we can improve the signage that we have out there to prevent gridwalking and to improve the flow of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1658.236s">For</a> example, maybe entrance only one way, exit only another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1662.54s">Just</a> some little low-hanging fruit ideas that we can improve what's going on in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1667.345s">Because</a> they offer free vacuums this time of year especially, what happens is they have VIP membership and regular membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1673.273s">And</a> if you're a VIP, what happens is just like getting on the plane at the airport, you get to cut the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1677.897s">So</a> you could have people sitting in line, 15 minutes, then next in line, VIP comes in, goes right in front of them and goes to the vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1685.123s">So</a> what's happening is these people are sitting in queue for an inordinate amount of time, building up into the main drag and the thoroughfare and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1692.309s">So</a> I'm asking my council colleagues to support the resolution and see if we can do a little bit of work to provide some neighborhood relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1699.095s">Thank</a> you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=1699.875s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2107.283s">You</a> wanna go? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2108.184s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2108.764s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2111.727s">So</a> let's look at this a little bit, because I think this is craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2117.972s">We</a> have Shavire Auditorium, which is a city-owned asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2123.016s">We</a> have Bill Blumenreich Presents, which is a vendor that the city has contracted with after issuing an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2132.163s">We</a> have this individual in the last year of his contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2139.114s">And</a> we have what we've all stuck our chest out and pat ourselves on the back about the success of the Cheviro auditorium right. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2147.864s">So</a> here we are, this console Scarpelli said the crown jewel of Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2154.051s">And</a> we're letting a vendor in the last year of his contract, take the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2159.069s">We're</a> letting a vendor in the last year of his contract take the lead on the economic future and the economic stability of the crown jewel of our Tata district. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2168.146s">This</a> is insanity to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2169.96s">This</a> is absolute insanity to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2171.681s">The</a> man needs to make up her mind and take a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2173.762s">Read</a> the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2175.083s">Does</a> the agreement say if this bridge is being built, it will be in violation of the agreement? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2178.765s">And</a> if it is, get a lawyer and file suit. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2182.487s">I'm</a> so sick and tired of listening to, well, we have this law firm for this, and we have this law firm for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2187.069s">We're</a> hiring law firms all over the place, and we're not investing in homegrown talent. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2190.631s">So</a> anytime an issue like this comes up, where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2193.212s">We're</a> sitting on our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2194.965s">looking</a> for direction, looking for help, waiting for someone to bail us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2198.486s">It's</a> not fair that Bill Blumenrecht, our vendor, is sitting here trying to bail us out of this gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2203.929s">This</a> is a city problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2205.529s">The</a> city should take leadership on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2208.47s">2,500,</a> I have no problem voting for 2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2210.091s">I'll</a> give them the three hours of legal work at $800 an hour that they're gonna do for 2,500 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2217.534s">The</a> city should be driving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2220.115s">I</a> said it last time and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2222.168s">This</a> is a wait and see approach to sit on your hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2224.809s">So</a> what happens is, well, we tried and it failed, but it's not my fault, it's Bill Blumenreich's fault, he took the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2231.35s">Own</a> the issue, be accountable, show leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2235.371s">This</a> is supposed to be our crown jewel, our greatest achievement, Chevalier Auditorium, breathing life back into our downtowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2244.696s">This</a> isn't the way to defend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2246.617s">This</a> certainly isn't the way to grow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2248.499s">And</a> this certainly isn't the way to show a partnership with our vendor, who's invested a ton of money in making it successful down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2255.083s">We</a> need to take the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2256.844s">We</a> need to be the ones driving the ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2259.046s">I'm</a> so sick and tired of taking the wait and see approach, the lack of leadership, the follow the leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2264.95s">On</a> something like this, something as simple as this, well, we all know this is the best thing that's happened to Medford Square in 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2271.922s">A</a> measly $2,500, and we can't even get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2275.727s">We</a> should have Brown, Rudnick, and Golston in stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2279.711s">Farm</a> retainer signed that filing suit right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2284.423s">I</a> appreciate you for entertaining my rant, I did my best Councilor max impersonation there. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2289.688s">I'm</a> getting a little passionate about the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2292.211s">And</a> I miss my friend daily. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2294.033s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to the count my constant quality for bringing this measure forward, I will be supporting it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=2944.047s">And</a> secondly, some of us are confused, the ground with gold cinder blocks if they can get this thing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3545.893s">I</a> respect the work of the chairman, but you know, when we're looking at an issue like this, legal strategy is what we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3553.839s">We</a> need legal strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3555.804s">And</a> I know that the commission's made up of a number of great individuals that do a lot of work in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3560.385s">I</a> don't know how many of them are lawyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3563.546s">I</a> don't know how many of them have expertise in contract law and dealing with issues like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3570.627s">And</a> I think that that's where the council's concern is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3575.049s">Like,</a> we don't care about the drop in the bucket, 2,500 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3578.409s">We</a> care about the long-term impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3579.91s">Bill</a> Blumenreich's contract is up in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3582.35s">And</a> he says, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3584.411s">Encore's</a> happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3586.39s">It's</a> just not, I'm just not in it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3587.952s">There's</a> nothing, nothing here for me and he walks. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3589.995s">What</a> happens to our case? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3592.618s">What</a> happens to our case if Bill decides he doesn't want to renew and he walks and we're in the middle of litigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=3596.584s">I</a> think that's the big concern that I have.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5007.772s">Does</a> anyone... I'm aware of at least 20 labor charges and three MCAD complaints pending at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5041.496s">There's</a> over 20 labor charges filed anyway, for failure to negotiate, violation of rights and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5050.541s">And</a> then it's my understanding there's at least three MCAD complaints that are pending.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5077.388s">Yeah,</a> with the labor charges alone, the labor charge is not even litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5080.649s">I</a> mean, that's pretty much just fighting with your employees.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5083.749s">Those</a> aren't lawsuits in court yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5094.268s">It's</a> administrative law, though, so it's not like, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5098.029s">It</a> has to go through the Administrative Tribunal first. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5100.39s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5167.437s">John,</a> let's not get the political data confused with the political reality, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5171.819s">The</a> name of the position was whenever they were going to call it to see what they could do to get it passed, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5176.541s">Ultimately,</a> the roles and responsibilities were going to be the same no matter what they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/NqJnNNyD4Uw&t=5180.183s">But</a> they just wanted to change the name to see if the name was going to change the temperature of the council to get it passed at the time.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw/2024-11-19_s4ePTNAg4Nw.html">City Council 02-08-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=116.409s">Anytime</a> that a motion's been made on the floor, communication with the city staff should come directly to the council until the individual constantly constantly made the motion right so ultimately, last week I raised the question as to whether or not this is a use that would have to go to our community development boards outline the chapter 94 of our zoning act. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=132.621s">And</a> I asked the question as to whether or not this is one of those uses because the paper before us didn't say what the use was that we were voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=140.527s">So</a> the question would then come from this council to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=144.129s">The</a> administration would assign it to a council, to a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=147.21s">The</a> staff member would report back to this council via the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=150.091s">I</a> haven't received any correspondence or communication relative to this subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=153.772s">I</a> don't know if my colleagues have or if the clerk has.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=174.145s">Right,</a> the question was whether or not it wasn't whether it wasn't allowed to use because a special permit right, it was allowed to use special permits before us the question was whether or not to go to the CD board before the council voted on it pursuant to 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=185.69s">9481B</a> of the Zoning Act.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=361.992s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=363.272s">Although</a> I did not know Mr. Palmisano. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=364.793s">Well,</a> he was a neighbor of mine grew up around the corner from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=367.273s">And</a> he was always a gentleman that was well respected in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=370.274s">If</a> he's anything like his son Carmen, then we know that he's a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=373.318s">His</a> son Carmen and I have become friends over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=375.621s">Carmen</a> carries himself as such a gentleman that it's only fitting to say it's a reflection of his father. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=381.108s">And</a> recently the city of Medford lost Mr. Parmesano, and I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deep and sincere condolences to the family of a lifelong Metro resident.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1255.733s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1256.993s">And</a> looking at section two of this paper that's before us this evening, this proposal, it says the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards and one elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1267.818s">This</a> paper also says that this charter review is being brought forward underneath chapter 43B of the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1274.72s">If</a> we look at section six of chapter 43B of the general laws, it says the charter commission shall consist of nine registered voters of the city or town elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1285.461s">So</a> it sounds to me like we have a conflict of language here right now, Mr. President, with the paper that's before us versus the plain language of the state law that governs charter review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1779.755s">With</a> all due respect, this council for three years has been beating our chest, screaming and yelling for legal representation, and now we're getting asked to schedule our meetings around the lawyers at KP Law that we haven't been able to meet with for two and a half years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2753.459s">It's</a> not about the license, it's about the process that we need to take as a body to be sure that we're compliant with the law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3002.612s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3003.934s">Not</a> one of my normal resolutions that I put on, but I did get a call from a number of concerned citizens who were out walking their little pups and they had questions and concern as to whether or not the salt mix that the city was using was pet environmentally friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3017.024s">So</a> with that being said, I said I'll get an answer for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3019.366s">This</a> is the approach that I'm taking to get such. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3020.967s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and hopefully the answer is yes, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3027.733s">Very</a> pessimistic about that being the case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3128.49s">Relatively</a> self explanatory Mr. President, this is a resolution that was put forward and passed by the previous council unanimously seven to nothing in April of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3137.233s">I'm</a> at that time this council struggling with the effects of the pandemic, we provided a draft resolution to solicitors office and we asked them to craft a resolution that would fit Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3146.817s">The</a> reason we asked for this was because of the impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3149.418s">that</a> the pandemic was having on the youth in our community, their ability to interact, the mental health pressures that they're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3154.701s">Today,</a> we still have not seen a draft ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3156.782s">I'm</a> hoping this is something that we can get in short order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3160.643s">April,</a> May, June, we're getting there, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3163.305s">It's</a> almost the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3164.325s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3168.727s">Councilor</a> Tseng.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3847.283s">Any</a> further discussion, if I may, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3849.504s">Yes,</a> I'd like to make a public service announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3852.717s">There's</a> gonna be two feet of snow, there's gonna be a snow emergency, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3856.178s">So,</a> temporary signs, we don't need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3858.699s">If</a> two feet of snow is coming, we're gonna be in a snow emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3863.3s">That</a> goes without saying.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3873.103s">Yeah,</a> winter starts in December, man. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3875.164s">Don't</a> you live here?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3880.987s">But</a> ultimately, there's one thing I think that a lot of people don't do anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3885.93s">And</a> it's this crazy thing, they pick up the phone and they call somebody and they ask a question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3890.053s">Like</a> call the police department and say, is it a snow emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3892.935s">And</a> what side of the street am I supposed to park on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3894.997s">A</a> lot of people are afraid to pick up the phone these days and call, but we have great resources here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3899.54s">The</a> police department staff 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3901.401s">We</a> have somebody at the police department that's in dispatch that could always answer a question if anybody has a question about where I went to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3906.565s">And</a> we also have the night watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3908.246s">The</a> night watchman in the DPW is also available to address questions and concerns like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3912.93s">So</a> there are resources out there for individuals in this community that have questions about where to park during snow emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3920.317s">The</a> DPWs during snow emergencies is operating 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3923.88s">So</a> there's always someone that's available to answer a call and answer a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3927.163s">So</a> with that being said, I hope that the individuals out there in the community that are having such difficulty <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3932.088s">figuring</a> out where to park, also take advantage of some of these old fashioned resources, like not signing up for alerts, but picking up the phone and asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3939.152s">Does</a> that get you the same answer?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4498.354s">Mr.</a> President, I think, if my memory serves me correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4503.697s">This</a> paper was put on in the council voted to request that the mayor write a letter to the Gaming Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4510.882s">The</a> mayor wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission reported back to the council that you wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission and suggested that we do so as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4519.011s">If</a> we're going to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, after we just directed the mayor to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, I think we need to be sure that we're consistent in our message. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4526.476s">If</a> we look at our agenda this evening, we want to send letters to every member of the State House, the Speaker, the Senate President, every member of our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4535.562s">We</a> want to send letters to the Mass Gaming Commission over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4538.044s">We're</a> like letter-writing nuts right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4540.746s">At</a> the end of the day, we need to have a concise and consistent message. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4543.91s">It</a> should be delivered as a city, not as one body in the city, this body in the city, we need to take a look at what the mayor wrote and craft a letter that shows some consistency, so that we're not asking for two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4555.885s">I</a> think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4557.326s">All</a> right, if we're going to be sending letters to places, we need to be sure that our game is tight, and that what we're asking for is what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4563.828s">It's</a> not for the cameras, it's for the policy, it's not for the politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4567.669s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4568.129s">I</a> mean, ultimately, that's what it comes down to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4570.63s">I</a> think that, you know, if we're going to be asking the Gaming Commission to take a stand, the stand that we're asking them to take can't be a stand of the city council, it can't be a stand of the administration, it has to be a stand of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4582.586s">stand</a> all of us together unified. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4584.767s">So</a> with that being said, I have no problem sending a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4586.888s">I</a> just wish that we could probably work with the administration a little bit more cooperatively in addressing large issues like this that are impacting our community, especially when the mayor's action came at the directive of the council in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4599.593s">So</a> with that being said, I support the intent of the paper, but I just want to be sure that what we're sending is a message of consistency. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4609.394s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=4610.416s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5115.219s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly support the theory of the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5118.982s">I</a> certainly support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5120.003s">It's</a> something that's very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5121.704s">I</a> question whether or not it needs to be reviewed by the solicitor or whether this came from legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5126.888s">Maybe</a> the other sponsor of the resolution can offer that this has been worked on through legal counsel of some shape or form, maybe with UFCW.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5312.592s">Any</a> further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5313.552s">Mr.</a> President, that highlights some of the questions that I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5315.993s">It's</a> certainly an interesting theory that the council can tie licensure requirements to union membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5324.414s">It's</a> very interesting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5370.515s">I</a> was referring to wasn't the peace agreement, but rather the requirement that a project labor agreement be in place.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5379.028s">Yeah,</a> so I mean, Mr. Camacho I know you don't know me from a hole in the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5382.449s">I</a> came from the unions I worked at SIU for a number of years I negotiated over 40 contracts I represented close to 12,000 employees between Worcester and Essex County and Suffolk County and Middlesex County so I've certainly been familiar with the union world and it's something that I certainly want to support but like Councilor Behr said if we're going to do it let's do it right and if you like what you said if we're going to do it let's do it right so I just want to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5406.736s">We</a> don't get challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5407.637s">We're</a> in a process right now where it's taken probably, we're probably the slowest community in all the world to license the marijuana facility in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5417.347s">And</a> we've gotten this far, and I'd hate to see the process stalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5421.912s">The</a> administration's done a great job of doing that already. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5424.435s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5426.237s">I</a> support working families. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5427.771s">And</a> I always will. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5428.671s">If</a> you don't know what you stand for, then you can't stand for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5431.273s">This</a> is certainly something that I stand for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5433.073s">I</a> stand for good wages. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5434.134s">I</a> stand for health benefits, retirement benefits for workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5436.475s">I</a> stand for a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5438.295s">I</a> think that these are things that bring our community up, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5441.177s">If</a> we have good wages in the community, then people can spend their ancillary money in the circular flow of our economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5446.039s">The</a> discretionary funds go back into our economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5448.119s">It's</a> a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5449.3s">So</a> with that being said, I support this wholeheartedly and I have no problem seconding the motion by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5453.882s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5533.069s">Because</a> it's a zoning paper, Mr. President, and we have a zoning codification issue that's coming up, it doesn't have to be part of the codification. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5539.25s">It</a> can go through as an amendment to the existing zoning ordinance for the cannabis licensure, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5546.592s">And</a> it can go through the process itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5548.153s">In</a> fact, we have to do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5549.813s">We</a> don't have to tie it to the recodification and blow that thing up, you know what I mean, as we're going through the process, because we're at the Penn Yard line.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5736.408s">We're</a> gonna have a motion to join it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5741.598s">And</a> then we vote on the motion to join it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5743.679s">And</a> then the motion goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5745.721s">You</a> really can't bring it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5780.125s">We'll</a> have the opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5781.166s">Well,</a> why don't we amend the paper to ask for a legal opinion on this language right here? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5784.768s">The</a> senator has a solicitor now, she'll get that back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5786.949s">That's</a> fine, yeah, that's fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5833.785s">One</a> major question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5844.458s">If</a> we want the solicitor to give us a legal opinion we need to ask the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5884.873s">That's</a> not a legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=5885.854s">That's</a> an operational question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6090.131s">Mr.</a> President, this gentleman works for the UFCW as a representative of a labor organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6094.394s">He's</a> not an entity with the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6098.517s">I'm</a> not sure- I assume.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6168.3s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6747.002s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6747.843s">I</a> would just like to reiterate my concern that this council's focus should be on the items that fall within its purview and control. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6754.807s">We</a> have a very, very responsible, receptive, and capable state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6760.21s">A</a> very, very capable state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6763.231s">We're</a> not the House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6765.292s">We're</a> not the Massachusetts Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6767.173s">Thousands</a> and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of bills are introduced every day in both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6772.506s">This</a> council is gonna sit here and spend our time weeding through those bills and not doing the job that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6778.009s">We're</a> doing something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6779.77s">We're</a> elected to do the city's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6782.451s">This</a> is State House talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6783.872s">For</a> this reason and this reason alone, I'm not gonna support this measure tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6787.654s">Week</a> in and week out, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6794.157s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6795.478s">They're</a> gonna think we're lunatics. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6797.583s">Every</a> other week, they're getting a letter from the Medford City Council saying, Medford wants this now, Medford wants that now, Medford wants this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6802.504s">This</a> guy in Medford, you know what I want? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6803.864s">More</a> money. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6804.844s">There's</a> one paper on this agenda this evening that I will support. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6809.065s">A</a> paper asking for an increase in House Fund funds to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6812.086s">I</a> will support that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6813.706s">But</a> as for us, continuously, week in and week out, supporting this piece of legislation, that piece of legislation, this piece of legislation at the State House, it's not moving this council forward, it's not moving this city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6824.608s">It's</a> moving an agenda forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=6826.513s">but</a> it's not moving us forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7514.039s">Mr.</a> President, from a procedural standpoint, there is a paper that's pending.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7519.98s">We'll</a> kind of put the cap before the horse, this is why I raised the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7632.996s">I</a> don't necessarily agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7635.418s">It's</a> our point of information is our point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7638.139s">Ultimately,</a> the paper that they have before me is asking whether or not the papers that we're going to be voting on that we just taken from the table are in compliance with the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7647.321s">So</a> if this paper wouldn't be moved, and we take a vote, and then the vote says that we're not in compliance with the general laws, I think it was a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7656.17s">And</a> that's just my understanding of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7658.573s">And</a> looking at the way that positions have been created and the way positions have been funded, I think we have a significant financial transparency issue, and I think we have a significant financial compliance issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7669.028s">especially</a> with chapter 44 section 33a related to the human resource directors position and potentially these as well that are outlined in this paper and that's why I raised the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7677.676s">Everybody</a> behind this rail took an oath. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7679.497s">Part</a> of that oath was to uphold the rules of the constitution, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ordinances of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7686.403s">I</a> don't think anybody behind this rail can answer the question as to whether or not the city of Medford is in compliance with chapter 44 section 33a. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7693.356s">Quite</a> frankly, I don't think our CFO can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7696.418s">But</a> I do raise the question because if I'm going to be taking a vote and putting my name on it, I want that vote to be in line with the oath I took. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7702.722s">That's</a> why I've asked for this paper to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7705.123s">I</a> won't be supporting the three papers that are before me this evening because this paper, I think, addresses a lot of the questions that have been raised over duration relative to the compensation adjustment factor system and the approach that the administration is taking.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7745.622s">This</a> is an ordinance for third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7747.503s">It</a> will need five votes for passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7749.024s">Failure</a> to pass will result in the paper being tabled for a period of 90 days and not being able to be reintroduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7756.886s">What</a> role is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7757.967s">It's</a> an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7759.187s">An</a> ordinance is required five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7760.727s">So</a> if this doesn't pass, then it fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7762.448s">And</a> if the paper fails, it's been disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7764.089s">And</a> if it's disposed of, the paper can't be reintroduced to the council for a period of 90 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7773.272s">It's</a> 44. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7775.009s">Look</a> at this chapter 44.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7780.576s">If</a> we had legal counsel, it'd be like this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7789.188s">You</a> need four to take off effectively.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7818.323s">It's</a> chapter 44. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7819.423s">It'd</a> be around section 18 or 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7824.366s">I</a> think section 22 has to do with the financial paper being tabled initially. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7831.529s">Section</a> 134, administration of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7833.57s">Chapter</a> 43 is for finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7835.031s">Off</a> hand, no. But I know I'm right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7849.667s">Would</a> somebody like to call President Demeritus, Robert Mayorko?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=7884.311s">I'm</a> not challenging the ruling of the chair.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8169.229s">To</a> permit a member voting present when the motion order resolution under consideration by the council forbid his or her participation as the conflict interest of law directs such members should do so should should so address the council in the chair and for me as to why the Councilor is voting president present. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8187.321s">I</a> don't think there's anything in here that says you can vote present unless I think you have to vote unless you have a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8192.569s">There's</a> a rule in there and I think that that's not it, as I look at it, but from what I understand.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8207.925s">It</a> happened again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8350.833s">I'll</a> be happy to move for reconsideration should the paper come back requiring five votes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8358.018s">I</a> will for reconsideration put it back on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8359.639s">I</a> have no problem with that, but you're saying that I lost the vote, so I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8363.2s">I</a> can only move for reconsideration if I won the vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8379.487s">Move</a> for reconsideration on the paper and then ask that it be tabled and then we'd say yes and yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8384.448s">We</a> move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8549.341s">It's</a> a public information paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8551.782s">It's</a> a public participation paper that has no number. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8554.082s">So</a> the clerk has the authority to include it on the agenda next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8558.044s">The</a> council doesn't take action on those papers anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8560.104s">We</a> just sit there and listen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8561.064s">And</a> then it's up to us to take an action on it the next week, the following week to comply with OML. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=8564.945s">So</a> the clerk can just reissue that.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_OV8H6CfzDMQ/2024-11-19_OV8H6CfzDMQ.html">City Council 02-01-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=187.536s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=189.577s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=276.195s">I</a> move approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=280.415s">I</a> think we all know what a great man Mr. Bates was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=337.84s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=342.723s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=584.619s">Mr.</a> President, I do have a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=589.219s">What</a> is the proposed use that's warranting the council to review for special permit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=600.021s">The</a> reason I ask is because if you look at our zoning ordinance, it says if we get an application for certain uses, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=606.469s">uses</a> 12, 22, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 33, 34, and 49A, those matters should go to the community development board before the council takes a vote on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=618.22s">So</a> in terms of just compliance with the law, I was just wondering where we were on that, if this in fact was an application for one of those items.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=639.958s">I</a> think that would be more of a question for the building commissioner or the city solicitor than this gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=644.92s">I</a> think he's just an applicant and the use is really not something that he'd be classifying his facility within a table of use chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=655.045s">That</a> would be a determination that would be made by the building commissioner.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=793.37s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=794.511s">If</a> we're going to ask the question to the city solicitor, I think we better put it in appropriate terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=801.355s">The</a> question to the solicitor would be, does this application fall within the scope of section 94-81 subsection B of the Medford zoning ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=823.568s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1446.258s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1750.618s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1751.959s">I</a> certainly have no problem supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1754.861s">I</a> would like to remind everybody that no piece of legislation comes out the way it goes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1760.225s">And</a> when we look at what's going on at the State House, we'll see that there are thousands and thousands of bills that are filed every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1766.15s">And</a> if this council is going to be focused on our goals and priorities, I think our goals and priorities should be that that fall within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1773.095s">However,</a> this is a meritorious resolution that I will have no problem supporting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1777.838s">However,</a> I do want us to earn the side of caution and to move forward in a fashion where we're not taking up items that we are dealing with the deal with the state legislature when we elected a state legislature to do that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1788.648s">I</a> think we have a very capable representation up on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1792.511s">And</a> if we're going to be taking up state items and state bills every week, it's going to make for very long and unproductive sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1800.539s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly will support this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1804.583s">However,</a> I'd hate to see this become a trend of every week that we're sitting here, voicing support for this piece of legislation and that piece of legislation that's outside of scope and purview of authority.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1992.021s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President and through you to Linda, Paula and Patty. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=1997.538s">who</a> I've been fortunate enough to develop a great friendship with over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2001.76s">Thank</a> you for the work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2004.381s">I've</a> been a strong advocate for the Consumer Office since my election to the City Council, and I've always felt that they were the unsung heroes in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2012.806s">These</a> individuals are trained by the Attorney General to handle consumer complaints and disputes. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2019.109s">They</a> do an excellent job in resolving matters of <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2025.195s">anything</a> from scams to the cold cut machine, not being accurate at the supermarket and you overpaying, um, they've done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2033.882s">And,</a> um, one thing I know about the three of these women is that they really loved what they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2038.345s">They</a> really loved their job so much so that, um, when the state grant was cut, um, the ladies worked out a job sharing schedule so that nobody would lose their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2051.676s">They</a> were truly a group of people that cared about each other and worked together as a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2056.238s">This</a> office was created in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2058.64s">It</a> was created as the benefit consumer commission and its first commissioner was the late great Michael Callahan, our governor's Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2067.764s">And</a> Michael took great pride in this office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2070.746s">And</a> he was one of his greatest accomplishments in his 50 years of government service. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2074.828s">And</a> when you look at what's going on from a human resource standpoint in city hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2084.032s">Look</a> it, three individuals with 90 years of combined service don't just walk out the door on the same day because they're happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2091.575s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2092.536s">I</a> wish them the best of luck in their retirement, but we need to get to the bottom of what's going on in Medford City Hall, because it's getting to be embarrassing. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2099.899s">I</a> heard this morning another employee was escorted off the premises and told that they need to submit to a psychological evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2107.562s">I've</a> been told that these three individuals were told that they need to be replaced with younger and more energetic employees, which led <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2113.985s">to</a> really a retirement in duress. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2117.848s">So</a> while I don't want to rain on the parade of the great work that these three individuals have done in the community, I also think that we as a council owe it to them to investigate as to what's going on and to why the three of them would have left on the same day so abruptly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2133.861s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2136.503s">I</a> thank them for their service and I congratulate them on their retirement, wish them the best and let them know that they always have a friend in me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2520.069s">Does</a> the sponsor of this resolution have any idea if this will impact the MBTA assessment on the city of medicine. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2530.034s">I</a> don't know it sounds like it's going to cost about a billion bucks and pretty sure we're going to be caught paying for it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2571.068s">That</a> would probably come from the MBTA advisory board if the measure passed and was ever ended up funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2578.572s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2579.632s">Number</a> two, the governor's budget has come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2583.334s">The</a> governor's budget is not that pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2586.8s">Um,</a> again, if we're going to be sending letters up to the state house, I think the letters that we should be sending up to the state house, they give us more chapter 90 money, give us more local aid money, give us more money for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2597.065s">Um,</a> and you know, when you give everybody a, when you ask, when you ask for two slices and you get a half a slice, you can't complain. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2605.988s">Um,</a> but if he asked for one slice and you only, you know, you only give them an option to give you one slice, then, um, you gotta, you're in a better position of power from negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2614.032s">Um,</a> so I'd hate to see us be in a situation where we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2616.948s">sending</a> letters up to every single chairman up in the state house, asking for this and asking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2620.97s">And</a> at the end of the day, we're passing a ceremonious legislation and we're not cashing in on our ability to get the big bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2628.913s">Um,</a> you know, it's a great, great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2631.074s">You</a> know, something that certainly, uh, uh, sounds like a pie in the sky, um, possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2638.397s">Um,</a> but you know, it's going to have to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2640.718s">It's</a> not going to be funded, um, through the forward funding mechanism that they have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2645.588s">through</a> the sales tax because it's going to cost way too much to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2648.67s">So</a> it's going to come down to an assessment on our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2651.251s">So</a> there will be a financial impact there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2653.132s">As</a> Councilor Caraviello did say, our community is super assessed when it comes to the MBTA and our services are lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2659.816s">We've</a> seen service cuts across the board from bus service to commuter rail service to express bus service. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2665.379s">So,</a> you know, that's something to think about, you know, are we going to ask for more, pay for more and get less. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2670.743s">Is</a> that something we want? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2672.345s">But</a> it also has environmental and economical impacts that will, you know, make a difference here in our community from a public health standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2682.034s">So</a> it's something we need to think about in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=2684.456s">That's</a> why we have a state legislature.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3334.431s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3335.831s">I</a> think it's important when we look at this, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3338.267s">resolution</a> what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3339.988s">It</a> says celebrate and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3342.029s">Now,</a> when we talk about the debate and discussion that we've had over a resolution that's asked for us to celebrate and support something versus what we did in our first four meetings, I think we spent 3 million bucks in our first four meetings and we've talked less about it than we've talked about this topic right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3356.819s">Okay,</a> so it's a resolution that's symbolic in nature that says let's celebrate and support this unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3365.184s">And</a> I certainly don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3367.542s">But</a> what I do have a problem with is that the budget has been passed now for quite a bit of time and we still don't have a director of diversity in the school department or on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3378.648s">So,</a> you know, when we talk about things, let's really talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3382.77s">Let's,</a> let's, let's, let's put the issues out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3385.151s">Let's</a> lay it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3386.692s">You</a> know, we still don't have a diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3389.394s">We</a> still don't have a diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3391.135s">It's</a> been three years, no diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3396.742s">So</a> if we're going to make the commitment, let's really make the commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3399.083s">If</a> we're going to talk about it, let's walk about it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3402.464s">That's</a> where I'm coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3403.784s">So</a> I certainly support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3405.145s">I</a> have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3405.945s">Like</a> I said, it's a resolution that asks us to support something. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3410.327s">I</a> have no problem doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3411.987s">Um,</a> so for that reason, I'll be voting for that this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3472.779s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3473.839s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, I think, you know, when we look at traditionally this administration's personnel functions and the way that they go about it, <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3482.096s">They</a> haven't had any problem bringing back all three employees, retired employees, to perform these functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3487.418s">We</a> looked at what went on in the treasurer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3489.339s">We're</a> looking at what's going on in the CFO's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3491.859s">I</a> mean, we're bringing back part-time retirees to fill these positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3495.901s">Why</a> aren't we doing that in the diversity office too? <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3498.602s">Why</a> is that office less important than these other offices?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3577.922s">Eight</a> months. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=3582.384s">Eight</a> months, we're gonna be on the next fiscal year's budget pretty soon.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4070.199s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4095.72s">It's</a> quite lengthy, so- Rick, it might be easier if you read it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4903.095s">Which</a> is the first paper's positions?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4934.028s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4935.629s">Mr.</a> President, can I request that we keep these on the table for one more week, just so I can have an opportunity to review the paperwork again. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4942.331s">I'm</a> a little confused as to what's before us this evening and where we're taking it off the table without the papers in front of us and just like for the professional courtesy to have one more week to take a review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4958.478s">It's</a> more of a request, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=4960.558s">It's</a> more of a request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5010.01s">Just</a> say no and push the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5010.991s">I'll</a> vote against it and you guys can get what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5013.847s">I</a> mean, at the end of the day, when we're talking about urgency, we've had the diversity director's position that's been vacant friggin' for 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5021.491s">So,</a> you know, I think that, you know, when we're gonna sit here and we're gonna worry about urgency, I don't think that that urgency is shared all the time with colleagues in government across the hallway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5049.981s">And</a> the only reason I ask is because I voted. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5052.884s">Differently</a> on both papers, so I just want to be sure that I can have the opportunity again to review them and be consistent in my efforts as I go forward in the
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5080.704s">Just</a> withdraw the motion and we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5082.645s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5091.507s">Just</a> withdraw the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5093.548s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5100.391s">So</a> you want to bring it back up next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5238.211s">Maybe</a> we can refer that to the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5248.618s">Yeah,</a> it's still the Office of Community Development to me, whatever they want to call it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OV8H6CfzDMQ&t=5269.885s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_muHlZXB81Bw/2024-11-19_muHlZXB81Bw.html">City Council 01-25-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=77.0s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much and I know that you and I was supposed to be co sponsors on this I apologize for leaving you off. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=82.988s">I</a> know that you and I spoke about. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=86.751s">But</a> it's the Sobato family are owners and operators of Expressos pizzeria on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=90.854s">Mr.</a> President, but just that just closed very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=94.336s">And</a> for 40 years they operated at that corner and they were one of the first businesses in this community to get an extended hours license. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=101.661s">And</a> they really set a trend up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=102.962s">They</a> serviced my neighborhood that I grew up in, as well as I'm sure Councilor Collins will tell us, Tufts University population for a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=109.868s">But</a> they've always been a great neighbor and a great partner in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=112.57s">And</a> after 40 years, they're hanging up the aprons and the pizza wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=115.892s">So</a> I think it goes without saying that they deserve some recognition for the community building that they did here in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=121.756s">And</a> they've offered this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=124.118s">They're</a> great people, a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=125.519s">I</a> had the opportunity to grow up with some nephews, some of our nephews in the Davises as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=130.042s">great</a> kids, great people, all giving to this community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=133.363s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution and send it to the administration for the request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=174.104s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=267.997s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=268.778s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=270.139s">I've</a> gotten a number of complaints recently from members of the community seeking copies of minutes or copies of meetings related to especially the Cannabis Advisory Commission as well as the Historic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=281.589s">And</a> these documents or records are not available readily on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=284.972s">So</a> after multiple calls, I thought it might make sense for us to reach out to the administration and ask them to take the appropriate steps to ensure that this material gets posted publicly and transparently, and that the council take the appropriate steps to ensure that this is a standard and a norm, not an anomaly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=357.152s">We</a> certainly have no problem with that, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=414.758s">Council</a> night, Mister President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=417.299s">Yes,</a> yet again, a nice personnel issue has made its way to the newspaper that's identified a number of issues that are going on here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=424.862s">One</a> of those issues, I believe, would be an IP vulnerability. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=427.883s">It's</a> my understanding that our IT director, after 24 years of employment in the city of Medford with an exemplary record, was removed from his position based upon some certain IT vulnerabilities that the council has not been made aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=440.287s">This</a> is very concerning to me, Mr. President, because of their IT vulnerabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=445.272s">Similar</a> to what we saw in the past, the administration wouldn't disclose to us when the number of personal information was taken from the city website maybe nine or 10 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=453.919s">It</a> just raises cause for concern, number one, and it also raises cause for liability for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=461.805s">And</a> if there's going to be a liability that's placed upon the city, it's going to end up costing the city money, and the council should know about it, because we're the steward of the taxpayer dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=469.193s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this motion to move forward that we set up an executive session with the city administration for us to discuss these it vulnerabilities to see what steps we need to take to ensure that the personal information and data of the taxpayers in this community is protected appropriately.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=483.662s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=563.501s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=565.001s">Litigation</a> and representation has been the topic of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=568.962s">Most</a> of those terms so far, Mr. President, for the last four or five weeks, that's all we've been talking about is litigation and representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=575.425s">And</a> recently, this council passed a money bill to amend the fiscal year budget to allow the mayor's private legal counsel to really have an open checkbook for litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=590.023s">And</a> when we look at what's going on here in the community and you think about the litigation that's pending, <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=594.426s">and</a> the amount of money that's been appropriated, and whether or not that amount of money is going to be able to stretch to cover the issues that are in dispute right now, it raises some concern for me financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=604.951s">So</a> when you think about the more than 25 labor charges that are against the city right now, when you think about the 340 developments that the city's fighting right now, that doesn't look like we're fighting a winning battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=616.936s">When</a> you look at the potential <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=619.552s">issue</a> with the cannabis advisory commission in the conflict of interest concerning one of the members of the selection committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=626.135s">It</a> just puts me in a position as the president to sit here and think about what we're doing with our money and whether or not we should be planning appropriately for future spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=636.38s">You</a> know since this term started I think we've spent a lot of dough in 4 or 5 weeks and I'm hoping that you know we can kind of responsibly manage <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=649.048s">our</a> budgets, our plans, our finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=651.829s">And</a> I think that by establishing a subcommittee on litigation, that will give the council a better idea going forward as to what steps we need to take to fund the law department in an appropriate fashion to ensure that we secure our legal representation moving forward, to be sure that we secure our zoning consultant moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=668.675s">So</a> I think that this will help us address a number of the concerns and issues that we've raised, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=672.276s">May</a> I ask for my council colleagues' support?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=707.612s">If</a> I'm with me, I know that the president's strong pencil also has the power to strike and create the subcommittees as we discussed at the beginning of the session, but I personally have no objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=719.156s">What</a> direction this council chooses to go with that direction, I want to go for transparency purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=723.578s">So</a> be it, I have no problem with that whatsoever.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=808.971s">Paper</a> 22054 offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=812.793s">Be</a> it resolved the Medford City Council will have the mayor start looking into purchasing vehicles for the Medford Police Department, most patrol cars are now four plus years old with high mileage. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=820.656s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1357.898s">seven</a> the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes Council paper to to 055 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved the city council request the administration please provide the council with the findings of its review of the clerk's office along with all legal costs associated Councilor caveat.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1570.95s">Oh,</a> this is an appropriation request that I support wholeheartedly I certainly have no problem with the appropriations that are requested here by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1579.253s">In</a> particular, the walking clock project, I think we're very lucky to have Jeffrey Driscoll running the Metro Housing Authority, the premier housing authority director in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1587.956s">He's</a> the housing authority director that trains the other housing authority directors across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1592.737s">He's</a> done an excellent job he's really. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1595.936s">moved</a> our housing authority forward, very similar to the way that Mike Durham has moved that veterans office forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1600.937s">He's</a> done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1602.197s">And</a> I've been looking at this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1603.918s">I</a> think this is what the CPA is really intended for. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1607.738s">It's</a> a perfect use. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1609.119s">So</a> with that being said, I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1611.339s">In</a> terms of the Riverbed Park project and the accessibility improvements to Chevallier Auditorium, again, two items that we've been talking about for a long time, two things that I think are important to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/muHlZXB81Bw&t=1622.501s">So</a> without being said, I'd move for approval on the table.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_cxtnrZly_dE/2024-11-19_cxtnrZly_dE.html">City Council 01-18-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=120.407s">Yes,</a> Mister president, I do think this paper is rather self explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=123.11s">We</a> do a pending litigation right now with BJ's wholesale. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=126.354s">And</a> for that purpose, I'd call for executive session for us to get an update from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=129.898s">So</a> where we stand the status of negotiations and the such. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=133.502s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=133.762s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=134.223s">Councilor</a> Kirby.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1004.403s">Yes,</a> that would be the. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1006.744s">Sorry,</a> what was that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1084.544s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1085.865s">So</a> the Goulding family of fixtures in the Lawrence Estates neighborhood of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1091.026s">find</a> Mrs. Goulding at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1092.267s">Joseph's</a> Parish every Sunday morning, praying for his son, Michael, who was a police officer for the better part of three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1098.93s">He</a> served here proudly and admirably in the city of Medford, starting off as a patrolman and rising through the ranks to that of lieutenant, at which time I had the opportunity to become the chief of the Western Police Department maybe, what was it, four years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1111.557s">And</a> he left us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1114.226s">Mike</a> left us and he went over to Western and me finished off a great career there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1118.347s">He's</a> sent him on that had given a lot to this community meant a lot to a lot of people in this community me being one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1124.629s">And</a> I'd asked my council colleagues to join in and not congratulating him in his retirement, it's not too often that we see one of our own rise to the level of chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1131.831s">These</a> jobs don't come up too often, there's only 300. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1134.913s">somewhat</a> cities and towns here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and for one of our homegrown talents to achieve such a great accolade and finish off his career at the pinnacle of where it could be is something that's admirable so I'd like to congratulate him on this achievement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1256.442s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much at the risk of repeating my entire speech from last week, I will move for approval as amended, I'd request that this be added on to the reports to section of the council agenda 30 days time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1319.902s">Able</a> to hold up these very important items of one through seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1324.016s">However,</a> I would be happy to put them on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1419.216s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1420.537s">This</a> was a several papers that came up at the close of last session. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1424.461s">But</a> as we have CPA discussion starting tomorrow I thought it would be prudent for us to keep this on the forefront of the front burner. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1431.908s">Ultimately,</a> we do have some physical plant requirements at Metro high school and in <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1436.767s">Last</a> week's packet, if you went through it, you would have found in there a petition from a number of individuals that utilize our pool facilities at the high school complaining of lack of hot water when they use the facilities, aside from the fact that that is probably the grossest thing in the world because there's probably a violation of <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1455.32s">What</a> about standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1456.861s">It's</a> something that needs to be fixed we have a state of the pool, we have a state of the art science lab state of the art fields, but we don't have hot water in the locker. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1464.486s">This</a> is something that should have been fixed long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1466.988s">And</a> the funding is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1468.368s">Why</a> don't we seek an eligibility determination from the CPA to see if in fact we can use those funds to address this very basic and simple maintenance request. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1478.105s">In</a> terms of the resurfacing of the field of dreams, there was discussion regarding the condition of the field of dreams and I know Councilor Scarpelli is far better versed at this than I am, but there is need for maintenance and upgrades at the field, and we've discussed a need for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1493.249s">And</a> again, CPC is an opportunity for us to pursue funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1497.253s">And</a> lastly, in our packet last week we also received a report from the home of the mission, aligning the physical plant requirements of one else stadium, and what we need to do an updated press box being one of the things they're right concessions them being another. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1513.536s">projects</a> that we want to undertake. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1515.837s">We</a> have a funding mechanism that's available for us in the CPC, so I'd ask that they also pursue an opportunity to see if they have eligibility for funds to pursue these endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1527.02s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the measure, requesting that these entities take the appropriate steps to determine whether or not they're eligible for the funds.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1622.102s">Yes,</a> Mister President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1623.683s">That</a> chapter of the general laws is what limits a municipal contract to no more than 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1628.806s">Just</a> recently, we heard that the city administration had entered into a contract for police body cameras, which is something I'm sure we're all very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1636.071s">However,</a> it was also brought up that this contract was a 60-month term, which raised the question as to whether or not this type of program would fall under Chapter <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1647.392s">30B</a> section 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=1648.473s">So</a> I'd like to ask the city solicitor whether or not this paper would require council approval to enter into a contract that exceeds the statutory term of 36 months.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2094.908s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2096.33s">As</a> I stated when we went through the whole entire situation, fiasco, whatever we want to call it, with the administration's actions to the Veterans Service Director, I took a position and that position was that I opposed the regionalization of the Veterans Service Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2111.204s">I</a> felt as though the City of Medford deserved to have <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2113.947s">a</a> dedicated representative for the veterans, and I feel as though Winchester's veterans deserve no less. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2119.989s">I</a> can understand where Councilor Caraviello is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2122.029s">I</a> understand that Winchester has a personnel problem, but they can't staff their position. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2126.31s">I</a> certainly have no problem with the City of Medford helping out, but I do want to be sure that the City of Medford remains the number one priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2132.932s">So</a> with that being said, regionalization is not something that I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2136.273s">I'm</a> very weary of hearing the word regionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2138.733s">When</a> I hear the word regionalization, it makes me think <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2141.573s">county</a> government we all know how well that worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2144.518s">So</a> with that being said I will be opposed to this measure this evening, but I can certainly respect and appreciate where the council is coming from and why he's bringing this measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cxtnrZly_dE&t=2151.829s">This</a> is more about a philosophy on government than it is about anything else.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_cIJpB_Vzubc/2024-11-19_cIJpB_Vzubc.html">City Council 01-11-22</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=144.64s">Excellent,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=766.759s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=767.58s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=768.507s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=769.988s">Again,</a> I will reiterate my statement from last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=773.01s">This</a> matter presented itself when the Medford City Council at a meeting where it established its priorities for the term said that a priority for this council was to retain independent legal counsel for the Medford City Council, to get a lawyer for the council, an assistant city solicitor to represent the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=792.021s">Now,</a> I believe by statute, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=795.204s">the</a> city solicitor is required to represent both the council and the administration impartially. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=800.866s">When</a> KP Law was before us and Jonathan Silverstein was before us, he posed the question and the question was, if in fact you're retained by the city of Medford, who do you work for? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=815.19s">Do</a> you work for the Medford city council, the city of Medford or the city administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=818.991s">And</a> his answer was, I work for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=821.934s">So</a> here we are, the council asking for independent legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=826.157s">We</a> have a letter from the mayor, a communication from the mayor that says, it was agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=830.92s">It</a> was agreed that request for council attendance or advice will be submitted through the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=837.004s">It</a> wasn't agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=837.684s">The</a> council president at the time is sitting right here and he's saying it wasn't agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=841.653s">On</a> face value, this paper is untruthful, because it was not agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=847.538s">It</a> was not agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=848.738s">Now,</a> here we are, and this issue first came up, and it first came up in July, June, June. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=853.942s">It</a> first came up in June of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=857.105s">And</a> I find it curious that this paper never found its way to the council agenda, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=861.648s">Never</a> found its way to the council agenda until Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco were gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=869.046s">The</a> administration had plenty of time to bring this paper to the table and to negotiate with the then-council president terms that would be satisfactory to the council that set those priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=877.991s">And</a> instead what they did, shockingly, was sat on their hands for three months and waited for the weather to change, and then brought the paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=886.736s">And</a> I think that's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=888.336s">I</a> think it's shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=890.106s">So</a> here we are in no further or better of a position than we were back in June when we cut this item out of the budget because the council was not satisfied with the services that we were receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=904.137s">But</a> the paper's back on the table and we've not moved one inch closer to a positive resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=910.962s">Councilor</a> Collins makes a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=912.303s">She</a> says, there might be a disruption in services. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=916.684s">You're</a> gonna hear that a lot, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=918.845s">You're</a> gonna hear that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=919.825s">You</a> have to pass this tonight, or Rome's gonna burn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=922.605s">We</a> want it now, we need it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=924.166s">If</a> not, Medford's gonna fall apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=927.547s">It's</a> a sell, that's all it is, is a sell. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=929.547s">Medford's</a> not gonna fall apart if they don't have these contracted legal services in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=934.448s">This</a> is an increase to the budget, another increase to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=938.009s">Week</a> two of the new term, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=940.802s">Week</a> two, we've already seen this year's fiscal budget increased twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=945.603s">In</a> two weeks, two proposals to increase the fiscal year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=949.564s">$191</a> million, $191 million isn't enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=954.045s">More,</a> spend more with no plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=957.666s">Piecemeal,</a> week by week, let's come over here in dribs and drabs and see how much we can get out of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=963.408s">It's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=965.088s">It's</a> not right, it's not proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=966.929s">The</a> council voted to set a list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=968.75s">One</a> of the list of priorities was to be able to retain legal counsel to advise it in matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=974.353s">Because</a> we haven't received that advice in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=978.495s">And</a> we've seen what great progress we can make when we have the tools in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=982.978s">We've</a> seen what great progress we can make when we have Mike Wabrowski sitting there running meetings for us that take on the first comprehensive zoning reform that the city's seen in a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=993.31s">That's</a> not from the court of office. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=995.151s">That's</a> from the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=996.351s">That's</a> where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=997.331s">That's</a> where this work product coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=999.172s">Give</a> us the tools to succeed and we'll succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1001.933s">This</a> negotiation is not negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1005.114s">This</a> paper is untruthful on its face. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1007.494s">There</a> was never an agreement made. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1009.055s">There</a> was never an agreement brought back to this council and voted on by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1012.456s">The</a> council set a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1013.936s">They</a> said the priority was gonna be to have legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1016.077s">We</a> cut this item out of the budget because we didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1018.858s">There</a> was no negotiation, there was no settlement to the issue at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1022.341s">The</a> council is once again, get him pushed aside and get him bamboozled. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1026.344s">For</a> that reason, that reason alone, I will not be supporting this paper and I support Councilor Scott Cowie's motion to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1032.169s">If</a> in fact we're going to have a constructive dialogue, let's put everybody in the room together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1036.333s">Let's</a> talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1037.634s">All</a> right, the mayor thinks she has the keys to the car now because she has two new councilors over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1041.846s">that</a> don't have the institutional knowledge or the level of frustration that some of us share from the lack of responses that we receive from our office when we're trying to move the city forward together. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1052.052s">And</a> for those reasons, I will not be supporting this paper this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1243.559s">I'm</a> just wondering if when Chief of Staff Nazarian gives her presentation, she can give me an estimate as to when the requested draft ordinance that I put forward back in 2020 with KP Law would be forthcoming relative to establishing a $15 minimum wage for all city and school department employees while she's giving her presentation to the answer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1490.371s">It</a> was 21 months ago, maybe 20 months ago we made the request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1523.452s">If</a> I may, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1525.553s">I</a> find it very interesting that, you know, KP Law has been given such control of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1534.386s">model</a> that we're adopting really provides the city with lack of control direction and retention. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1540.468s">And</a> it also really puts us in a position where we're becoming overreliant on the outsourcing legal services here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1548.711s">You</a> know, we'll sit here and we'll talk about all the niche laws <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1551.675s">with</a> a niche law that we can have expertise on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1554.837s">I</a> mean, ultimately, we have people from the administration going to sick people's houses and checking up on them as part of a labor dispute, we have union busting going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1561.502s">All</a> right, we have labor charges being filed against the city left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1564.985s">Okay,</a> we're in with there's over 20 labor charges filed against the city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1568.909s">over</a> 20 labor charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1570.669s">So</a> I'm not too sure what type of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1574.931s">When</a> I hear that the chief of staff is going to sick people's houses on a Friday delivering them lettuce, I don't know what kind of advice we're getting, but it doesn't sound like good advice to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1825.991s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, as indicated in my lengthy soliloquy on the previous matter relative to my concerns relative to the spending in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1837.401s">I've</a> raised this issue in the past, and I put it on the agenda again. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1841.005s">Before</a> Anishal Natalie was moved on to greener pastures, she would appear before us quarterly <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1849.507s">and</a> provide us with a presentation on our fiscal health and wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1852.11s">And</a> part of that would include, Mr. President, discussion about our forecast of revenues versus our actual returns, where we are in the budget right now in the process of spending, what our debt service obligations are, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1867.704s">We</a> now have had this great influx of money coming in from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1872.349s">We</a> have ARPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1873.67s">We're</a> looking at what about $49 million I believe was the figure to be spent over the next three years we've already spent about a quarter of that with no federal funds manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1881.835s">So</a> my concerns really focused on being sure that we act as fiscal stewards, and that we are aware of what direction we're going and how much spending <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1891.36s">we're</a> committing to, and what position we're going to be putting ourselves into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1894.983s">And</a> I'd like to see our chief financial officer, as well as the necessary consultants that seem to be providing a great deal of services to this community, to be here as well, to answer the questions that we need to address, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1905.19s">But</a> this is something that we did last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1907.172s">It</a> was something that proved to be very successful, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1950.163s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, I don't think that the city council's ability to be updated and be filled in as to what's going on in this community should be subject to the personnel disasters that are going on across the hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1963.854s">I</a> don't care who the CFO is or auditor is, but that's the person that should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=1967.957s">And</a> if they don't have the answers for us, then that's going to be very indicating as to what direction this community is going in financially.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2034.565s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2035.847s">As</a> you're well aware, we pass a budget every year and that budget says we're gonna spend money on this and we're gonna spend money on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2041.952s">But</a> then we sit here and we say, how much money did we give KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2047.036s">The</a> Warren articles are what will tell us that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2048.577s">The</a> Warren articles are what we spend our bills on every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2050.998s">In</a> other forms of government, sometimes the Warren articles have to be approved by the city council on a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2055.479s">That's</a> not the case here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2057.6s">However,</a> the Warren articles are very telling as to what direction this community is going in, where our money is being spent, whether or not we're meeting the obligations, the goals that we've established through the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2067.104s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that this practice be reinstated. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2070.805s">Again,</a> this was an item that, <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2072.826s">And</a> Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin was providing us with previously before her departure from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2078.151s">And</a> it showed us quite a bit of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2080.893s">I</a> do believe when we reviewed this information last time, we found that there were a number of lawsuits that were settled that were over the sum of $2,500, which require council approval that were never brought before the council, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2091.943s">So</a> there's a lot of spending practices that are going on here that I think we need to take a closer look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2095.787s">And</a> the Warren articles will be very telling to us as to what direction <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2099.84s">our</a> communities going in and whether or not we're adopting the generally accepted accounting principles that are so recommended in municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2107.363s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2193.525s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2195.246s">Under</a> the Burke administration, the city of Medford a very successful senior work off program and the senior work off program provided senior citizens in this community with the opportunity to volunteer their services here for the city in exchange for an abatement on their property taxes up to I believe it was 1000 or $1500 per person. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2213.291s">This</a> program, I believe has been discontinued. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2216.622s">in</a> light of probably COVID and a number of other factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2220.306s">But</a> this is a benefit that with the adoption of a local option, we can extend to veterans here in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2226.031s">And</a> I think that that would be a good thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2227.653s">We</a> have a number of veterans in this community, over 2,000 veterans reside in the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2231.798s">And</a> I think if we can take the appropriate steps to adopt a provision like this and then request that the administration implement, I will be able to provide some property tax relief to a number of people that served our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2242.25s">So</a> I'm asking if the council support this measure and I'm hoping that we can move post haste to have a meeting with the solicitor and the assessor to determine what steps we need to take to appropriately implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2254.823s">Thank</a> you Councilor Knight, Councilor Stroud.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2308.81s">I</a> think if you read the text of it, because it's wicked long, I don't blame you for missing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2313.934s">The</a> solicitor and the assessor appear before the Council without lining up for upper steps.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2318.377s">Yeah,</a> in a regular session. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2319.478s">I</a> mean, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2320.239s">Either</a> way, it's fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2321.38s">I'd</a> like to do it in regular session. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2323.321s">If</a> there's no, doesn't sound like there's going to be much opposition to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2325.903s">If</a> there's no opposition to it, we can do it in regular session.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2392.88s">Nice</a> for the veterans to get the support in City Hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2467.733s">Well,</a> the paper before us would be the disposition of the paper would be asking them to appeal before us and give us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2472.996s">So</a> we dispose of the paper, send it to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2475.097s">We're</a> ready to come back to you with the answer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2607.518s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe that that area would be referred to as a sleepy hollow. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2613.36s">And</a> if it's my understanding, there is a maintenance agreement between the DCR and the city of Medford, where the city of Medford actually agrees to maintain and control the cleanliness of that area, if I'm not mistaken.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=2649.243s">Is</a> that when you say sleeping on the condon shell?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3251.973s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I too would like to amend this further, just by asking that the administration respond to the Council in writing and then post it on the city website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cIJpB_Vzubc&t=3261.5s">So</a> this information can be readily available to citizens in the community have concerns about their loved ones and such facilities.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9W26eEllQ8Y/2024-11-19_9W26eEllQ8Y.html">City Council 01-04-22</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=400.979s">On</a> a vote of six in favor and one and one abstention.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1425.745s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I see this nothing more as, you know, streamlining the way that we do business a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1435.128s">Ultimately,</a> I think it's safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1439.218s">The</a> President has always been given some flexibility and leeway in establishing subcommittees, whether or not they outlined in the rules or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1447.229s">So</a> I think what we're really doing is kind of splitting hairs a little bit over an issue here that's not really that big of a deal right ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1453.073s">We</a> have a number of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1454.454s">My</a> first term, when I was elected, Councilor Camuso and I went over the list, and I recommended that he create a number of different subcommittees, and he just created them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1464.44s">We</a> didn't have to go through rules change or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1466.981s">So</a> when I'm looking at this, I think, you know, we talk about some of the ad hoc committees that we've voted on to allow the president to have discretion to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1474.265s">You</a> know, I don't think this is anything that's outside the norm of the power vacuum that we've allowed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1479.268s">So</a> I certainly have no problem with it, Mr. President, ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1482.23s">You</a> know, we have a number of items on relative to the rules, the rules will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1486.779s">But</a> in terms of, you know, committees and committee structure and the standing committees, I don't think it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1492.04s">worth</a> getting into a hours long debate over it when historically, you know, the flexibility has been there for the President to take such action. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1499.926s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly wouldn't question the Council President's authority in appointing the subcommittees that are currently standing, the ones that we've, you know, we just transferred all the papers over that are in the standing committees now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1513.056s">So</a> those standing committees need to be chaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1514.937s">We</a> just voted on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1515.698s">That</a> was the second paper we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1517.159s">So</a> ultimately, at the very least, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1519.084s">the</a> council president should have the ability to, at the very least, chair those subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1523.366s">And</a> then if this is going to be an issue we can deal with in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1526.047s">But</a> in terms of allowing us the ability to continue conducting business, I don't think that this is something that you get in the way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1532.47s">So</a> I don't want this to be something saying, you know, we can't do anything anymore until we figure out who's going to be the chairman of the rules committee, the licensing committee, because we just took a vote to transfer all those papers that are in those committees over this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1544.076s">So</a> those committees right now are already standing committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1545.977s">We</a> took a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1547.197s">So</a> I think we're really kind of beating a dead horse.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1695.874s">of</a> the Committee of the Whole is going to be the establishment of what the new committees are going to be, then yeah, I don't have a problem having the Committee of the Whole in that, provided that the existing and standing committees still stand, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1706.957s">I'm</a> not in favor of that whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1708.577s">We</a> already verb that in standing array, so they're already in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1711.998s">If</a> the councilor has questions and wants to vet it, I don't have a problem providing that opportunity.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=1717.719s">I'd</a> certainly second the motion with the understanding that the other standing committees will still be filled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2374.198s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2374.999s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2376.459s">This</a> is something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2378.82s">Councilor</a> Bears has brought up two issues that are very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2382.482s">The</a> $15 minimum wage for city and school department employees and also a sick leave bank ordinance for city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2389.626s">These</a> are two items that I brought up two years ago, asking to draft ordinances from our city solicitor appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2398.142s">and</a> they must be very long pieces of municipal legislation, Mr. President, because it's been 24 long months, and this body's not received draft ordinances of either one of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2409.531s">So</a> here we are this evening, and we're gonna have a paper asking us to further fund legal services in the administration, to further fund the legal service line item, to expand the budget for this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2419.998s">This</a> is a perfect example, Mr. President, of why this council needs its own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2425.393s">This</a> is an item that should have been addressed long before, long before today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2429.876s">This</a> is an item that we could have handled through municipal ordinance that would have provided a sickly bank program for municipal employees and school department employees, just like they offer to state employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2438.5s">Merit</a> on the state legislation of which I printed out, drafted and submitted to the city solicitor's office when this ordinance proposal was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2448.546s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank the councilors for bringing this measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2452.465s">It's</a> something that will benefit a number of workers here in this community, and it's something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2456.948s">I</a> don't need a meeting with the solicitor or anybody else to know that this is something I'm going to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2460.671s">What</a> I need a meeting with the solicitor for is to make sure that when I vote for it, we vote for it the right way, so it's implemented properly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2788.03s">I've</a> personally known Michael for a number of years, probably the better part of 10 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2792.373s">His</a> wife's a business owner here in the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2794.475s">She</a> runs a law office right down in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2797.056s">And</a> Michael's looking for an opportunity to continue in his wife's footsteps and be a business owner in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2804.141s">We</a> all know GNP is a wonderful establishment here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2807.263s">It's</a> some of the best pizza that you can get in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2809.145s">And</a> I think this is gonna be a great opportunity for Mr. LaChapelle to partner up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2814.092s">with</a> one of our existing successful businesses and expand upon the successes that we've seen there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2818.894s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly have no problem by supporting this document, this paper that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2823.575s">Like</a> I said, I've known the gentleman for a number of years in a professional and personal capacity, and he's someone that I believe will bring a number of great assets to our community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2928.716s">Mr.</a> President, I'd be happy to give a brief synopsis if someone would like to waive the reading.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2939.933s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this is my biannual attempt to have a meeting night change from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2947.056s">Ultimately,</a> because we have an open meeting while it requires 48 hours of posting, the City Council is required to get its agenda items into the City Clerk by Friday, unless there's a holiday on that Monday, which would require us to get it in on a Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2958.95s">Now</a> we all know that the majority of events in this community in the majority of time that we are able to be free to interact with constituents occurs usually after the working hours on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2969.458s">So</a> the situation I find myself in a lot of times Mister president is that the agenda has been published on a Friday afternoon and I'm down to Matt 7 a cup of coffee and someone comes in asking me to help with some. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2978.802s">And</a> I don't have the ability to bring that item to the table and put it on the agenda, because the open meeting requires that we have to have the meeting notice posted within 48 hours, because of Saturday and Sunday, not being included in the counting of those 48 hours, we lose two and a half days to get items onto the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=2996.237s">So</a> this is nothing more than really, Mr. President, an attempt to allow us to do business a little bit quicker and to allow us the opportunity to put things on the agenda in a faster fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3005.779s">Also,</a> when you think about this building, right, Wednesday night is the night the City Hall is open late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3010.201s">So</a> instead of having City Hall being open on Tuesday nights just especially for the City Council meeting to meet this whole building for us to come in here to conduct our business, the building will already be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3020.183s">The</a> building will already be heated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3021.223s">There'll</a> be personnel that's in here already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3024.358s">department</a> heads they're already working late. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3026.54s">So</a> if we do need to talk to somebody we may have the ability to have them come right down and speak to us, Mr. President, we'll be able to get answers a little bit quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3032.924s">If</a> we have committees as a whole, existing staff will already be on hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3036.027s">So</a> department heads won't be dragged in there on Tuesday nights to deal with council business and then also be dragged in again on a Wednesday night so that, you know, we can take their life into consideration as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3044.253s">But</a> I think that this is really just an opportunity for us to allow us to represent our constituents better because it gives us the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3051.318s">to</a> get the freshest items that are in our head and put them on the agenda immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3054.719s">After</a> the weekend, we can put something on the agenda on a Monday, and it's gonna show up on the agenda for Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3059.541s">And</a> I think that that's just a little bit more efficient and effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3061.841s">So</a> that's why I bring this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3063.582s">And</a> with that being said, Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell have been so generous in their willingness to send items to the committee of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3072.085s">I</a> would be happy to make a motion to send this item there as well to be further discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3076.486s">I</a> have brought it to the table before it has failed before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3079.487s">I</a> would not like to see this fail again, so I'd be happy to deliberate and discuss with my council colleagues what they feel would be best direction for us to move.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3143.641s">You</a> know the mayor still would be bombed by our 10 day requirement to respond items that have passed by the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3148.904s">So</a> whether the meetings on the Tuesday or Wednesday the administration still about to act within the 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3153.667s">The</a> forecast right so if they use Wednesday's you know the employees and the staff is still required to work at 37.5 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3161.619s">whenever</a> it may be, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3162.62s">It's</a> just a time management issue at that point, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3165.202s">So</a> the night of the council meeting should have no bearing on whether or not members of the administration can conduct the job that they're being paid to do within 37.5 hours a week that they're being paid to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3176.333s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3236.882s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, I think it's important to point out that the Council meetings are a public meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3242.223s">And</a> this is the Council Chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3244.744s">And</a> when we talk about the successes of just this past week, for example, we just cut the ribbon on one of Councilor Caraviello's greatest accomplishments as a Councilor, the library, which has a beautiful new community space. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3254.706s">We</a> look across the parking lot, we do see the Senior Center, which has a beautiful room in there that we've been able to use in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3261.806s">Back</a> this way, we see the Shabbat auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3263.908s">We</a> get in the car and drive up the street, we see the little theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3266.149s">So</a> there are a number of spaces in this community that can host live gatherings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3270.112s">Again,</a> this is more of an efficiency standpoint for the council and the ability for us to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3273.875s">So</a> with that being said, I don't think we need to beat the host to death, but there are some valid arguments for and against Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3369.845s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3371.126s">Michael</a> was a mentor and a dear friend to me for a number of years, and I wouldn't be sitting here this evening if it weren't for the guidance that he gave me as a young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3378.849s">He's</a> someone that dedicated his life to public service, a Vietnam veteran, a governor's Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3384.966s">48-year</a> state employee, commissioner of racing, chairman of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, founder of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, and most notably, Mr. President, famous in Medford folklore for saving Wrights Pond from being developed into condominiums in the late 70s and early 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3403.66s">And</a> if you go up to Wrights Pond to this day, you'll see a memorial there in Michael's honor, recognizing the work that he did in protecting one of Medford's most beautiful natural resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3414.007s">Michael</a> was someone that served this community, this country, and this commonwealth with dedication and passion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3419.691s">He's</a> someone that would be the life of the party if he walked in the door, you'd know he was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3423.814s">He</a> was someone that wore his hat and his sleeve and would give you the shirt off his back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3426.876s">And</a> he's someone that's certainly greatly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3429.438s">He's</a> someone that made a big impact in my life and someone who I think of often. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3433.68s">And</a> annually on this day, I bring this metaphor to Juan and my friend Michael, and I ask my council colleagues to join me in doing the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3567.937s">I</a> think this is a rather self explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3570.558s">We</a> do have a problem in this community with gap with gas leaks, you look at these figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3575.42s">These</a> aren't figures that I made up the figures that I got right from the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3580.221s">The</a> research shows that there are typically 1.5 to 3 times more leaks than reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3584.904s">It's</a> not something I made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3585.945s">It's</a> something that I got right off the website of the Department of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3589.287s">So</a> we're seeing a situation here in this community where we have a problem and we need to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3594.49s">We're</a> seeing a lot of digging being done by our public utilities and we're not holding them accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3599.353s">We're</a> not bringing our public utilities back to the table to be sure that they resurface our roadways in a condition that's suitable to the taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3607.218s">It's</a> something that needs to be addressed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3609.54s">So</a> between the environmental issues that we have with the gas leaks, the safety issues that we have with the gas leaks, and the quality of life issues that we have with the condition of our roadways, I think that this is something that should be a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3620.106s">So</a> I'm asking that the administration come up with a plan on how to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3622.927s">And</a> I'd like to further amend the paper and ask that this be based on the reports due section of the council agenda for 90 days, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3965.451s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much again this is a paper that we put on annually requesting that the administration provide us with an update as to what the organizational structure is week after week we're seeing new jobs being proposed to this council new positions being proposed positions being upgraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3980.417s">It's</a> my hope that we can get an organizational chart to show us exactly who's doing what, when, and where. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3985.679s">Just</a> last week, I believe we had about $800,000 worth of new positions before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=3989.98s">So</a> I think it's important for us to understand the financial impact of what's going on with the new positions that are being created in this community, both to the tax dollar and also to our grant funds that are coming from the feds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4000.624s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would ask that this <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4003.479s">Council</a> resolutions be answered in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4005.421s">I</a> do think it's important that our council resolutions be answered in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4008.344s">It's</a> great to have a representative from the administration here, but that does not make for my file. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4013.042s">And</a> when it comes time for me to pull this out and look at it again later on, it doesn't do me any good. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4016.825s">It</a> doesn't do me any help. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4018.346s">It's</a> really an issue for me to understand who does what, where our money is being spent, and why it's being spent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4024.331s">And</a> it also allows us as councillors to know who to pick up the phone and call when we need something to get done so that we don't have to bring it to the council floor and to have constituent work be debated on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4033.759s">So</a> I think this is an important step moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4035.96s">If</a> we look at our fiscal year's budget, we'll see an organizational chart <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4040.024s">But</a> we've seen a number of new positions that have been created. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4042.007s">We've</a> seen a number of people take on transitionary roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4044.712s">And</a> right now, those transitionary roles, some people are in 2 hats, some people are in 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4049.479s">So,</a> I just want to know where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4052.898s">Ultimately,</a> we have a number of positions that were funded in the budget that aren't filled right now, so we're gonna have some surplus funds that may require end of the year transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4061.104s">It's</a> really a financial issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4063.126s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4066.509s">The</a> more we understand about the organizational structure, where the money's being spent, the better job that we can do for the people that we represent.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4391.11s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4393.551s">In</a> 2019, I put forward a resolution asking that we do just this, that we expand our cooperative education opportunities in the vocational school to include some of the trades that fall within the public works sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4405.196s">Ultimately,</a> we have an aging infrastructure and an aging workforce here in the city of Medford, and it would be nice for us to be able to cultivate some homegrown talent to bring them into our public works sphere and our public works sector so that we can continue to fill positions that become vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4421.183s">During</a> the Burke administration, I had the opportunity to meet with Chad Fallon, the director of the vocational school, and we had some preliminary discussions about this type of thing and expanding programming over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4432.53s">We</a> also met with representatives from the Laborers Program and representatives from the Teamsters Union, who represent the DPW here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4442.116s">And</a> the discussions were great, and the project was looking like it was coming around. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4446.559s">And</a> then, you know, the RONA happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4449.155s">school</a> got shut down and the expansion of opportunities for children wasn't really on the forefront of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4454.279s">The</a> agenda was making sure that we could educate our children safely, not expand opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4461.344s">And</a> this issue kind of fell by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4463.185s">And</a> I'd like to make this issue a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4466.468s">It's</a> fitting that in January of 2020, they found that this is a absolute priority, the best practice from the Massachusetts Municipal Association, a group that this community is a member of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4477.355s">So</a> I think that this is something that we need to look at, Mr. President, and I might ask that we send it to the school administration and ask them to report back to us within 90 days as to what their findings are and whether or not this is something we can continue to pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4488.941s">It's</a> something I think that would require some upfront funding, something that I think would be a worthwhile investment here in this community because we're going to be investing in the education of residents in the city who in turn may someday actually become the Director of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4502.048s">may</a> actually in turn become the director of uh the superintendent of water um you know individuals that live in the community have a vested interest in the community um i've always been a firm believer in uh in having a department that's beef city residents um you know i don't think it's fair that they get in their car and drive away to where they live and i go to the supermarket and get yelled at for the job but they're not being held accountable i've always said that uh you know i've thought that um department that should be residents in other communities you'll see that as a requirement i'm not saying that's a proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4527.881s">or</a> anything, but I'm saying if we can take this opportunity to utilize our vocational school to educate students in the public works field and put them to work here in our community, we'll have people that live in this community that have a vested interest in the success of this community, not just the paycheck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4541.974s">And</a> I'm not saying that that's the situation our department has, but you have seen that in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4546.678s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4885.953s">I</a> just want to say, I share Councilor cables concern and frustration, as the chairman of the ordinance committee that worked long and hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4894.681s">I</a> think that this has gone inordinately too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4898.024s">This</a> issue should have been addressed long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4900.185s">These</a> licenses should have been, you know, vetted in the host community agreement should have been negotiated we're leaving a ton of money on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4908.272s">I</a> don't want to hear in eight months that we don't have the money for something that we're looking for when we could have been collected $3.3 billion a year from the licensees of marijuana dispensaries here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4919.457s">You</a> know, the voters voted to have marijuana dispensaries here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4924.799s">The</a> voters have spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4925.74s">It</a> should be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4927.34s">And,</a> you know, for this council to take the steps to properly <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4931.486s">that</a> the ordinance put the ordinance in place and then properly adopt the local option tax benefits for this community, so that we can see fiscal gain and still not see those fruits of our labor is frustrating, Mr. President, so I might do share the council's concern I look forward to seeing a license be issued in the near future, hopefully.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4981.723s">I</a> do believe it's important to point out that the ordinance did say that the Cannabis Advisory Commission would convene within 45 days of passage and begin the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=4989.344s">And</a> I don't think that they ended up falling into the compliance windows with the ordinance when it was passed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5927.385s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5929.447s">Again,</a> this is a perfect example why contracting out city law services is not in the best interest of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5936.892s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5937.713s">The</a> administration needs to own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5939.695s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5941.076s">Ultimately,</a> when entered into an agreement, and the agreement had a non compete clause in it that said that they would not open up an entertainment venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5950.923s">We</a> signed this agreement as a city, Bill Blumenreich did not sign it, the city of Medford signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5958.026s">Because</a> we signed this mitigation agreement, that led to the city of Medford putting out an RFP for the operations of Chevalier Auditorium, because there was a non-compete in it, which led to us investing money into the auditorium, because we had a non-compete. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5970.093s">The</a> operator operates that auditorium on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5973.195s">He</a> doesn't own it, he operates it on behalf of the city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5976.837s">So</a> if the agreement's been violated, or if the terms of the agreements are being stretched, it should be owned by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5985.633s">because</a> the administration's the one that signed the mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5988.676s">Bill</a> Blumenreich did not sign that mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5991.478s">The</a> city of Medford signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5992.819s">So</a> the city of Medford should own this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5994.78s">All</a> right, we shouldn't say, oh, sorry, Bill, you're on your own. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=5997.463s">And</a> we certainly shouldn't say, here's 2,500 bucks, because that's not going to get you very far. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6002.567s">All</a> right, you're going against Wynn Casino, where's 2,500 bucks going to get you? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6005.93s">They'll</a> give you a free toaster after you go down there and put it in the slot machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6008.512s">On</a> Sunday, they'll call you down, have you stand in line and give you a free price. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6011.134s">I</a> mean, that's not going to get us very far, 2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6012.455s">5,000</a> isn't going to get us very far. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6015.502s">All</a> right, so I can understand the need and the desire to partner with somebody that has deep pockets in Mr. Blumenreich. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6020.967s">And</a> I understand that he has a vested interest in what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6024.19s">But</a> I think we need to take a step back and look at this from a little bit of a different perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6029.168s">But</a> for the mitigation agreement, we never would have put out the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6033.272s">And</a> if we never put out the RFP, then Blumenreich never would have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6036.755s">And</a> then he never would have been in the situation he's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6038.776s">So</a> I think that we really need to take a bigger role and a bigger responsibility in this than just a joint partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6043.46s">You</a> know, this is something that we've been championing as elected officials as politicians as people behind this rail we've been championing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6050.146s">Shavia</a> is everyone's greatest success story. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6052.468s">Everyone's</a> everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6053.549s">I</a> built it on my back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6054.65s">He</a> built it on his back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6055.65s">You</a> brought the air conditioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6056.711s">You</a> brought the chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6057.492s">I</a> mean, every time anybody gets a chance to talk about Shavia, we're over here, we're giving ourselves the biggest pat on the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6062.996s">Let's</a> own the issue because now's the time to put our money where our mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6066.778s">Now's</a> the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6067.519s">That's</a> going to be the catalyst for our downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6069.781s">We</a> shouldn't be pattering up with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6071.282s">We</a> should be taking the bull by the horns and we should be driving the truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6073.984s">And</a> I think that we're seeing a lot of that because we're subcontracting on services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6080.347s">We</a> don't have that institutional knowledge anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6082.008s">We're</a> gonna end up moving backwards, not forwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6088.533s">The</a> biggest and greatest success story of Medford Square in the past 15 years has been Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6092.916s">We</a> can't let this slip through our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6095.037s">And</a> a payment of $5,000 or a partnership with the operator, I don't think is gonna cut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6100.012s">I</a> think we need to get our state delegation involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6102.994s">I</a> also think we need to approach this regionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6104.696s">I</a> think Councilor Caraviello made up some great, great suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6108.599s">I</a> mean, the gaming commission has to be on board with this and we have to address it regionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6112.082s">There's</a> only a number of communities that are eligible to receive funds through the mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6115.985s">We</a> happen to be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6116.886s">We</a> happen to be very fortunate to be one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6118.747s">We</a> should be capitalizing on that and we should be doing it today, not tomorrow, not later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6122.69s">And</a> certainly not in partnership and certainly not in second seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6127.681s">because</a> this city signed the agreement, nobody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6130.062s">So</a> let's own the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6131.863s">I</a> look forward to talking about this issue further. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6133.724s">I</a> think that this is something that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6135.845s">I</a> appreciate Victor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6137.025s">I</a> know that Victor's been on top of a lot of the things that are happening in this community when it comes to economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6141.668s">This</a> is a very big concern for me, a very big concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6145.57s">If</a> Chevalier fails, the square fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6150.082s">And</a> quite frankly, it's only hanging on by a thread right now we haven't seen too much going on down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6155.365s">The</a> mayor announced a big plan at her State of the Union inauguration the other day about putting out an RFI for what we can do to this downtown to redevelop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6165.269s">The</a> linchpin of the redevelopment of this downtown is that auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6169.031s">And</a> we need to do all that we can and invest whatever resources we have and pursue whatever funding possibilities are available to us to make sure that it remains successful. <a

forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6180.44s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=6181.842s">President</a> Morell.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7591.943s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7593.164s">Yes,</a> I echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7596.607s">I</a> had the opportunity to meet Nina over the years, and she was a wonderful person, a joy to be around, and she always lit up the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7602.471s">You</a> wouldn't know it, but she had quite the sense of humor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7605.493s">My</a> condolences to Stephen and Stephanie, and Brian, Ryan, and Brie. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7609.055s">It's</a> a tough time, and just know that we're thinking of you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7784.321s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I echo, again, Councilor Caraviello's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7788.644s">I,</a> too, had the pleasure of meeting Barbara on a number of occasions throughout my tenure in service, and she was a great person, someone who certainly put her community first, someone who gave a lot to the City of Metroton and the City of Somerville as the matriarch of the Sloan family in Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7807.519s">If</a> you look at <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7809.287s">and</a> the beautiful job that they did out in front of Century Bank, the old Century Bank location used to be Papageno's. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7816.47s">You'll</a> see that that's dedicated to her and it's just a beautiful testament to that person that she was and what was important to her community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7823.092s">So</a> with that being said, my condolences also go out to the Sloan family during that time of need.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7866.406s">Mr.</a> President, yes I'd like to take an opportunity to extend my condolences and ask my council colleagues to do the same to the family of Eugene McKinney. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7874.611s">Many</a> of us behind this rail have been involved in the challenge of baseball tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7878.877s">And</a> that was the product of the McKinney-Falasca family. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7882.239s">The</a> McKinneys and the Falascas have done a great job in this community, dedicating themselves, helping run the Challenger League for the last 25 years, raising countless funds for the Challenger League, and making sure that it was able to continue for the better part of 30 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=7898.89s">So</a> with that being said, they recently lost their father, and I'd like to extend this offer of condolences to the family during that time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8316.575s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8318.076s">This</a> started out as a council priority for the council to receive independent legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8328.464s">And</a> that proposal and priority arose from <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8332.622s">the</a> fact that there were an inordinate number of requests for opinions, the draft pieces of legislation this council makes that we don't receive, for whatever reason, that may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8345.607s">When</a> the budget was debated, a motion was made to reduce the contracted legal services line item by about 50,000 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8358.952s">And</a> the reason that that motion was made <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8361.313s">was</a> because of a dissatisfaction with the level of service that we were being provided as a governmental body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8369.959s">And</a> as part of that discussion, Councilor Caraviello was authorized to go negotiate with the mayor in terms of an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8379.065s">Now,</a> the council wanted its own lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8381.967s">The</a> council wanted its own person that they could go to, an assistant city solicitor to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8387.391s">And</a> that was taken off the table immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8389.844s">And</a> what the council got was the ability to get permission from the city solicitor to talk to a third party vendor for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8399.489s">And</a> that's not what we were asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8401.25s">That's</a> not what we were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8402.671s">And</a> that's not something I'm going to support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8405.172s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8406.172s">Um,</a> the narrative is false. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8408.554s">It's</a> a false narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8409.894s">You</a> know, um, sometimes the press release sounds a lot better than the real story. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8414.597s">And</a> the real story is the council has been begging for legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8417.847s">Since</a> we've gotten that one time we've gotten legal counsel that's been my proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8422.21s">We've</a> moved this community 15 years forward in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8426.494s">Since</a> we've gotten our own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8428.655s">This</a> is an issue I'm not willing to budge on Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8431.377s">We</a> haven't been able to negotiate terms of an agreement that were agreeable to the previous council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8436.061s">So</a> what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8437.482s">The</a> first meeting with a new council, the appropriation paper comes on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8442.147s">and</a> two Councilors that don't have the institutional knowledge of the background of this issue that happened are gonna be put on the spot to take a vote for a $50,000 appropriation on their first day of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8451.554s">That's</a> not right, that's not fair, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8454.576s">Number</a> two, we still haven't addressed the overall issue that this council has relative to its ability to retain and attain efficient, effective, and immediate legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8468.186s">So</a> with that being said, this is a paper I cannot support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8471.892s">We're</a> seeing paper after paper come before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8474.954s">Let's</a> look at the ad to $190 million budget, the largest budget in the city's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8480.299s">And</a> every week we're getting hit with papers saying, give us more, give us more, give us more. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8487.164s">Where's</a> the financial plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8489.526s">What's</a> going on in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8492.188s">We</a> can't just spend, spend, spend because that sounds like a good idea and see what sticks to the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8496.812s">That's</a> not how you run government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8497.873s">That's</a> not how you run government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8501.243s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this is an item that I cannot support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8505.445s">I</a> thank Councilor Capiello for giving it a great effort, but the negotiations moved nowhere in terms of what the administration offered at the beginning, what the council wanted, and where we ended up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8519.454s">There</a> was no moving of the needle. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8522.395s">This</a> is what I'm gonna give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8523.356s">Take</a> it or leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8525.017s">Leave</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8525.477s">I'm</a> gonna put out the press release saying that this is what I did, even though it's not what I did, and you guys can go and try to explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8533.117s">Right,</a> and they have two new freshman Councilors that are here that are gonna have to go out there and explain how come you don't want the city to have a lawyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8540.447s">How</a> come you don't want, how come you don't want to spend $50,000 for the city to have legal counsel and you're just talking about the supplier auditorium and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8547.809s">We're</a> going to give the Shavaya auditorium 2500 bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8550.87s">We're</a> going to come here and increase the budget by $50,000 to pay KP law, a third party vendor can't represent us in this in this big issue that we're just talking about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8559.053s">This</a> doesn't make sense to me Mr. President, this doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8562.914s">That's</a> where I stand on the issue I certainly would love to hear what my council colleagues have to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8568.776s">But</a> I'm telling you, I don't see this item coming up for a vote tonight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8642.655s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8642.975s">Point</a> of information just on when we speak about the downscaling of government, one of those things, you know, coming from the labor movement, one of those big things that we're very concerned about in the downscaling government is the privatization of services and the lack of institutional knowledge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8655.103s">So</a> when we're talking about the downsizing of government, the downscaling of government, we're talking about the race to the bottom, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8659.906s">It's</a> the race to the bottom, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8661.006s">We're</a> going to take this job that someone was getting a good pay, a good health benefit, and a good pension benefit, and we're going to take it out of government's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8668.531s">We're</a> going to subcontract it to somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8670.132s">We're</a> going to pay them less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8671.759s">give</a> them less benefits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8673.94s">And</a> not give them a solid retirement opportunities, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8677.081s">But</a> we're gonna be able to reap the rewards of that business decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8681.423s">That's</a> not equitable, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8683.683s">Like</a> you're saying, it's a race to the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8685.584s">It's</a> a race to the bottom.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8817.008s">we</a> had Jonathan Silverman from KP law here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8821.91s">And</a> he was posed the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8826.012s">We</a> do not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8826.653s">Do</a> you work for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8827.533s">No,</a> we do not work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8828.513s">We</a> work for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8830.794s">We</a> don't work for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8831.555s">We</a> work for the mayor that came right out of his mouth on that TV screen and on that TV screen, right in these chambers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8928.355s">So</a> on that point, Mr. President, when you think about all the things that KP law touched during the past term, 5g nightmare, marijuana nightmare, the only thing we got done was the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8941.037s">clothing</a> collection bins, I think, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=8945.321s">At</a> the end of the day, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9007.572s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Tseng, is that support stuff you refer to the city solicitor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9517.242s">If</a> chief of staff would like to present the paper or if there's a council night, let's have a question on them and be, I think the paper was before us for the last 90 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9538.17s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9668.703s">The</a> Finance Director Auditor position was upgraded relatively recently, was it not? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9676.229s">Under</a> the previous administration, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9680.132s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9684.515s">Chief</a> of Staff doesn't have that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9688.663s">My</a> recommendation would be to hold off until we get this classification study complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9692.425s">It</a> seems like every week we get the new position that we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade, we wanna upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9696.807s">We</a> don't have the ability to look at the total picture right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9699.208s">We're</a> not looking at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9700.788s">We're</a> handling things in a piecemeal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9703.429s">I</a> don't think it's gonna work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9704.45s">I</a> don't think it's fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9707.371s">So</a> tonight we had a paper before us that asked to increase the city's budget by 50,000 or so dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9714.182s">We</a> also have a paper before us that's asking to increase the salary, which is going to have a budgetary impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9719.186s">A</a> couple weeks ago, we got another paper that was upgrading another position. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9723.869s">So</a> we're seeing these job classifications that people are sitting in being upgraded, people getting raises in the salaries are causing the budget to go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9737.135s">At</a> some point, we need to take a look at what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9739.796s">Our</a> budget right now is already over 80% salary in benefits, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9744.599s">So</a> let's look at our spending a little bit before we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9748.34s">If</a> we have a grant for a classification study, and one of the most important positions that we have in the community would be the chief financial officer and auditor, I think we should probably let the study take place so that the experts can tell us exactly where that position needs to fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9764.848s">The</a> reason I say that is because <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9767.399s">If</a> we keep doing what we're doing, they're not going to have anything to study because we're going through every single position that we have here and we're creating caps and classifications for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9777.146s">And</a> I feel as though, you know, we're kind of putting the cat before the horse. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9781.029s">We're</a> talking about a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9782.75s">We're</a> talking about having the call and set to come in and do a classification study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9787.633s">Let</a> them do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9789.335s">Let's</a> not move people to where we think they should be and then have them come in and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9792.537s">Let's</a> get our back for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9794.238s">Let's</a> let the grant work these issues out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9797.912s">because</a> I'd be much more inclined to support a comprehensive review that has a report attached to it saying this is where our deficiencies are, this is where we can do better than coming at a piecemeal week by week and saying this is the position we want this week, this is the position next week we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9814.478s">I</a> understand the administration said that they're going to be bringing positions forward and that they're also going to be doing the classification study. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9820.361s">I</a> don't think that's the right way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9821.861s">That's</a> just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9822.902s">I</a> think if we have the grant to do a classification study, let's utilize the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9826.504s">That's</a> what it's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9827.124s">Let's</a> let these experts in the field come back and give us a work product so that we can make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=9832.366s">That's</a> where I'm coming from on this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10709.449s">With</a> all due respect, Mr. President, I don't think that $5,000 a year is gonna make us go from getting nobody to get Warren Buffett to walk through the door and start managing the city of Medford's finances, first of all, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10721.394s">I</a> think that the issue might not be the salary, it might be the culture in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10726.416s">It's</a> a very small, small group of people that perform municipal management, municipal financial management. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10732.918s">They're</a> a very small network of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10734.719s">Maybe</a> that's one of the reasons why we can't get applicants to want to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10740.451s">When</a> you look at these positions, you look at this human resources director's position, the incumbent in the position in a 12-month period got a 61% pay raise without council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10753.598s">61%</a> pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10755.219s">I</a> don't know anybody in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10762.323s">Anybody</a> in the world that gets a 61% pay raise in a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10767.887s">I</a> know that certainly flies in the face of a lot of the issues that have been raised by some of my colleagues when it comes to being able to have a living wage, having people pay their fair way, equity, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10783.517s">A</a> 61% salary increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10786.844s">is</a> something I've never heard of in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10788.605s">I</a> represented union employees across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and negotiated countless collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10795.991s">I've</a> never seen a 61% pay increase in a 12-month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10804.038s">The</a> spending plan needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10805.819s">The</a> classification study needs to be performed before we start spending taxpayer dollars without a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10811.503s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=10813.185s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11190.761s">I</a> thought that we tabled the positions that weren't filled so that we could have a committee of the whole of them to discuss the entire spending plan if I'm not mistaken, but it could be crazy, but that was in the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11224.419s">Chair</a> is that the matters were not tabled for any particular reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11226.66s">They</a> were just tabled so that we wouldn't have to vote on them last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11229.261s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11230.402s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11231.603s">Sounds</a> like efficient government to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11232.923s">They</a> must've been waiting to get rid of a couple of guys.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11312.984s">So</a> tonight, I'm trying to I'm just wrecking my brain tournament so this was the one way like we had the $, new jobs that were being created right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11320.993s">Yes,</a> and then we have the, we have like 49 million in our for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11325.558s">We</a> spent 8.5 to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11328.041s">Then</a> we got these new, these $800,000 worth of jobs that came before us to be filled that are outside the budget that we're going to use APA money to fund, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11337.848s">I</a> believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11338.208s">And</a> then we're going to try to fund these positions, I think, for the next four years, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11341.31s">Or</a> three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11342.19s">Three</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11342.971s">That's</a> like another $2.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11344.972s">So</a> we had like $49 million of APA money and we spent $8.5 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11349.133s">And</a> then this is another 2.4 that we're going to spend on that Apple money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11358.728s">We've</a> spent like 25% of our Apple money already. <a href="https://youtu.be/9W26eEllQ8Y&t=11361.773s">It</a> looks like I'd go more with 20.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE/2024-11-19_kp64eg_WEKE.html">City Council 12-21-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1160.051s">The</a> only concern I have is which positions are presently filled, which positions are filled and will be expiring for kids, after the Kids Act funding expires, which positions will go unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1173.037s">For</a> example, is amendment not funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=1174.718s">Is</a> that a concern?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4148.696s">Mr.</a> President, Vice President Knight, this project's been something that's been going on for what seems like now three administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4155.983s">We've</a> seen some progress be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4157.905s">Is</a> there any indication as to how far along we are, what phase we're in, in terms of seeing this <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4163.562s">Trail</a> comes to reality, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4165.923s">Number</a> two, I know we've expended some money for remediation in the area due to some soil contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4171.886s">And</a> there was also been some concerns relative to the abutters that needed to be addressed as the planning stages were going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=4178.929s">So</a> I'm wondering if the director of that office with way too many words can tell us exactly what's going on with this project and where we stand.

<a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7560.654s">Um,</a> so Mike, it's just, it's been a great, great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7563.154s">I</a> could go on and on and on and not pat you on the back, but, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7565.735s">I</a> think you know what you've accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7567.157s">I've</a> always been someone that's been putting results before the rhetoric and someone who's always been able to walk the walk and hold his head proud because he's been able to look at the mirror every morning and nobody's believed is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7578.108s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7579.669s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kp64eg_WEKE&t=7580.07s">Congratulations.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU/2024-11-19_LV3E3edqaKU.html">City Council 12-14-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=759.243s">Hey,</a> Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=760.963s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=762.043s">And</a> Ellen, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=763.504s">You</a> always do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=765.304s">So</a> in reading the packet here, and I apologize for not being able to make the meeting earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=770.968s">The</a> breakeven point looks like it's 705,000 give or take so that would be the assessed value of your home at 705,000 would be the breaking point, the breakeven point, which means that if your home was assessed over that amount that you, even though you would be an owner occupied policy wouldn't be eligible to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=789.118s">the</a> exemption, because when you receive the exemption but the shift would still come back to you so you'd actually see an increase in your tax bill if your property was assessed over that figure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=799.869s">And</a> then based upon your assessments here it looks like there would be about almost 14,000 eligible parcels.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=811.228s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=811.649s">And</a> it almost looks like half of those would be above the break even point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=817.235s">And</a> then of that 50% almost a third of that would be <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=824.73s">senior</a> citizen population.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=887.51s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=887.911s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LV3E3edqaKU&t=888.171s">I</a> appreciate it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_rk0Z0EFoxP4/2024-11-19_rk0Z0EFoxP4.html">City Council 12-07-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=158.924s">Vice</a> president night. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=159.964s">Mister</a> president, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=161.065s">I</a> think the sponsor this resolution for bringing the matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=164.125s">I</a> do believe this is something that this council discussed a couple years back when the casino first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=169.287s">As</a> part of mass thoughts plans with the opening of the casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=172.668s">I</a> believe that they took out of the street and they made the left hand lane going towards the middle of all left him turn only. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=182.942s">And</a> that's what's created a bunch of congestion in the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=186.823s">And</a> I second Councilor Falco's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=189.223s">I</a> think this is something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=190.664s">It's</a> been going on for far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=192.204s">And</a> the left-hand turn only lane has created quite a bit of disruption in the neighborhood, and it's something that needs to be addressed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=777.853s">Mister</a> president Mister president I will say this it's not uncommon for this council to have granted the administration the authority to enter into a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=785.477s">Outside</a> of the maximum 36 month as outlined in state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=789.859s">We</a> did it previously when we implemented the parking program and I certainly don't see any reason why we should do it now I certainly would support this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=798.984s">Some</a> are all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=2709.075s">And</a> so, Vice President night traffic policies established the traffic commission not the administration so the traffic policies already been established.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3141.07s">Thank</a> you very much Mister president. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3142.651s">You</a> know the way look at that that this whole situation is this ultimately. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3147.952s">I</a> think everybody by in this real wants parking enforcement in this community we've all called for it at one point or another saying we need parking enforcement in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3155.775s">8</a> years ago when there was no contract we all called for parking enforcement we said we want a parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3161.4s">I</a> think we all continue to want parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3168.09s">I</a> think we all agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3172.7s">Oh,</a> you can, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3173.861s">I</a> don't want to poison anybody to death over here with all these new rules they're making up. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3178.183s">I</a> think we can all agree that we need vehicles to conduct the parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3183.766s">I</a> think we can all agree that we also need financial data management systems to conduct parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3189.33s">So</a> the real question before us is whether or not, if we're gonna conduct parking enforcement, whether or not we're gonna allow a contract to be three years or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3199.22s">If</a> we're doing parking enforcement for one year, two years, three years, or five years, we're still going to need these mechanisms in place to conduct this performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3207.012s">We're</a> still going to need <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3208.228s">vehicles</a> to do it, we're still going to need data management systems to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3211.771s">So</a> if that's the case, and we can get more bang for our buck in a five-year contract, I think that that's something we should support. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3217.435s">You</a> know, when it comes down to the rollout of the plan and how the plan's supposed to work, I mean, that's a function of the administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3225.742s">That's</a> the executive branch's duty and job, to roll out the plan appropriately with the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3230.485s">And</a> the state legislature and the state law calls for us to take a vote to authorize the administration as to whether or not we should allow them to enter on a contract that exceeds three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3239.434s">That's</a> really the only issue that's before us today, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3243.122s">Do</a> we want parking enforcement for the next 3 years and look at extending a contract again at that point in time, or do we want to see if we can get more bang for our buck for a parking enforcement contract that lasts 5 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3254.332s">That's</a> the way that I'm looking at this, and I think that ultimately I want parking enforcement for the next 50 years, and if we can enter into a contract that saves the city money, then I think that's something we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3265.321s">So</a> I support the paper this evening, and I move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3785.424s">I</a> just think it's also important to look at this from the other side of the glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3789.93s">And</a> why are we assuming this is going to be a failure? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3795.436s">You</a> know, why are we assuming that us taking this in-house, which is what we cried for, is not going to work? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3802.064s">And</a> if we're going to share in the failures, then I'm assuming we'd also share in the successes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3805.807s">It's</a> our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3806.647s">That's</a> what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3807.928s">You</a> know, we had to, we had to improve the lives of the residents in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3811.371s">And,</a> you know, one of the things that we talked about was taking parking in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3815.534s">And</a> if we're going to take parking in house, there are certain steps of protocols that we need to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3819.776s">This</a> is one of them that's been recommended by someone who's worked in the industry who explains that this is industry standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3824.66s">That's</a> something that someone I've worked with in government 20 years ago, when I remember fondly, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3829.683s">You</a> know, I don't think that this is a situation where we're walking into the rollout of the first parking management plan that the city of Medford has ever seen in the middle of the winter, seven years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3842.329s">You</a> know, we've come a long way since that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3845.13s">Our</a> residents in this community have become accustomed to certain aspects of parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3851.553s">I</a> wanna see them continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3852.634s">I</a> know you do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3853.394s">You've</a> been the strongest advocate in this council for parking enforcement for the past 15 years, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3858.053s">I'm</a> not trying to take anything away from you from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3860.074s">I</a> just think in looking at this and us moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3863.336s">This</a> is could be a very successful program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3865.637s">This</a> could be a very successful program. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3867.358s">So</a> let's put the tools in the toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3868.639s">Let's</a> give them the tools that they need to build the foundation to make it be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3872.881s">Because</a> I feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3874.881s">If</a> we look at this from the glass being half full, it's something that we can also share in all the successes that come with it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3882.083s">I'm</a> not nervous about this program failing and people blaming me for it because, again, the scope of the vote before us as to whether or not you want to allow the mayor to enter into a contract that's three years or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3892.887s">I</a> don't think the 24 months makes a big difference when we have a cable contract that goes for 10, we have a trash contract that goes for 10, and we had a previous contract with parking administration that went for seven plus three. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3902.55s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3903.83s">And</a> I can understand you're passionate about the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3905.43s">And</a> quite frankly, if I'm more educated on it than me, and if I'm more invested in this parking issue than me, you served on the first parking commission, you made recommendations, you worked with this commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3913.332s">So</a> I understand where you're coming from, I really do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=3917.253s">That's</a> a wicked long point of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5724.526s">I</a> mean, I think that's a budgetary issue, not an issue for the CAF, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5730.85s">Amendment</a> B. Well, I have a question on the differential, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5734.452s">So</a> is that differential included in the 52,356.20 max, or is that in addition to?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5776.914s">And</a> so, to be clear, through the acting chief of staff, with the approval of M&A, the ordinance, which also showed that the 10% differential for employees after 6.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5785.601s">would</a> be included in the ordinance, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5798.252s">Yeah,</a> I mean, it's a non-union employee, so they're not represented by a collective bargaining agreement or contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5802.435s">So</a> this would be a fringe benefit to their employment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5805.917s">So</a> it's something that I believe should be included in the ordinance if it's passed this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5915.757s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly don't have a problem creating the positions, but we're gonna have a serious, significant discussion, I think, when it comes time asking for money to fund them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5926.28s">I</a> mean, we're looking at a department that was funded at $350,000 as a placeholder, as Councilor Marks noted, $250,000 in salaries, $100,000 in expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5938.397s">Based</a> upon what I'm hearing this evening, we're gonna have about 12 employees in this department, which is nine more than we budgeted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5944.739s">There's</a> gonna be a significant increase on the bottom line, which is gonna require a supplemental appropriation from this council, which is also gonna require us to amend a $192 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5957.282s">So</a> that's something that we're gonna have to really think long and hard about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5959.523s">I</a> certainly don't have a problem creating the positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5961.243s">Like</a> I said, if this is what we need to be successful to take this in-house, let's take a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5965.704s">But,</a> you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5968.323s">have</a> a parking enforcement director and three parking enforcement officers in the budget, and now to hear that we're gonna be having a department of 12 people plus a director, it's... But half a million dollars.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5987.59s">It's</a> not 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5987.93s">Well,</a> there's four full-time parking control specialists, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5990.971s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=5991.871s">Then</a> they said there were gonna be six
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6003.629s">And</a> one lead parking meter person. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6005.771s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6006.291s">Okay,</a> so six more, not nine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6224.201s">Quick</a> question, Mr. President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6225.581s">Has</a> a revolving account been established?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6324.157s">Mr.</a> President, motion to refer all ARPA funded positions to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6333.271s">Some</a> of these aren't ARPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6334.893s">Some</a> of them aren't, some of them are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6336.474s">Which</a> ones are ARPA positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6337.755s">I</a> think it's F and then I through O. Just some additional information for the city council's consideration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6383.284s">And</a> there's items, Mr. President, the amendments F and then I through O.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6455.732s">Is</a> there an N and an O? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6459.393s">The</a> one paper that was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6810.398s">I</a> certainly have no issue with Amendment G in my understanding is the same as yours Alicia, because it's paid out of a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6814.801s">There</a> was really no need for a cap because the grant defined what the compensation rate was going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6818.963s">Taxpayers</a> dollars weren't being used to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6821.344s">It</a> was being awarded to us from the feds. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6823.805s">In</a> terms of the staff planner in the economic development planner, these positions are not funded in the budget presently, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6831.889s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6832.249s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6832.57s">Were</a> they last year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6839.05s">You</a> said 17 through 20, so forget about the fiscal years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6843.574s">All</a> right, because I guess my question is, if we have no incumbent in the position, and there's no hiring plan to
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6859.774s">Okay,</a> so these are similar to the other titles that got brought forward that are ARPA funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6867.38s">Or</a> is amendment F and G both ARPA funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6870.443s">I'm</a> sorry, in my reading of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6874.666s">The</a> following ARPA funded position. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=6876.107s">13</a> doesn't talk about ARPA money anywhere.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7701.559s">So</a> meet on two, I don't think this is- Mr. President, I offered the amendment for the reason that there's no WAPA spending plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7706.801s">So,</a> you know, if we get $39 million- Ask these questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7721.807s">We</a> took the vote, we'll figure it out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7878.829s">Mr.</a> McNeely. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7881.89s">The</a> subject matter is contrary to law and reason.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7918.928s">It's</a> clear, Mr. President, the gentleman's here to do nothing other than cause disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/rk0Z0EFoxP4&t=7922.35s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_Cs57SkaizpQ/2024-11-19_Cs57SkaizpQ.html">City Council 11-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=83.971s">Mr.</a> President, the reason I ask for the rooms to be suspended is to invite Stephen South from Local 25 up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=88.733s">He's</a> here this evening to join us with a special announcement, I do believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=92.054s">I</a> was contacted by his office earlier in the week, and he asked that he be extended this courtesy this evening as the official bargaining agent for a number of units here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=99.896s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=214.429s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe I do believe Mr. South has had the opportunity to organize several bargaining units here in the community, maybe you could tell us a little bit about that I know we were able to recently approve the contract for our inspectors and recreation department.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=271.319s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President, just one more item Mr. President, before I wrap up, just one more item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=277.143s">It's</a> also been brought to my attention was the self that you've been able to organize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=281.808s">a</a> private entity that provides transportation services to our students here in the community?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=287.791s">And</a> you're in the process of negotiating a contract now?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=320.173s">I</a> thank you all for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=321.274s">Have</a> a nice evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=321.994s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=322.414s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe that this council has asked this question in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=325.915s">This</a> was something that I put forward a number of months ago, requesting that the administration disclose to us if there's any type of investigation going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=333.998s">I</a> believe this was something that got brought up maybe in, oh, May or June, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=339.54s">With</a> that being said, maybe it would be possible for the city clerk to provide us with a copy of that paper and the other response that the administration gave, and then we can forward that to Mr. Self as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=402.431s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=403.912s">Just</a> this past week, we had a very monumental transfer of ownership of Century Bank over to Eastern Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=410.395s">And</a> seeing this happen, it brought some sadness, whereas I've had the ability and <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=416.457s">fortunate</a> responsibility to work with the Sloan family now, going back to when I first got involved in government in the late 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=423.719s">The</a> Sloan family have been great, great, great advocates, great participants in our community, great benefactors, very generous people that have really helped make Medfed a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=433.481s">They've</a> invested not only their money, but also their time, their energy, and their efforts here to create jobs, to run a successful business, to build and develop, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=445.048s">and</a> help grow our community, but they've also been very philanthropic in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=449.731s">And</a> because of that, Mr. President, I offer this resolution and I thank you for co-sponsoring it with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=454.935s">And</a> I'd ask my council colleagues if we could be so kind as to extend the slightest bit of gratitude to the Sloan family based upon their 40 plus years of dedication and commitment to this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=843.632s">How</a> are they being paid.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1193.904s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1194.345s">Mr.</a> President, I do think it's also important to point out that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1199.879s">a</a> board of registrar voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1203.44s">And</a> I think that, you know, they've been left out of this process for pretty, pretty open to the point where they two of the three members resigned during the election process this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1217.882s">So</a> I think there's a, you know, something that's definitely worth discussing, Mr. President, and I support Council Marx's resolution and I will move to second it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1386.374s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1388.536s">I</a> noticed, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1389.076s">Brady,</a> that you said we. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1391.158s">Are</a> you here representing a group or an organization, or are you here as a citizen?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1397.002s">Do</a> you mean like as a volunteer in general may do this practice?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1405.669s">So</a> you're speaking as an individual today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1789.144s">I</a> understand that there's some emotions running high, but to keep insinuating, is there a criminal investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1796.288s">Is</a> there a criminal investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1799.49s">I'm</a> just thinking that, you know, the narrative is getting a little skewed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1804.673s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1806.414s">Let's</a> keep it to the facts, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1807.755s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1808.936s">Is</a> there a criminal investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1811.497s">I</a> mean, come on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1835.81s">So</a> I was like, this is- Wait, Mr. President, it was brought to my attention after having a conversation with the elections coordinator that because of the inordinate number of requests that the office was getting relative to the provision of certain documents that they sought advice from the Secretary of State's office as to how to handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1853.234s">And</a> then the Secretary of State's office said these requests can be handled as Freedom of Information Act requests.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1939.327s">The</a> Medford City Council doesn't perform election oversight duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=1942.449s">That's</a> what the board of registrars vote as far as, and that's what the secretary of state's office as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2000.025s">quite</a> frankly, I don't pay much attention to the functions of the office that falls under the purview of the administration that has a department head and a board that's required to make sure that they're in compliance with what's going on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2013.409s">It's</a> also the board of registrars of voters.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2018.05s">Are</a> you insinuating that the city clerk is conducting some sort of bad behavior or something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2022.351s">Because</a> if that's the case, we're really going down a slippery slope here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2096.678s">And</a> I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2098.318s">So</a> you did say that the Secretary of State's office did say to put these inactive voters back onto the active voters.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2129.78s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2130.2s">The</a> city clerk's office isn't the keeper of the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2132.101s">The</a> city solicitor's office is the keeper of the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2134.162s">So</a> the provision of the records would come out of the legal office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2360.637s">Anyone?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2361.117s">We</a> don't have the authority to recall an election that's been certified by the Secretary of State's office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2867.74s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2868.88s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2870.021s">When</a> I think of Brian Kerins, I first got the chance to meet him when he was with the then MDC. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2876.083s">And</a> then he had a brief stint here in the city of Medford, where he worked with Paul Gere, someone who he couldn't have been more different than. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2884.685s">And</a> when Brian came back, you'd see Brian with dirty boots, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2889.567s">yellow</a> reflective vest on walkie talkie always in his hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2892.948s">He</a> wasn't afraid to go out in the field to get in the hole, to be out there and working with his people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2897.809s">He</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2898.99s">Someone</a> that's going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2900.27s">I</a> do think I brought a wealth of knowledge to our community in terms of the operations of how public works is supposed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2907.892s">And</a> he's over the years gained <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2911.21s">a</a> great deal of institutional knowledge that we're never going to be able to replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2914.413s">And</a> we're seeing that more and more with these department heads that are leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2918.396s">You</a> know, we're losing a lot of institutional knowledge here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2921.098s">And,</a> you know, that's leading to certain situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2924.981s">But</a> it's my hope that we move forward and we find a replacement for Brian that will be able to fill the big shoes that he's left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2932.807s">And</a> I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=2936.27s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I second the council's motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4243.389s">Can</a> we just repeat it back, Mr. President, as to what it is we're looking for, if it's, we're looking for an explanation or we are looking for, you know, a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4252.457s">It</a> was the amendment, that's why I asked.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4472.884s">And</a> we can't burn them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4474.987s">Sorry,</a> we're not allowed to burn them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4477.689s">Don't</a> be able to burn in your leaves people.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4534.413s">I</a> too would request the same consideration as offered by Councilor Falco, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Cs57SkaizpQ&t=4538.376s">So</a> will you both be tabled?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1432.231s">Mr.</a> President, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1434.113s">Just</a> this past week, Ralph and Loretta celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1438.917s">Many</a> of us know Ralph and Loretta from being around the community, raising two lovely daughters, Lisa Evangelista and Julia Evangelista. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1446.304s">Many</a> of us know Lisa from her work in the mayor's office and from her work <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1449.572s">up</a> in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1451.153s">She's</a> been dedicated to our community for close to 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1454.356s">But</a> that is nothing compared to the dedication that Ralph and Loretta have shown each other for the past 60, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1459.861s">They're</a> the cutest couple you'll ever see, two peas in a pod that you'll see go everywhere together. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1464.645s">And</a> it's great to see that they've been able to celebrate this momentous occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1468.689s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in congratulating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1473.433s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1529.528s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1530.888s">As</a> we're all aware, this Thursday is Veterans Day, 11-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1535.269s">And</a> it's also the, I believe, 246th birthday of the United States Marine Corps, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1540.451s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, Medford has a very strong veterans population. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1544.472s">There's</a> almost 2,000 veterans that reside in this community that at one point in their lives signed the dotted line and said, I'm going to do more for my country. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1551.815s">I'm</a> going to do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1553.155s">And</a> these individuals sacrifice they spent time away from their family they put themselves in harm's way. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1558.057s">And</a> some of them are fortunate to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1560.578s">And</a> those are the people that we honor here on Veterans Day, Mr. President, all those who have served. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1565.04s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1568.861s">I'd</a> also like to offer that I've had conversations with Michael Durham. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1573.867s">down</a> the veterans office I bumped into him just the other day at the Mets donuts where he was making a purchase of 300 donuts to distribute to veterans mentioned veterans on Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1584.776s">So</a> with that being said was the president that for those veterans that are interested that please visit the veterans services website for more information but it will be a celebration Thursday coming out of the veterans service office on Iraq veterans with donuts from the Mets.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/h7LKHi60BVc&t=1748.441s">In</a> common custom, we've always invited the newly elected councils to come down and sit in the well behind the rail to observe as we lead into<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_uVH2naDKUEE/2024-11-19_uVH2naDKUEE.html">City Council 10-26-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1471.762s">What</a> if vice president, I'm hearing the city engineer say that we have somebody that's on site that works for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1480.062s">Why</a> is the DPW commissioner walking it if we have somebody that's on site that's supposed to be doing this anyway? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1485.025s">We</a> have somebody on site that's saying that's supposed to be overseeing the project and we have the highway superintendent, the DPW commissioner saying that's not up to specs.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1509.32s">They</a> are saying apples I'm saying oranges, what I'm saying I guess is why is it gotten to this point if we have somebody that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1515.605s">That's</a> supposed to be overseeing the project anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1518.006s">And,</a> you know, if in your expert opinion and in this gentleman's expert opinion, it doesn't cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1523.551s">We</a> have somebody that we've appointed and put in a position to be overseeing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1528.915s">Why</a> is it getting to this point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1541.544s">I</a> guess the question, who is responsible for the oversight of the project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1549.648s">Okay,</a> who is that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1555.723s">They</a> were hired before I started so it's not it's so it's not a it's not a person that works in this community that's assigned to do that it's a consultant or a contractor it's it's an outside source that's responsible for doing the oversight oversight it's not it's not like we have George Connie in the engineer's office that's responsible for it we've had some outside entity that we've contracted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1619.183s">Okay,</a> so we have AI engineering, who's the city's contract for the oversight of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1628.426s">How</a> often do they report back to the engineer's office with the specs and the like on progress of the project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1649.656s">And</a> then, did I understand you correct when you said that it's not part of the city's MOU or method standards to include regrading in this type of contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1660.022s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1672.934s">I</a> should tell my you and I have a number of conversations and I think we share some of the same concerns but I mean ultimately, if the community is going through years and years of inconvenience to get these type of projects, taking care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1683.899s">There</a> should be some sort of measurable mitigation that we can receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1691.868s">would</a> make sense to if they're going to be tearing up our streets in entirety to when they resurface them, resurface them at a gradient that's smooth, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1698.212s">I</a> mean, I think that that would only make sense to be included as part of the MOU and the specs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1703.575s">But</a> with that being said, you know, I appreciate the fact that we do have a field engineer, but I think that the work that is being conducted needs to be looked at a little bit harder and it needs to be inspected a little bit stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=1716.282s">And</a> the field engineer needs to be a little bit more calm.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4460.427s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4463.209s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4464.95s">If</a> they've done 22 days of blasting, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4469.182s">Sounds</a> like that breaks down to about five blasts a year, because this project has been going on for as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4475.809s">All</a> right, I mean, four years that we've seen this rock wall with a fence around it over there on winter street with no progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4482.997s">And</a> I think that the frustration is the fact that we've gone such an inordinate time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4487.762s">with</a> this parcel looking awful, they clear-cut all the trees, they started blasting, and then they just stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4493.227s">They</a> stopped everything, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4495.068s">And</a> now all of a sudden, they start back up, but nobody knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4498.632s">Nobody</a> knows why the project stopped and what brought us back to blasting today. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4504.056s">And</a> I think that that's really what the frustration is. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4506.438s">I</a> live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4507.179s">I</a> live across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4508.54s">The</a> blasting doesn't particularly bother me, Mr. President, not as much as the unsightly <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4515.122s">awful</a> looking curb appeal that that parcel brings to the community after what it was previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4520.704s">That</a> was a beautiful lot that had hundreds of trees on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4523.826s">Those</a> trees were all ripped down, taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4526.507s">Now</a> we have a rock wall and we've had a rock wall for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4531.509s">I</a> think this is a perfect example of some of the reasoning why we need to streamline our permitting processes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4540.907s">and</a> some of the reasons why we need to have better communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4544.331s">And</a> as I've said in the past, abutters advisory committees that can bring up the issues that affect the abutters in the neighborhood, the projects and where the projects exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4555.002s">An</a> abutters advisory committee in an instance like this would be perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4559.085s">would</a> be perfect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4560.886s">So</a> with that being said, I would re-introduce my call for about his advisory committees from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4565.668s">However,</a> that would be out of order because I had offered- I mean, in that form of amendments? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4568.809s">And</a> I had offered it previously, it would be out of order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4571.771s">I</a> rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4572.491s">However,</a> I do think that there's a great deal of frustration based upon the inordinate amount of time that it's taken to get this project to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4580.635s">The</a> condition of the site prior to the clear cutting of the trees versus the condition of it now, and the need for us to move forward <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4588.687s">redevelop</a> the parcel at this point, because what we have there right now is unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=4593.468s">Thank</a> you, Vice President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5199.882s">Mr.</a> President, motion to waive the reading and adopt the map as presented, copies of which can be provided through the city clerk's office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5213.032s">Mr.</a> President that a copy of the legal boundary descriptions be included as part of the record.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5420.832s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Falco for putting this agenda item on this evening, Mr. President, I think it's very important for us to really take a look at the financial impact <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5432.294s">relative</a> to personal injury and property damage that surrounds our lack of investment in infrastructure, and our inability to provide reliable consistent delivery of basic city services like the maintenance of Iraq keeps roads and parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5444.568s">So</a> I think consulate faculty put in this agenda item on the, the agenda this evening Mr. President, I'm looking forward to seeing those figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5453.202s">being</a> an individual who spoke a little bit about his property damage claim a couple of weeks ago driving down Mystic Avenue, that there have been close to 70, maybe 80 claims for tires alone relative to portals on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5467.96s">So</a> this would be an interesting figure to take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=5470.343s">I</a> thank the council for putting it forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6663.745s">I</a> think it's important to point out that the vote that came before this council when parking enforcement was implemented here in the city of Medford was nothing more than a vote to allow the administration to negotiate a contract in excess of 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6675.565s">That</a> was the only authority we gave the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6677.767s">It</a> was to negotiate a contract in excess of 36 months to create a parking program for parking enforcement here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6684.131s">That's</a> the authority we gave. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6685.352s">That's</a> the program that they came up with.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6768.611s">Mr.</a> President, if I could just further amend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=6770.964s">It</a> would be great to have the parking committee there, but if we're gonna be talking about what this program is gonna look like via fans, what's, how's, and the like, I think it's also very important that we have representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and our Disability Commission there as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7147.322s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7147.942s">Mr.</a> President, on that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7150.626s">I</a> think it's important to point out, we shouldn't be sitting here talking about how are we going to find investments in Hormel Stadium, when we have a Hormel Commission that's very capable and does a very good job, working on setting policy and establishing policy for our Hormel Stadium field. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7167.615s">The</a> Hormel Commission has the opportunity to generate revenues, Mr. President, when the stadiums open. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7172.597s">We</a> probably have the ability to generate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7174.498s">Oh,</a> it's probably say anywhere between three to $5,000 per week council Scarpelli might be able to correct me if I'm wrong to rental fees of the one third field alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7183.883s">A</a> lot more money, so a lot more so so how much council Scott probably per week you think we'd be able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7191.542s">So</a> between $7,500 and $10,000 per week, per week, when the stadium's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7198.165s">And</a> we've established a revolving account, Mr. President, so that the stadium has funds available so that it will become self-sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7206.188s">And</a> in this last budget, what we saw was a self-sufficient Hormel Commission, a self-sufficient athletic department that was booking the fields and generating quite a bit of money weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7220.391s">The</a> administration thought it would be a good idea to create a new job, $70,000 a year, and use revolving funds to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7227.634s">When</a> we had somebody, the athletic director, that was doing it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7231.436s">When</a> you talk about investment in the community, Mr. President, when you talk about investment in the community, we had someone doing the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7237.459s">We</a> created a job, duplicative spending, $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7239.96s">That</a> $70,000 could have gone back into the field, could have gone to the press box, could have gone to ADA accessibility at the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7249.058s">When</a> we talk about fiscal responsibility and elimination of wasteful and duplicative spending, this is something we have to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7254.48s">We</a> had someone doing the job for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7256.26s">We</a> created a new job for $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7257.421s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7260.882s">It</a> doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7262.883s">It</a> would have made sense if Hormel wasn't performing, but Hormel was performing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7266.944s">The</a> money was coming in, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7269.045s">Not</a> only were the revenues coming in, but there was a community need that was being met on behalf of our youth groups and organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7279.197s">I'm</a> very concerned about what's going on with home health. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7281.639s">I'm</a> very concerned about what's going on with LeConte Skating Rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7284.221s">I'm</a> very scared about the future and whether or not we see privatization come and take over these two facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7290.025s">I'm</a> very concerned about it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7292.567s">I</a> thank Councilor Falco for putting the matter on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7392.067s">But</a> point of information, Mr. President, I do believe that we have a revolving fund at the field of dreams as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7397.454s">You're</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7397.875s">And</a> at the field of dreams, we have two fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7400.358s">So</a> according to Councilor Scott Tully's figures, if managed correctly, then that would bring us close to somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000 a week in season.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7565.865s">If</a> I could just amend the paper, Mr. President, to request that we get a copy of the debt service schedule for the Field of Dreams to be sure that all of our bonded indebtedness has been paid off at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7577.291s">Good</a> question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7680.258s">Vice</a> President Knight, I think there's a bigger concern that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7685.32s">We're</a> all sitting here with masks on our face, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7687.581s">We're</a> being told to wash our hands 2,550 times a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7692.543s">When</a> we use the facilities, we're supposed to wash our hands when we're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7697.925s">When</a> we're going into a locker room and you have no ability to properly wash your hands, <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7706.718s">I</a> think Mr. President, we might have a concern relative to the state sanitary code. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7713.041s">The</a> pool is secluded in possible off area to the pool open to the public during certain hours and the rest of the school is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7720.724s">If</a> I'm using the pool and I need to use the restroom, am I supposed to wander around Medford High School to find a bathroom that has hot water so that I can wash my hands? <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7732.088s">think</a> you'll find them mostly closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7734.57s">Exactly,</a> exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7735.751s">And</a> the one that is open is no hot water. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7739.635s">So</a> I'd like to just request Mr. President, the Board of Health takes a visit up there to be sure that we're in compliance with the state sanitary code. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7749.884s">I</a> know this is not something that's new to the years of the school administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7753.307s">This</a> is something that they've heard about before the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7756.642s">something</a> that should have been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7757.922s">Now,</a> here we are in 40 degree weather, and it's still not something that's been fixed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7816.194s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7818.815s">For</a> many years the McDevitt family have been very good to me family that I consider very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7824.795s">Jack</a> was my favorite teacher at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7826.676s">Michael</a> and I are very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7827.916s">I've</a> had the opportunity to hear all of Jack's stories about Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Penelope, as he used to call them, when we were in first period law class my senior year in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7838.059s">And</a> since that time as the president, through the friendship that we've been able to develop through recent involvement in various public service organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7846.21s">But</a> with that being said, very recently, Mr. McDevitt lost his wife Jane. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7851.253s">She</a> battled with a long public illness and was infirm for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7855.134s">And</a> she had recently been put on hospice and was no longer able to keep up the fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7861.477s">And</a> she will be sadly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7863.658s">She</a> was a woman of great faith, an educator like her husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7867.38s">someone</a> who was very involved in the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7868.96s">Joseph's</a> Parish, and someone who will be certainly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7872.121s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my council colleagues to join in and extend the condolences to the McDevitt family during their time of loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7879.783s">If</a> you know the McDevitts, you know them to be people that put Medford first, the people that have public service in their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7886.124s">Michael</a> was just appointed American Legion post five member of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7891.566s">Jack</a> McDevitt has a list of students for the last 40 years at Medford High School that called him <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7897.347s">one</a> of the most inspirational, motivational, and favorite teachers that I've ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7902.23s">And</a> Jane did such a great job working with the students that she had in the city of Boston and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7906.572s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to extend these condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7988.277s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7991.078s">Billy</a> Butts was <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=7994.363s">a</a> one of a kind, as they'd say, started out a career in public service, working in government, if I do remember correctly, and went on to become a police officer, Mr. President, and he was one of those police officers that wasn't afraid to get out of the car, that did the job the right way, that put the community first. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8011.672s">He</a> was a proud parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8013.613s">I</a> had the opportunity to meet his sons socially on a number of occasions, and someone who really loved this community and loved serving the public as a police officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8022.838s">And</a> just earlier last week, he suddenly passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8026.801s">And</a> it was much to the dismay and sadness of many of us here in this community who had the opportunity to call him a friend, and who had the opportunity to see Billy in action and see him help so many people as a police officer here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8039.969s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would defer to you for further comment, but he will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8046.593s">And,</a> you know, times like this are very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8049.475s">The</a> gentleman, I don't think was retired from more than a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8053.923s">as</a> a member of the Metro Police Department for three decades plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8057.945s">So</a> when you hear that happen to somebody, it's very sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8061.046s">And</a> when it happens so suddenly, the impact that it has on the family is tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8065.107s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8533.549s">Gotta</a> mix that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8534.87s">On</a> that note, Mr. President, I would like to send a personal thank you down to Baird Haley. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8540.877s">and</a> Mrs. Joyce down in the elections office who have been a big help throughout this whole entire process with all the paperwork and everything else that's necessary for being filed and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/uVH2naDKUEE&t=8550.622s">They're</a> a great staff down there in the elections office and I want to make sure the clerk has me say this to him today before the election.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY/2024-11-19_IC6Elh6AwZY.html">City Council 10-19-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=165.439s">We</a> know what the options are in front of us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=172.665s">It</a> wasn't the presentation that was questioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=179.951s">Motion</a> to adopt this plan that makes no changes, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=493.004s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=494.324s">If</a> you recall, <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=496.678s">Some</a> years ago, probably, maybe two and a half years ago, this council had passed a resolution requesting that the operators, not only Asian Taste, but the operators in that stretch of buildings, refrain from parking on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=512.211s">What</a> was happening is people were using the handicap ramp as a driveway and driving up on the sidewalk because the sidewalk has a lot of width and a lot of space. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=520.458s">The</a> council had requested that bolus be put in and the bolus were put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=524.961s">However,</a> they will put him wide enough where vehicles could still drive up the handicap accessible ramp onto the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=531.583s">So</a> I just want to reiterate to the gentleman, I certainly have no problem with the license transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=535.964s">That's</a> an enforcement issue that should be handled through enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=538.605s">It's</a> really a function of the city administration, not this council, to ensure the vehicles don't park on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=543.726s">But</a> with that being said, with the license being transferred, I want to reiterate this council's position that that type of behavior is not <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=550.808s">something</a> that we'd like to see there at that location, and we've taken steps and voted affirmatively on a number of occasions to install safety measures to prevent it from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IC6Elh6AwZY&t=558.713s">So</a> I'm hoping that, you know, as we move forward, Mr. President, that the representative for the business entity can convey the Council's concern relative to the parking circumstances and situations at that location and make sure that they refrain from parking on the sidewalk in that spot.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=67.503s">To</a> our existing billboard before us this evening it was tabled for a couple weeks and I'm hoping we can pick that matter up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=326.017s">It</a> was a night. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=329.64s">I'm</a> very familiar with this parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=331.341s">I'm</a> very familiar with the billboard agreement that the city has with clear channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=336.485s">It's</a> not something that's negotiated by the city council the terms of the agreement of the terms of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=340.969s">I</a> think really the issue that's before us this evening is whether or not we're going to reverse the sign denial because of the denial that was issued by the building commissioner because it falls out of the scope of our sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=353.99s">This</a> billboard has always fallen outside the scope of our signed ordinance because it was part of a program that was negotiated with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=359.912s">In</a> order to allow the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs to make his parcel more accessible and more developable, I think it makes sense for us to approve this measure this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=369.694s">The</a> way that I look at this is we're addressing an environmental concern relative to the runoff and leakage and drainage problems that we have at the gentleman's parcel, and we're also getting upgrades <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=379.957s">to</a> the existing billboard to make it more environmentally friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=383.118s">The</a> transfer, it's going to help us out with light pollution and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=386.419s">So</a> I think that this is a measure, Mr. President, that's a win-win for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=390.101s">It</a> allows the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=392.702s">It</a> allows Clear Channel the opportunity to upgrade their existing equipment, and it allows us here in the city of Medford to have some of the best, state-of-the-art, most up-to-date equipment to utilize through public service programs that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=405.206s">So</a> I, for one, certainly feel as though this is a measure that the council should be approving, and I will move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1692.304s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1693.885s">As</a> we're all aware, if we've been paying attention to what's going on in this community, as of recent, the issue of 5G technology was certainly a concern.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1704.291s">Which</a> was 0 Goley Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1707.082s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1707.482s">Oh,</a> he skipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1708.142s">Oh,</a> he skipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1709.223s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1709.603s">We</a> can jump back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1714.605s">Mr.</a> President, why don't we get council Scarpelli's items out of the way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1723.248s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, the issue of 5g facilities in this community has been a topic of discussion and concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1730.411s">There</a> are many individuals in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1733.129s">that</a> have expressed some concern about 5G technology and the placement thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1737.15s">Recently,</a> the city's ad hoc small cell committee has approved 17 5G towers to be located in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1747.834s">And</a> I just want to be sure that the residents that are going to be abutting these 5G towers are notified of the circumstance that the approval has been awarded and whether or not there are any appeals processes for these abutters should they wish to pursue them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=1761.878s">So</a> that's the resolution in a nutshell, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2643.077s">So,</a> as you mentioned, that is what information vice president night, I do believe that would give us the capacity, though, to see growth of city population upwards of 38,000 people over the next 10 years without having to worry about having to do this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2655.359s">So</a> it seems like an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2657.2s">See,</a> you know, in fact, the voter had to be moved this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2663.381s">Once</a> it's done, it's done because we've been able to address the future population growth to such an extent capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=2671.463s">I</a> don't see it having to change again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3219.038s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3220.339s">As</a> you read off those names, I'm sure many of us see many familiar faces, hear many familiar faces that had the opportunity to run in the Boston Marathon just the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3229.287s">You</a> know, when you think about all the counsel Scarpelli's going through over the recent months to understand that his wife ran the Boston Marathon on Tuesday and then was there to support her family through this time of need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3240.738s">Tuesday</a> evenings is something that's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3242.6s">It's</a> just such a sign of what a strong woman she is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3245.303s">And</a> that goes for all of these athletes that participated in the Boston Marathon, Mr. President, because it takes a certain type of person to be able to run 26.1 miles consecutively with nobody chasing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3254.833s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's beautiful that these individuals were able to get out there and get back on the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3260.758s">and</a> follow the lead of Medford's own David McGilvery, race director, and enjoying yet another successful Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3267.98s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, it's quite a celebration, a full year's worth of training goes into this, and for these individuals to have the opportunity to participate in the fashion and way that they did, something that's truly beautiful, and it's certainly what athletics is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3281.124s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I want to extend my condolences, my sincere <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3285.965s">Congratulations</a> to these individuals for participating in the Boston Marathon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3289.368s">I'm</a> sure it would feel like a condolence the day after the marathon, but the accomplishment of completing it, Mr. President, is something nonetheless.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3964.233s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3966.673s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3968.793s">I</a> certainly agree with Councilor Marks in some aspects of this discussion that it does warrant further discussion, but <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3976.935s">In</a> terms of the matter that's before us this evening, I think it's something that we should sit down with the city solicitor and the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3985.612s">talk</a> about what it is we need to do to use the appropriate language to further enhance this local option. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=3994.639s">It</a> does warrant a bit of further discussion, and the reason I think it warrants a bit of further discussion is because I want to make sure that we do it right, so that these individuals that do become eligible for this deferment can apply for it and the council can do it procedurally properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4008.692s">When</a> you look at the deferment, it's a deferment. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4010.293s">It's</a> not an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4012.015s">The</a> individual is going to have to pay it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4014.316s">So</a> really what this does is it provides somebody with a housing stability option. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4019.159s">It</a> expands access to a safety net program, Mr. President, and it gives us another tool, the toolbox that we can use to help people here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4027.385s">Councilmax</a> makes very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4031.108s">Very,</a> very valid points. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4032.249s">But</a> ultimately, right now, with this matter before us, we have a piece of paper that allows us to exercise a local option that's within our scope, purview, and discretion of this council to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4044.458s">And</a> I think it <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4046.52s">you</a> know, highlights the value of deferment when we talk about all these issues that are going on in this community and the push and pull of people, a feeling when it comes to the pocketbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4056.584s">So</a> for those reasons, Mr. President, I certainly support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4059.445s">I</a> think it's a great idea, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4061.386s">I</a> wonder where you got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4063.026s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4065.948s">And</a> I'm hoping that we can meet on it in a committee of the whole with the assessor and the city solicitor to further discuss it because I do think it provides value to the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4074.635s">What</a> it does is it says if somebody has a difficult time paying, they can come to the city and if they meet the income guidelines and the qualifications, they can defer those payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4083.321s">I</a> don't think that there's anything scary or wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4086.543s">I</a> think that's a service that we could provide here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4089.325s">And</a> I think that it's something that would be beneficial to not many, but some. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4093.348s">And</a> if we're helping somebody, then we're doing good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4095.269s">So</a> for those reasons, I support the paper, Mr. President, and I'd suggest that we meet the committee of the whole.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4953.424s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4955.245s">I</a> think it's important to point out, Mr. President, when we set the tax rate this past year at $9.43 per thousand dollars of valuation for residential properties, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4963.542s">One</a> thing that we did discuss was the residential property tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4967.265s">And</a> when we went through this exercise in determining whether or not that would be something that was good for the community, I believe what was established was a break-even point of $727,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4975.551s">So</a> any home that was valued over $727,000 that was owner-occupied would not see <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4985.452s">an</a> increase in the tax bill of the percentage that we so chose to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4991.915s">In</a> fact, what they'd see would be an increase in their tax bill above and beyond what their regular taxation would be without an owner-occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=4999.519s">So</a> there are over 4,000 homes in this community, Mr. President, that are over the $727,000 breakeven point, and over 1,300 of those homes are occupied by individuals that are senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5013.105s">So</a> that is why the Metro City Council, when we set the tax rate, did not adopt the residential exemption, if I remember correctly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5021.368s">But</a> I just want to get that out there, because I know Mr. Castagnetti asked why that wasn't adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5026.649s">And</a> that's why, because there are 4,000 homes that are owner-occupied in this community that would see an increase in the tax bill, not a decrease in the tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5035.472s">and</a> with the breakeven of $727,000 a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5037.373s">We're</a> an owner-occupied home owner, say, in East Ford, at a two-family home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5046.415s">It</a> sounds like you may actually be above and beyond that breakeven point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5049.696s">You</a> could actually probably see an increase in your taxes, not that owner-occupied exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5053.937s">So</a> that's why the council did not adopt it in the past, historically speaking, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5198.02s">Well,</a> Mr. President, if anything happened to me at the barbershop the other day, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5203.368s">as</a> I drove down Main Street and merged onto Mystic Avenue, then was right in front of Exploit Towing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5211.631s">The</a> pavement gets a little milled, a little rocky. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5215.212s">There's</a> some construction going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5216.692s">And</a> there's a number of castings, Mr. President, along that stretch and further down where they're doing this work that aren't clearly marked. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5223.634s">And</a> I got two flat tires. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5226.475s">driving</a> down Mr. Cab the other day, Mr. President, on Wednesday night, because the casting wasn't clearly marked and I nailed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5233.236s">And</a> as I was commiserating over my experience at the coffee shop just the other day with Tom Tedford from Export Towing, he started laughing and told me that he does between 15 and 20 tires a week right at that location, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5249.62s">So</a> something's wrong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5251.76s">Something</a> needs to be done to protect those that are traveling by motor vehicle, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5256.011s">uh,</a> down Mr. Gavin new during this construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5259.194s">Um,</a> you know, we're all anxious and looking forward to seeing Mr. Gap be fully resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5264.218s">But</a> in the meantime, um, the 15 to 20 tires a week to get torn up, that's 15 to 20 taxpayers in this community, uh, that are going to be put through an inordinate inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5275.568s">And,</a> um, also what we're going to see, Mr. President is a rising claims, the property damage against the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5281.753s">If</a> in fact, we don't take the appropriate steps to properly mock these castings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5285.894s">So</a> with that being said, I ask everybody to feel bad for me because they have two flat tires in my car and also move approval on the paper so that we can get the area or at Mystic Gap a little bit safer during this construction period, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5299.493s">That's</a> a moral.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5364.609s">I'm</a> a desk geek. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5365.23s">I</a> don't know what the best practices are or what they use out there in the construction field, but I'm sure that they get something better than my idea out there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5422.737s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5424.198s">After</a> having a whole summer off the first day of school, the city decided that it would be a good day to start a water main project on the roads abutting being Prescott Street, which I'm pretty sure you're familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5439.938s">And</a> over the course of time as the presidents in school, open those some six or seven weeks ago, what we're seeing is on various days certain roads are closed, no vehicular access during drop off period that coupled with the fact that we have, you know, gigantic dumpster construction materials and debris. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5457.313s">in</a> construction equipment parked along Prescott Street and along other side streets that are above the school, creating a situation that makes it difficult to pass, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5465.317s">Oddly,</a> number two, and a concern for the children, number three, Mr. President, there in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5471.419s">It's</a> a request to ask that the city engineer restrict the hours of construction for this project until such time as the students are in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5480.263s">School</a> starts about 8.30 in the morning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5482.744s">The</a> construction crews like to get out there at 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5484.785s">or</a> so. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5485.609s">and</a> that hour-and-a-half window is creating a certain situation down at the school in terms of traffic gridlock, inconvenience to drop off of parents and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5495.652s">Yeah,</a> coupled with the fact that if you used to go in a certain way, Mr. President, you'd drive down, say, Old Canal Street, and you'd take a left-hand turn onto Prescott, and then it says Prescott Street's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5506.835s">What's</a> your option? <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5507.455s">You</a> gotta go over the train tracks, turn all the way around, come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5511.336s">It's</a> just a really inconvenient situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5512.917s">It</a> doesn't really, <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5515.822s">It's</a> not conducive to the free flow of traffic or a safe drive off to children down there in the area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5520.885s">So</a> I just ask that the city engineer revisit the practices and hopefully come up with a plan that's a little safer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5707.322s">Mr.</a> President, as Councilor Falco has added me to his resolution, I defer to him first.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5731.628s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5732.448s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5733.769s">Yes,</a> Mary was someone who always loved watching the city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5736.85s">And</a> I remember quite frequently talking with her daughter and granddaughter about the goings on in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5741.871s">And</a> every once in a while, we'd get a request from Mary's daughter or granddaughter asking for a congratulations or a birthday shout out to Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5751.075s">And</a> she really got a kick out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5752.975s">She</a> was a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5754.116s">She</a> raised a great family. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5755.316s">And</a> she's going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=5756.757s">So</a> to Lauren Feldstrong and you and to the O'Sullivan family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6114.262s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6115.203s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6116.684s">As</a> most of you know, I have a background in organized labor, and when it comes to someone that was a fiery advocate for his membership, you couldn't find anybody better than Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6128.631s">When</a> you talk to the current firefighters that have <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6131.473s">been</a> around for a long time, that can share some of those old stories about what it was like negotiating contracts and going into the war room and fighting for what you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6140.961s">They</a> said that Joe was just quite a leader, Mr. President, someone whose actions spoke louder than his words, someone who wasn't afraid to fight the good fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6149.208s">He's</a> going to be sadly missed, his efforts, energies, and certainly his commitment to Local 1032 will not go unnoticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6157.074s">Everybody</a> I've talked to <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6158.87s">has</a> only had fond things to say about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6161.252s">And</a> everybody I've talked to has said what a legend that this gentleman was in terms of advocating and fighting for his members.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6338.888s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6341.269s">Mister</a> president on that point, I know that I believe it was Council of faculty with all the turnover and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6346.071s">I'm</a> not sure we asked at this point, I think it might have been either Dave Rodriguez when he was here or at least not only when she was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6352.973s">If</a> we could get a copy of the organizational chart after the passage of this last budget, we saw a couple of new departments get created, a couple of new positions get created, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6362.577s">And</a> there was a lot of talk and discussion about what this organizational chart was going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6366.558s">before</a> all the turnover in the corner office occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6369.32s">I</a> was wondering, I know we've asked for it, I don't think we've received it, so I wonder if we could just reiterate that request, Mr. President, to get a copy of the organizational chart.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6447.663s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6449.023s">Mr.</a> President, on that note, actually, here we are now where <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6453.817s">about</a> a quarter of the way is in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6455.918s">Next</a> week, I will be putting forward my request for an update on the city's financial health. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6460.559s">That</a> was a request that this council have put forward a resolution this council passed asking for quarterly updates from our CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6466.421s">But</a> right now, I don't believe we have a CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6470.154s">So</a> I think it's very important that we have this financial update ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6474.437s">So</a> I'm asking, Mr. President, that you get in advance of me putting this on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=6478.56s">Rob,</a> make sure you reach out to the administration and let them know that that's coming so that we can possibly have some- You can send me an email on that tomorrow, what you want, and I will take care of that.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7300.2s">That's</a> a street opening permit, so the police would have to be there for the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7303.644s">The</a> police get the detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7304.865s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7305.265s">So</a> any road opening has to have the detail there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7307.688s">The</a> city engineer signs off on any type of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7310.811s">The</a> city engineer has to sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/XqTRewGiIAE&t=7312.773s">Chief,</a> a police can't say, yeah, go open the street and do construction.

<a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2441.252s">When</a> do we stop acting like we're the First Amendment police? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2443.932s">Because</a> we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2445.553s">This</a> is a matter that should be before the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2448.405s">It's</a> a matter that should be before the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2449.786s">It's</a> liable. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2450.286s">It's</a> slander. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2452.727s">It's</a> a civil issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2453.688s">It's</a> not an issue for the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2456.029s">I</a> feel terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2457.209s">I</a> feel terrible for the individuals that are mentioned on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2459.771s">Many</a> of them I know well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2461.491s">Many</a> of them I know well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2463.693s">Growing</a> up with them, going to school with them, know their children, have coffee with them, the Met's donuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2472.737s">Many</a> of the statements that are on that site I don't find to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2476.022s">That's</a> my perception based upon my experiences with these individuals in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2480.504s">But</a> Mr. President, we cannot be the Facebook police. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2483.705s">We</a> cannot be the social media police. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2485.566s">If</a> that's what we're going to turn into, we're going to waste a lot of time focusing on efforts and endeavors that don't move the city in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2493.309s">There's</a> a lot of good things that are going on in this community, but if you watch our meetings, you'd think Medford is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2499.111s">Medford</a> is not falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2500.773s">Medford's</a> not falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2501.853s">There</a> are a lot of good things going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2504.054s">We</a> need to straighten the ship out. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2505.374s">We</a> need to straighten the ship, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2507.295s">But</a> ultimately, at the end of the day, in order to straighten the ship, we've got to focus on the issues that are important to move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2513.376s">And</a> I don't think that us policing the Internet and posts, private posts on the Internet, are where we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2518.777s">That's</a> just my personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2520.238s">Again,</a> I feel very, very sorry, very badly, for individuals that are named on that website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2524.619s">No</a> family should be put through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2526.487s">As</a> public officials, we know what we sign up for. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2528.728s">We</a> sign up for the abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2530.249s">Individual</a> private citizens don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2532.47s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2532.771s">So</a> I'm very, very, very sorry that you have to go through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2535.692s">And</a> I hope that you get the recourse that you need to reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2539.234s">But</a> the Medford City Council isn't the vessel, the vehicle for you to get that accord. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2543.617s">The</a> court of law is where you're going to get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2545.018s">It's</a> a civil matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2547.619s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2548.4s">Councilor</a> Morell.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3598.755s">Council</a> Vice President, it looks like eight feet doesn't look like it's much of a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3602.818s">This</a> seems like it's something that would probably take about a half of a day or a day to complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3606.141s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3607.322s">Well,</a> a few hours or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3609.443s">A</a> few hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3610.504s">Move</a> approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3711.782s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3713.503s">Last</a> week, there was a meeting relative to the revitalization of Carr Park and the design and construction thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3720.107s">Several</a> weeks before that, this council, I believe, did appropriate some money from the Community Preservation Act to authorize this project to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3730.072s">And</a> when this meeting was scheduled, I did receive a number of phone calls from area residents who expressed some concern about the final design and what the final design was going to look like and the impact that it was going to have on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3741.258s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it would make sense for us to request that the mayor put together an abutters advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3747.799s">So</a> it'll be a group of abutters that live beside the project site, maybe one or two from each street that abuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3755.761s">And</a> what happens is they can kind of act as the point person for the residents on their street to discuss the neighborhood concerns that are coming up relative to design plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3763.442s">I</a> know that there's some discussion about putting walking trails, for example, in between the buffer strip. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3768.843s">between</a> the park and the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3770.383s">So</a> I know that some residents have expressed some concern about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3773.324s">I</a> know there's been some discussion about what type of equipment is going to be installed in the playground and whether or not there's going to have adaptive equipment there for children with special needs and disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3782.685s">I</a> know that there's been a lot of discussion about what the final walking track is going to look like around the track and whether or not they're going to be able to loom and see the whole field and so forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3790.627s">So</a> I think it would make sense for us to have some partners that are part of an advisory group that can sit there and work with the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3798.668s">as</a> well as the design team and our friends on the community preservation committee to ensure that the neighborhood concerns are getting addressed as this project moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3806.62s">I</a> think it's a great project for the neighborhood, it's a great project for the community, but we need to protect the neighborhood and the residents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3812.668s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we do have a resident <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3815.652s">from</a> Harrison Street, Harris Street rather, and Mr. Marino that wants to talk a little bit about his experience at the meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=3822.618s">I'd</a> obviously defer to my Councilors to see if they have anything I'd like to add, but this is Mr. Marino here as well to join us to discuss this issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4049.933s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4051.716s">I</a> think the conversations that Mr. Marino and I had concerning this project, it's not that there's an opposition to the project, but anybody in the neighborhood wants to stand in the way of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4062.549s">What</a> they want to do is be sure that the project comes out in a fashion <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4066.994s">that</a> delivers the best benefit for the community, but also protects the residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4072.456s">You</a> know, so this committee could be tasked with the function of determining what types of plants are going to be used as the buffer zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4080.058s">Are</a> they going to have thorn bushes and tall trees or are they going to have this type of tree or that type of tree to keep people away from the properties? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4086.92s">Can</a> we talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4089.066s">where</a> the path is going to go, how far away from the properties it can be, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4093.468s">We</a> ran into a situation with the Clippership Connector where the residents felt as though they didn't have a voice, Mr. President, and I think that this right here will allow us to get ahead of that and not see some of the same mistakes repeat themselves that have in the past on projects of this sort.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4655.048s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly will second the motion, but this sounds very familiar to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4661.975s">We</a> did bring this up in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4663.196s">I</a> do believe you did make this request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4675.767s">You</a> raised the issue when the administration wasn't aware of the money that was associated with the billboard agreement at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4681.631s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4682.011s">And</a> then we need to expend, I think, those funds before the close of the fiscal year, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4688.235s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4690.396s">By</a> 630, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4690.816s">I</a> mean, that's what it was at. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4691.817s">So,</a> very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4692.977s">Yeah,</a> I appreciate you bringing this up again, Councilor Falco, and I certainly look forward to the results of the administration's response.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4698.981s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4846.501s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4859.529s">I</a> grew up in the West Metro part of the city and I went to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4862.593s">Joseph's</a> Parish, that was my parish, and about, you know, I guess 25 years ago or so, a group of friends and I decided we were going to try out for a basketball team up at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4872.447s">Francis.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4873.495s">And</a> there's a gentleman sitting across from me who didn't cut me, Coach Falco, kept me on the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4879.839s">And</a> that was the first time I had the opportunity to meet now City Councilor John Falco at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4887.204s">Francis,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4888.265s">But</a> one thing I realized coming from such a strong parish at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4891.607s">Joseph's</a> and going up out of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4893.388s">Francis</a> and playing basketball at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4894.849s">Francis</a> was the great sense of community that they have up there and the great strength of that parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4900.012s">It</a> wasn't a Sunday that you'd drive by the parking lot and think for a second that you'd be able to find a spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4905.354s">It</a> was a very, very active parish, very active parishioners, a great Mother's Club, if I remember correctly, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4911.337s">I,</a> too, want to join my council colleagues in extending a deep congratulations to St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4916.759s">Francis</a> of Assisi Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4919.28s">I</a> wish the school was still there, but it's quite an accomplishment for a church to last that long, especially in this region when we're seeing so many Catholic churches close down. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4927.403s">So</a> congratulations to the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4928.583s">Moritzes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4940.106s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4941.386s">In</a> our packets this evening, you'll see that we have received correspondence from the mayor relative to the mayor's ad hoc small cell committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4950.948s">And</a> in that packet, we will see that the committee found that <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4958.974s">17</a> 5G facilities have been approved here in the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4965.96s">Zero</a> Goley Road, zero West Street, 24 Pearl Street, 26 Royal Street, 48 Clock Street, 40 Ashland Street, 12 Fulton Street, 43 Woodrow Ave, 123 Grant Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4986.531s">Zero</a> Logan Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4988.355s">Zero</a> Brookside Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4991.461s">83</a> Washington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4992.463s">39</a> Charnwood Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=4995.802s">163</a> and 199 Forest Street, 59 Jerome Street and zero Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=5002.769s">So,</a> Mr. President, those 70 plus applications that were before us before the city for quite some time and we're nearing the subject of litigation have been addressed and it appears that the Mayor's Ad Hoc Committee has granted 17 <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=5018.005s">of</a> the initial applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=5019.906s">I</a> know that this was an issue of concern out there in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=5023.067s">So</a> I'd just like to ask that the city administration do a robocall to the residents on those streets to inform them that these 5G towers have been approved.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3090.081s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I appreciate you co-sponsoring this resolution with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3094.184s">Paul</a> McGillivray. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3095.609s">born</a> and raised on Marion Street in South Medford, son of Harold McGilvery senior, a very, very, very recognized cop that served in the city of Medford on the NBC was injured in the line of duty and actually passed away very recently from the injuries that he sustained on that fateful night. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3113.141s">Following</a> in his father's footsteps, Paul became a Metro Police Officer some 25 years ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3118.124s">And</a> during that 25 years, Paul was so happy to say when I spoke to him the other day with a smile on his face that he had an unblemished record. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3125.428s">In</a> 25 years of service as a Metro Police Officer, he had a perfect record, an unblemished record. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3130.33s">And</a> for 25 years, he served his community. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3132.592s">But</a> a number of years ago, he moved up to the town of Wilmington, where he and his wife, Andrea, began to raise their wonderful family. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3139.295s">And</a> Paul had a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3141.158s">to</a> transfer departments and to now work in the town that he lives in. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3144.3s">So</a> born and raised in Medford, he had the opportunity to do 25 years here in the city of Medford, protecting the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3149.585s">And</a> now he's gonna have the opportunity to do that up in Wilmington, the town that he lives in. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3152.887s">So</a> I wish Paul the best of luck to his health, to his safety, and most importantly, to his happiness, to have the opportunity to be close to his family, to be in his neighborhood and to work in his hometown is something that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3163.175s">It's</a> something that we all relish. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3164.616s">So</a> I congratulate him and I wish him the best of luck moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3167.819s">He's</a> a great individual, just a great person to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3170.481s">A</a> lot of fun, a lot of knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3172.342s">A</a> cop's cop, as they like to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3175.685s">He</a> gets out of the car, he does his job, he does the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3178.366s">He's</a> someone that's gonna be sadly missed, and they're gonna have a big pair of boots to fill down there at Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3183.069s">With</a> Paul McGilvray leaving, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=3184.891s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6300.0s">I</a> certainly disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6301.7s">Diane</a> McLeod did yeoman's work on this when it came to diversity and disability issues, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6307.047s">Um,</a> I mean, she would, she'd be in her office with blueprints on restaurants being made and making sure that there were accessible pathways for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6313.473s">Um,</a> and it was a diversity and disability office. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6315.675s">Um,</a> we've seen the focus of the office change. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6317.978s">Um,</a> we've seen the office actually be proposed to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6322.225s">And</a> that was the priority that this council made, to keep the diversity office alive, because that office was going to be gone entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6328.511s">Entirely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6328.951s">It</a> was just going to be the office of human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6331.553s">There</a> was not going to be an office of diversity inclusion anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6334.096s">It</a> was going to be gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6334.776s">And</a> that was the stand this council took. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6336.998s">We</a> said, there's going to be a circumstance or a situation that comes up where the director of human resources is sitting on an interview panel, say, and an individual that's interviewed feels as though <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6349.994s">There</a> was some miss miss malfeasance or what we're giving a fair shake the civil rights of violate whatever it was, who do they go to the human resource officer to just sat on the panel just told them they don't get the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6361.297s">That</a> was the conflict that we were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6362.838s">That</a> was the first sign that we really saw that we need to make a commitment to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6368.082s">We</a> can talk all we want to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6369.683s">But</a> at the end of the day, where do we put the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6371.444s">We</a> put the money into the diversity office. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6372.885s">We</a> made it a council priority to keep that diversity office alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6375.767s">And</a> that's what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6376.848s">I</a> mean, I think when we look at the steps the administration's taken, we're seeing a lot of press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6382.452s">We're</a> seeing a lot of press releases. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6383.553s">We're</a> seeing a lot of Facebook posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6384.694s">But</a> we're seeing a lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6386.775s">We're</a> seeing a lack of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6387.816s">We</a> have a communications director that does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6390.017s">She</a> has a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6390.818s">She</a> puts a great press. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6392.539s">But</a> we need to get in the same room and sit down and talk about some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6395.901s">And</a> it's not just related to issues of race and equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6399.103s">It's</a> related to fiscal responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6400.784s">It's</a> related to service delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6402.305s">There's</a> a real breakdown in communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6405.947s">My</a> father was a great athlete. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6407.068s">He</a> was the athletic director over at the city of Somerville for, I can't tell you, 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6411.651s">He</a> always talked about athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6413.012s">And</a> he said that an athlete's number one ability is their availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6416.556s">If</a> they're not available they can't play, right, if the mayor is not available to take these conversations with us and to come to our meetings when we ask her to be here to address issues of inequity, then how are we supposed to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6432.401s">How</a> are we supposed to move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6433.362s">We</a> can all stand behind the rail, and we can bang the table, and we can give the good speeches, and we can talk for 20 and 30 and 40 minutes at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6438.646s">Listen,</a> everybody behind this rail can talk, and we can talk the dog off a meat wagon, every single one of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6442.789s">You've</a> seen it before, and you'll see it again, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6445.031s">But</a> at the end of the day, it's all smoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6447.593s">It's</a> all smoke, unless, like Councilor Falco says, someone takes that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6452.356s">That's</a> the mayor's roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6454.118s">That's</a> what it says right on the top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6455.599s">That's</a> who's in charge of that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6457.04s">The</a> mayor's in charge of that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6458.221s">That's</a> the mayor's roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6460.117s">The</a> mayor's roadmap, not the council's, not Neil Osborne's, not anybody else's. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6464.199s">That's</a> the mayor's roadmap. <a href="https://youtu.be/es9I6cVv7DI&t=6465.26s">And</a> that's who should be owning this.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4233.063s">I</a> do believe it's state law that veteran service officers have to be veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4238.765s">So,</a> unless the chief of staff is a veteran, the veteran service officer work should be performed by the veteran veteran service officer, a member of the veterans organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4249.869s">I</a> mean, if I'm correct, and you look at the state law, I believe the state law says that no one can serve as a VSO that's not a veteran.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4467.387s">because</a> it's a violation of the open meeting law and also to find a vote will be a bad vote the council can get find the council has established rules the rules indicate that you know it just doesn't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=4481.233s">I</a> mean you got a portion of the law got to play the game by the rules.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8091.772s">concur</a> with everything you've said. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8093.553s">I</a> think when you look at these two individuals, I read in the paper, I think it was over 70 years of law enforcement experience here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8103.52s">I</a> wish them both the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8105.521s">We</a> got very familiar with Lieutenant Rudolph during the budget process when he came up here to speak about the police dispatches. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8110.925s">And</a> I've been very familiar with Captain Conway because he lives down the street from me and he has the most meticulous yard and the coolest looking fence out in front of his house that you'll ever see. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8121.352s">quite</a> quite quite a outdoorsman, Mr. President, when it comes to maintaining his property. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8125.537s">So</a> I look forward to seeing him out there more often when he has more time on his hands now that he's a retiree. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=8130.582s">So</a> with that being said, I second your motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9280.002s">Mister</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9282.283s">Linda</a> Pittorino is one of the unsung heroes of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9286.885s">Works</a> down in the Metro Consumer Commission, helping out consumers file complaints against unscrupulous scammers and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9297.208s">But</a> with that being said, just recently, Linda and John celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9302.29s">Over</a> the years, I've gotten to know both John and Linda very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9305.653s">They're</a> a great couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9306.613s">They're</a> two little lovebirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9307.874s">You</a> can't miss them. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9308.675s">You'll</a> see them at the Little League Field watching little Johnny play t-ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9312.497s">And</a> I had the pleasure of playing against their grandson this year a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9317.001s">And</a> to see them there cheering on their grandson is really something else, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9321.424s">I've</a> really come full circle for them, and I wish them all the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9323.965s">But</a> Linda and John are two great people, and they found each other 50 years of wedded bliss, and I wish them 50 more.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=9502.102s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10416.708s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10420.249s">That</a> would be my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10422.984s">to</a> pay Paul and we're going to say give us the Silver Line but we don't want a one seat, one ride express buses and that's a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10431.526s">I</a> think anybody in this community that wants to take public transit would much rather get on the bus in Medford and take a express bus right down to Haymarket than to get on the Silver Line and take that Sullivan Station or Wellington Station and then get on a train and then take the train to Haymarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10449.41s">That's</a> just my opinion being a <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10451.275s">the</a> former commuter into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10453.756s">It</a> wasn't necessarily always the prettiest ride when you took the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10456.358s">That</a> one seat, one ride was very much more enticing than to have to do the switch. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10462.781s">That's</a> why, you know, Express Bus Commuter Rail always seem to be great options for us here in the community and it hate to implement this this silver line project that would eliminate the one seat, one ride options that we <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10480.59s">hamper</a> our ability to restore them back to the level that they were at previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10485.873s">I'm</a> certainly aware that we do need to have many more transit options here in the city of Medford for our community based upon our close proximity to the city, the congestion that we have here in the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10500.141s">certainly</a> would warrant additional resources from the MBTA in terms of service provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10505.384s">The</a> question is, are we robbing Peter to pay Paul to get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10508.706s">You</a> know, we're getting the green line and as the green lines coming to fruition, we're seeing our express buses get eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10514.409s">Now,</a> if we petition for the silver line and we get the silver line, what is going to be that opposite and exact reaction to that action? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=10523.994s">I</a> guess that's the question because it's all driven by ridership.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11555.577s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11556.437s">I</a> think it would also be important where, you know, the disease of addiction has plagued our community now for the better part of a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11564.062s">It's</a> not something that... <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11565.942s">anybody's</a> immune from it's not something that we haven't been afraid to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11569.843s">It's</a> something that we put on the forefront, and we have an office of prevention we have pennies office up there that's doing a great job and you know if we have a situation where someone's battling addiction is in need of help. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11582.228s">I</a> think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11584.12s">Turning</a> it into a police issue is one thing, but we have resources that are available as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11588.681s">And</a> I don't think this is something that should necessarily be turned into a police issue to quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11593.743s">Correct</a> definitely quality of life issue but I don't think it needs to be a police issue per se. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11597.844s">If</a> someone is in the community struggling and needs help and we have the resources available I think that they should also be brought to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11604.046s">So</a> with that being said, I just asked that our Office of Prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11607.407s">maybe</a> Officer Lockowitz be included in the discussions moving forward because they do a great job up there and they've helped a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11616.033s">And</a> that's what we're all here to do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11617.193s">We're</a> here to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11618.234s">So,</a> you know, I think that that's probably a good recommendation, Mr. President, to have friends from the prevention office be a part of this discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11672.585s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11678.286s">Mike's</a> not doing outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11679.887s">Start</a> doing outreach in that area because we know it's a problem area. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11683.047s">They</a> don't need to come to one of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11684.388s">They're</a> going to hear the same thing we've told them time and time again, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=11686.988s">I</a> mean, I think ultimately, you know, we need to ask them to go out to these hotspot areas and start performing outreach work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12239.1s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12243.305s">The</a> packing program first rolled out some 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12248.629s">One</a> of the biggest criticisms that we received as a community was what's wrong with you rolling out this program in the middle of the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12260.337s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12261.318s">And</a> now here we are rolling out the program again, 10 years later in a January, the month of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12267.642s">We</a> have to learn from our mistakes at some point, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12278.862s">It's</a> going to look like a gone show right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12283.203s">It's</a> going to look like a gone show. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12285.624s">We</a> don't have the capability at this point in time with the funding that was in my budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12290.665s">So</a> what close to half a million bucks, I believe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12301.181s">It's</a> not going to cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12302.342s">It's</a> not going to cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12304.862s">And</a> that's your personnel cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12307.123s">Good</a> luck getting a director for that salary, Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12309.304s">And</a> the idea is that this is going to be a self-sustaining department that's going to have a revolving fund, where the revenue that they bring in is going to make it so self-sustaining that we're not going to have to ask the taxpayers to chip in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12322.507s">I</a> don't think that's going to be the case at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12324.708s">I</a> think that we're going to end up seeing numbers that are worse than the numbers that we see right now with Republicans. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12329.33s">just</a> because Republic has the expertise and knowing how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12332.773s">Right</a> now, we're starting off like the bad news bears.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12648.53s">I</a> think one of the things that we need to look at that we haven't looked at in recent years that we did look at previously was the water table. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12660.233s">The</a> level of the water in the lakes, using the locks to control the water table so that we have the ability to sustain significant rain. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12670.775s">You</a> know, I think it's one of the detriments to losing, you know, such a high level of institutional knowledge over such a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12679.379s">As</a> we've seen, you know, a lot of people, a lot of turnover, we lose that institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12684.481s">And</a> then when we start relying on, you know, planning agencies and outside entities to come in and do the planning for this community without that institutional knowledge, it creates a situation for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12695.287s">So</a> when we look at the project on High Street, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12698.648s">where</a> the resident was told that the catch basin was going to get tied in for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12703.729s">The</a> catch basin never gets tied in. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12705.369s">Now</a> they do this project and the resident gets six feet of rainwater in their basement because the lack of institutional knowledge, lack of follow-up and institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12716.491s">I</a> think it's important, Mr. President, that we, you know, the employees that we value that have this institutional knowledge, we need to keep around. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12722.693s">I</a> think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12724.713s">One</a> of the things that I really think we do need to look at is the water table and the level that we keep the lakes at. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12730.178s">It's</a> always been historically something that, you know, I remember as a kid did always lower the level of the lakes in the rainy season and always let it come back up in the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12737.663s">I</a> think it's something that needs to be looked at.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_tT-sIarT8Q&t=12742.782s">That's</a> Falco.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8/2024-11-19_sPI3fdyUva8.html">City Council 07-13-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=154.05s">The</a> representative from the administration might want to explain what's going on with this, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=182.506s">Mr.</a> President, maybe we can have a representative from this newly organized employee group come up and explain to us what this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=189.012s">I</a> know that this is something that's been long awaited. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=192.515s">We've</a> been waiting for a long time for this contract to come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=194.736s">So</a> maybe someone can be here to fill us in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=383.473s">Mr.</a> President says, be it further ordained, the positions outlined herein will be removed from their current classifications as they appear in the current classification and compensation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=394.004s">So</a> it looks like we're passing it, and then it looks like we're eliminating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=397.706s">Be</a> it ordained that the following classification plan is adopted, we're adopting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=401.387s">And</a> then it says, be it resolved that the positions outlined herein be removed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=526.542s">Mr.</a> President, where we have waited 19 months, 20 months for this contract to come to fruition, something that started during the previous administration and was negotiated almost to the end of the current administration, I would offer the motion that <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=540.375s">the</a> additional readings be waived and the employees before us this evening be afforded their cost of living increase ASAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=547.138s">This</a> would be a retroactive increase to January 1st, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=551.019s">So</a> that's about seven months of benefits that these employees would be able to receive should we waive these additional readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=558.082s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=562.544s">That'll</a> be a motion, Mr. President, to waive the additional readings on the passage of the ordinance.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1666.449s">I</a> mean, I think it might make sense for us for approval, even to sit down with the assessor to, you know, define the parameters of what we're getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1673.534s">And</a> I don't think it, you know, it's commercial property. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1675.755s">We</a> have a commercial tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1676.896s">We</a> have 108 feet of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1678.777s">So</a> I think that's not going to be a formula that's going to be too difficult for us to put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=1683.18s">But</a> I think it's something that we should know.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3902.572s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3905.054s">Recently,</a> Mr. Buckland passed away very suddenly. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3908.618s">And</a> for those of us who don't know who Ray Buckland is, he's probably <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3913.263s">one</a> of the greatest athletes to come out of high school and one of the greatest people to ever come out of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3920.289s">Ray</a> had a very exceptional basketball career at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3923.052s">He</a> went on to play basketball at the Division 3 University of Massachusetts at Boston, where he went on to become a three-time Division 3 All-American. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3931.22s">It's</a> an unheard of accolade. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3933.081s">After</a> his graduation as the president, he went on to play professional basketball all over in Europe, but he always remained true to his roots here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3939.905s">And</a> he could always be seen coming back to Medford to visit friends and family alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3944.428s">He</a> was someone that had the blue and white in his veins, who carried himself with pride and was a great friend to many. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3951.793s">I</a> recall stories of Mr. Buckland often coming down to Bradshaw Street to visit Mr. Bates, and the stories that they tell about Ray could go on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3961.858s">But</a> he was a great gentleman, a great person, a great friend, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3965.08s">He</a> was a loving husband, a loving father. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3967.041s">His</a> son had a very successful baseball career up at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3969.902s">Mary's</a> in Lynn and Salem State. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3971.652s">And</a> when you talk to Ray, that was one of the proudest things that he had to talk about was his son and the success that his son had in athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3977.321s">Ray</a> had a great career in public service as the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3982.368s">a</a> worker at the Lynn Housing Authority for a number of years, and he just recently retired and celebrated his retirement after 30 plus years of service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=3991.334s">So</a> after his unexpected death, his family has certainly gone through a lot of trial and tribulation, and it's my hope that this council will join me and Councilor Scarpelli in sending our condolences and support during this trying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4003.923s">So</a> I thank you all for allowing me the opportunity to present this resolution on behalf of the Buckland family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4197.308s">If</a> you look at Ray's obituary, there's a line in what you just said made me think of it, but I believe at the end of Ray's obituary, it said, heroes never die, but legends live forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4207.393s">And</a> those are certainly words that represent Mr. Buckland.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4251.644s">I</a> can't believe that it was 20 years ago that Jason sissy or opened up chromatic tattoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4256.607s">It</a> seems like it was just yesterday that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4259.247s">Prior</a> councils were discussing the merits of the House of Payne tattoo application and the Painted Bird tattoo application and Chromatic Tattoos tattoo application. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4268.594s">And</a> here we are 20 years later, Mr. President, and he's been operating very successfully in the area, in the region, without a glitch, no problems, no issues, no concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4277.601s">Mr.</a> President, a very successful business, very highly rated on Yelp. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4281.083s">He's</a> got quite a cult following, but more importantly, Jason's a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4286.118s">contributing</a> member to our society, contributing member to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4289.899s">He's</a> very concerned about the cleanliness in front of his shop and the cleanliness along that stretch at Sammy Petrella Corner by Bella Ravioli, an Oasis restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4298.58s">And</a> he's someone who's not afraid to put his money where his mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4301.241s">And</a> anytime you drive by the shop, you can see Jason out there picking up cigarette butts and making sure the trash is emptied and making sure that the garden beds are weeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4309.322s">But</a> he's also running a very successful business, putting in hours and making sure that the residents of this community are provided a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4316.02s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues in supporting me and approving this resolution, move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4377.129s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4378.71s">There</a> aren't too many people in the history of this community that have their own day annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4384.415s">And</a> Brian rabbit is one of those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4386.316s">Brian</a> was a longtime employee of our public works department. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4389.739s">He</a> worked in the water department <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4391.394s">And</a> some people said he might have been the hottest working man in show business. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4394.275s">There</a> wasn't a time that you didn't see Brian where he didn't have his work boots on, dirt in his hands, and he was ready to climb in or climb out of a hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4401.138s">And</a> Brian was also someone that would have gave you the shirt off his back, the last dollar in his pocket if you needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4406.68s">And</a> that's why when Brian got sick, so many people came out to support him and to thank him for the type of person that he is and for all the contributions that he's made to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4415.944s">And</a> in an effort to recognize Brian, Mayor Burke at the time established <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4422.178s">Brian</a> Rabbit Day, July 20th, 2019 was the first Brian Rabbit Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4426.419s">And</a> it's been celebrated annually since then, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4429.66s">And</a> I don't want this to be something that gets forgotten with the change of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4432.82s">So</a> with that being said, I'm bringing this matter forward and I'm asking my council colleagues to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4437.422s">We</a> can have a moment of silence and recognition of Brian Rabbit, someone who's been loved in this community, who dedicated his whole entire life to working in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4444.803s">And</a> hopefully moving forward, Mr. President, we can have more celebrations like this in memory of Brian and his life.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4662.005s">I</a> believe that the Cannabis Advisory Commission was supposed to define those parameters. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4668.15s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4747.265s">I</a> do believe that public hearings dictated by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4750.587s">And</a> the guidelines and requirements dictated by state law are pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4753.67s">They're</a> outlined in, you know, I think 44A section 5 about public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4758.113s">But</a> I think that that's the parameters that they're going by.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4879.571s">Mr.</a> President, I just think it's important to point out that the salary for these two positions would be $100,928.70 annual per position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4884.513s">Say</a> that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4884.853s">$103,928.70</a> per position annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4885.373s">On</a> CAF 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4885.553s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4886.053s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4886.753s">Okay,</a> any further questions on this one before we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4889.434s">Okay,</a> amendment B, new and amended positions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4932.92s">Mr.</a> President, I just think it's important to point out that this position of parking enforcement officer in recreations facilities coordinator would bring a salary of $64,666 and 68 cents number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4946.565s">Number</a> two, I'd like to ask why the position of parking clerk is being proposed to be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4951.347s">Number</a> three, recreational facilities coordinator is nothing more than pork. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4957.041s">Nothing</a> more than pork, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4959.202s">$65,000</a> to pay somebody to do a job that somebody was already doing as part of their salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4963.665s">There's</a> no need for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4964.946s">That</a> should be a program coordinator's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4967.628s">That</a> should be a program coordinator's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4969.209s">That</a> should be someone that's delivering programming for the youth of this community, programming to the recreation department, not scheduling fields for $65,000 a year when we had somebody that was already doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4979.732s">All</a> right, so I don't understand the reasoning or the motive behind creating this position, other than the fact that it seems like it's a nice new job to create for somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4992.138s">But</a> at the end of the day, someone was doing it, Mr. President, for $65,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4996.02s">We</a> had somebody doing it for $0 a year as part of their salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=4999.262s">So</a> I don't understand why we're bringing this position forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5001.683s">Quite</a> frankly, I don't think we need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5004.328s">and</a> I'm not gonna be able to support it this evening, the creation of the recreational facilities coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5010.136s">Also,</a> Mr. President, looking at this, I don't see a need to eliminate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5014.157s">the</a> title of parking clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5015.458s">We</a> can keep it in the CAF as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5017.098s">We</a> can have a parking clerk and we can have a parking enforcement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5019.58s">I</a> don't see a need to eliminate the parking clerk title because we're gonna need a parking clerk if we're gonna have in-house parking programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5029.044s">So</a> with that being said, my recommendation would be to strike the position of recreational facilities coordinator from the document and to keep parking clerk in the document.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5040.849s">And</a> I'll put that in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5167.193s">So</a> the program coordinator position, we're just gonna call it a facilities <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5172.245s">coordinator</a> position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5173.266s">So</a> I guess they're not going to be doing the duties that they're assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5176.148s">Oh,</a> they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5176.588s">I'm</a> confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5177.529s">But,</a> um, in terms of the, um, year round programming at La Conte rink, um, it's been brought to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5184.213s">There's</a> been a lot of discussion about privatizing La Conte rink and, um, a longterm lease agreement with the Boston Imperials to allow them to use this as their home rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5192.519s">Is</a> there any truth to that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5221.103s">So</a> I'm talking about privatization of rank operations, whether it be the Boston Imperials or anybody else, has there been a discussion about privatizing the rank operations?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5247.861s">I</a> would like to offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5250.043s">So</a> your motion was to strike the position recreation facilities coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5254.105s">The</a> mayor just said, it's really going to be a program coordinator's position anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5256.946s">We</a> already have a title for that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5328.065s">Mr.</a> President, it's not a maintenance position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5329.966s">I</a> don't know what improvements they're gonna be doing down the rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5331.788s">I</a> don't think they're gonna be painting and fixing benches and sweeping and cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5335.29s">But</a> like I said, we had the athletic director that was, since we've taken over all the fields in the rink, he was doing it as part of his salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5342.636s">This</a> is $65,000 of expenditures that I don't think we need to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5345.738s">So</a> that's why I offer the amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5459.807s">One</a> information, I'm not saying don't put a fourth person in recreation, I'm just saying make it a program coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5464.449s">We</a> don't need to hire a $65,000 scheduler when we had someone doing it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5473.428s">I</a> want the department to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5474.609s">I</a> want them to have more personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5475.91s">I</a> just want the personnel to be utilized in a position where we're delivering a service to the public.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5480.794s">Good</a> evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5577.374s">So</a> are they gonna have supervisory responsibility?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5600.368s">The</a> recreation coordinator is going to be responsible for the scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5603.188s">of</a> the facilities and also the staffing of the part-time employees and the oversight of the part-time employees?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5616.532s">And</a> presently, do you oversee the staff at Hormel and La Conte?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5620.533s">Presently,</a> you oversee the staff at Hormel and La Conte?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5623.714s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5653.678s">Separate</a> them if you want, Mr. President, then I'm sure people don't care about the parking clerk job.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5676.354s">And</a> keep the clerk.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5960.965s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5962.565s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5963.105s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5963.706s">I</a> just, I just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5966.288s">So</a> we have the chief people officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5968.57s">So</a> the people that he'd be the chief of would be the staff, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5971.452s">The</a> staff in the building.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5979.738s">He's</a> the chief people officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5982.12s">The</a> people that he's the officer of is the staff, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5984.161s">So</a> he's the chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5985.462s">We</a> already have one of those, don't we?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=5996.95s">So</a> why don't we just call the human resource director.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6179.022s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6180.363s">Vice</a> President, I certainly have no problem with the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6183.246s">It's</a> the rate of compensation that I question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6318.57s">In</a> the process, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6320.351s">Vice</a> President Knight, has the work that Mr. Durham has done been reflected in his compensation? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6325.894s">Has</a> he been made whole?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6329.817s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6331.538s">So</a> he's not owed from 2-120 to 7-920?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6543.987s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6546.769s">And</a> also, I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, when the administration first presented <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6553.325s">the</a> idea or the theory to merge diversity and human resources in January of 2020, this council opposed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6561.672s">We</a> asked, we said, is this a conflict of interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6563.753s">The</a> city solicitor came back with an opinion that said it is, but it isn't, but it is, but it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6568.898s">So</a> then we said, we're opposed to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6570.239s">And</a> we sat down and we made our council priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6572.16s">And</a> when we made our council priorities, we said we wanted a standalone diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6577.044s">And</a> then we got a budget and the budget didn't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6580.387s">The</a> budget didn't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6582.595s">on</a> June 30, the last day of the fiscal year, we were presented a budget and the budget bifurcated the position said, Hey, we gave you what you wanted vote for it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6590.639s">This</a> was something that was a year and a half in the making. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6594.201s">It</a> shouldn't have been done in the 11th hour.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6621.744s">That</a> comparable CAF 21 position was the Director of Budget and Personnel, that was Richard Lee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6626.107s">So</a> he handled all the budget direction and all the personnel direction in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6629.609s">Now</a> we have three people that do that to the tune of $307,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6631.91s">We</a> had one person that did it for 90.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6713.177s">Discussion</a> on Amendment D. Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6715.998s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6716.838s">Again,</a> I see no reason to eliminate the position Assistant City Solicitor slash Hearings Officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6721.94s">I'd</a> like to further amend that to add Assistant City Solicitor Hearing Officer, Assistant City Solicitor City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6732.756s">Assistant</a> City Solicitor, City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6742.881s">I</a> move for approval of that and the elections coordinated position. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6746.523s">So</a> there will be four positions in CAF 11? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6748.504s">We</a> created CAF 11 for Assistant City Solicitor for the City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6755.247s">So</a> we're going to amend the title Assistant City Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6757.611s">We're</a> going to create or create another one assistant city solicitor slash hearings office so we could have assistant city solicitor slash city council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6803.021s">But</a> those negotiations haven't happened.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6813.488s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6814.089s">I</a> don't have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6814.809s">I</a> don't have a problem laying that on the table for a future date. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6819.984s">or</a> even withdrawing the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6822.046s">Council</a> Bess.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6838.023s">If</a> we went that way, Mr. President, we never would have had a director of substance abuse and prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6841.425s">This</a> council sat down and we created the position director of substance abuse and prevention, and then we pressured the administration to fund it, and then we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6847.13s">Prior</a> to that, we didn't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6880.941s">Yeah,</a> that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=6883.202s">So,</a> any further-
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7112.911s">What</a> information? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7113.733s">Budget</a> passed with the salary that's attached to this calf, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7135.327s">The</a> grant dried up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7136.527s">That's</a> the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7138.167s">When</a> the grant dried up, the job dried up. <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7139.628s">We're</a> creating a new position now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7158.128s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, through you to the administration, the mayor has no problem voluntarily allowing this position to join a union should they wish to, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7168.274s">Say</a> they wanted to join the clerical union, that wouldn't be a problem, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7183.183s">I</a> guess the question would be what would be your objection?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7196.386s">And</a> I mean, cause I don't think that this job has any confidential responsibilities in terms of personnel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7246.87s">Do</a> the duties and responsibilities reflect a situation that would preclude them from being able to join a union?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=7268.6s">Yeah,</a> I think that they might be, should be a better fit for the contract we just passed tonight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=8045.5s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/sPI3fdyUva8&t=8047.421s">I</a> see no reason to schedule a committee of the whole on these if we're not gonna have the other titles before us that we might wanna have a committee of the whole on as well.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA/2024-11-19_4FrRjkCyMqA.html">City Council 06-29-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=451.157s">A</a> motion to suspend the rules to take several papers out of order, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=460.748s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=462.069s">Paper</a> 21431, Mr. President, a common victuals license. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=466.754s">Which</a> one was it? 21431.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=560.532s">Vice</a> President, a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=562.273s">First</a> of all, Mr. President review of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=564.354s">It</a> appears that this entity has the ability to employ over 100 full of part time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=569.456s">So</a> this seems like this will be something that's a great addition to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=572.878s">However,</a> in looking at the application, the petition does seek hours from six a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=577.14s">to</a> one a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=578.18s">And</a> that would, I believe, require them to petition this council at a later date for an extended hours permit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=712.825s">Vice</a> President Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=714.447s">This</a> was a paper that was tabled a couple of weeks ago at my request as I was seeking a double pole to be removed from Burgadave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=720.992s">This</a> paper was requesting a grant location to access the Greenland extension to provide certain services from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=728.718s">Double</a> pole has been removed and I'd like to thank my friends at Verizon and their Comcast for the work that they did in making sure that that happened expediently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=735.481s">Last</a> week, I forgot to take this off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=737.583s">The</a> president put it up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=739.464s">So</a> I'd ask my colleagues to stay in the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=741.786s">I</a> do believe we have Karen Levesque that's going to be joining us from Verizon on the call.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=766.083s">Mr.</a> President, this is the paper that would provide access to the Greenland extension for certain public utility services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=772.065s">There's</a> a lot of work that's going on in that area right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=774.906s">I</a> do believe resurfacing plans are on file with the city engineer's office, and I certainly have no problem with the petition and move for approval of the paper.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2979.045s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2979.585s">Great</a> testament on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2989.788s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2990.969s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2991.809s">As</a> amended, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2995.07s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2996.39s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2998.291s">The</a> ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2999.551s">The</a> motion passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3002.612s">Council</a> paper 21428 offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3006.346s">Be</a> it resolved, the city council asks the city solicitor for a ruling on whether the council, through city ordinance, can craft the process for the naming of any municipal or school building or facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3016.129s">The</a> chair recognizes Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3421.923s">The</a> way that I'm reading this is no more than the councilor asking a question as to whether or not the Medford city council is a legal authority to establish and define a process to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3430.208s">It's</a> not in from what I can read a motion or an attempt to preclude <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3435.682s">any</a> elected body from exercising their rights, what it's doing is establishing, requesting more or less an opinion as to whether or not a universal and standardized process can be crafted so that that can be utilized across all realms of government when it comes to the renaming of any type of facility of the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3456.276s">I</a> don't really think we need to split hairs over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3458.318s">It's</a> not like we're trying to step on anybody's toes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3460.399s">All</a> we're doing is asking the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3461.859s">can</a> we establish a process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3463.1s">And</a> if we do establish that process, is it good for the school department as well as the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3467.903s">I</a> don't see what's scary about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3469.104s">If</a> in fact, it comes back with the answer that's a yes, then that's a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3473.287s">But</a> until we get there, I think that there's no harm in asking the question as presented.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4165.07s">Mr.</a> President, I found this to be an appropriate expenditure of the community preservation funds, and I would second the approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4715.429s">Mr.</a> President, nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4716.769s">I</a> certainly can appreciate the measure in terms of when it comes to cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4723.671s">I</a> don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4727.371s">I</a> do have concern over the process and when we make this determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4733.012s">if</a> there's 15 candidates today, but there's 27 tomorrow, you know, where do we draw the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4739.473s">I</a> guess the question that I have, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4741.073s">Do</a> we wait till the papers close? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4742.074s">How</a> much time do we need to get this legislation to get passed before we have to, can we do it after the paper deadline closes, but still have enough time to pass the normal petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4750.735s">You</a> know, those are some of the questions that are from an operational standpoint that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4755.256s">And</a> I think that because of those questions in the past, we haven't really acted on a measure like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4762.213s">that</a> couple with the fact that the city charter defines how we're supposed to move, leaves this up to be really a philosophical argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4770.998s">I</a> certainly can support the idea of about $50,000 worth of cost savings, number one, and the uncertainty surrounding the ability to get the mail-in voting approved prior to the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4782.746s">So</a> those are things that would certainly warrant some consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4787.509s">And</a> if this Home Rule petition is something that does come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4790.261s">Those</a> will be the items that I'm thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4793.024s">I</a> certainly don't have a problem putting the question before this body, having us deliberate that to a full extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4799.052s">I</a> think that's kind of like the intent of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4803.497s">The</a> council has put this paper forward to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4806.42s">I</a> certainly don't have a problem having a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4808.142s">I</a> don't even have a problem having the whole petition drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4810.762s">and</a> having us have the opportunity to discuss and debate about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4814.264s">Um,</a> you know, so with that being said, I can support the paper this evening if we're asking for a future beating for some defined parameters on how we're going to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4823.409s">But,</a> you know, at the same time, a child does call for preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4827.972s">Uh,</a> you know, there's 15 candidates in the race. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4831.174s">Um,</a> so it is what it is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5505.851s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5507.832s">This</a> is an exercise that we usually go through every year right around this time at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5511.275s">We</a> close out our books, balance the budget, make sure that all the accounts have a zero balance at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5517.239s">Normally,</a> when we go through this exercise, our finance director is available to provide a little bit of a background and give a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5524.584s">I'm</a> wondering if Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5525.465s">Nunley</a> is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5526.185s">Yes,</a> she is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5527.768s">Mr.</a> Clerk, can you unmute that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5647.849s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5650.67s">Any</a> further discussion on transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5653.932s">With</a> this transfer, Mr. President, are we in compliance with municipal finance law?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5828.588s">So</a> is it safe to say, Alicia, that we have a $12 million structural deficit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5872.181s">Okay,</a> and then what is the structural deficit presently if the budget were to pass this evening?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5935.725s">Right,</a> and last year we used about $5.5 million in reserves to balance the budget, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5942.309s">So</a> how much money in reserves are we using this year to balance the budget?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5965.863s">Except</a> for this grant money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5967.544s">This</a> grant money dries up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5975.667s">So</a> this is non-recurring revenue after the next four years?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6003.652s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6004.695s">if</a> by 2024 we don't realize this $12.34 million annually, we're going to be in a situation after this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6027.5s">recover,</a> then we're looking at a situation where we might have.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6038.67s">So</a> what's the plan in terms of between now and then to bolster our reserve in case we don't recover?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6088.264s">I</a> have one more question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6089.845s">This</a> looks like it's a two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6091.945s">It</a> says one, will you create the AFA grant account two, will you appropriate the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6095.246s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6098.847s">Will</a> we need to take two votes?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6109.516s">I</a> think one's a spending paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6118.998s">I</a> think one requires five and one requires four.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6266.984s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6268.385s">Vice</a> President Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6269.186s">This</a> council did make a request that line item 10153502 be reduced in the amount of $81,600 and that fund be reappropriated to part-time or full-time salaries in the law department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6281.394s">I</a> do not believe we received an answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6283.816s">Is</a> there anybody available that could give us an answer to that question as to whether or not this recommendation would be taken up?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6297.123s">This</a> is surrounding contract and legal services for the city council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6307.992s">It</a> was a request, a recommendation to your office to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6310.674s">We</a> made a recommendation to your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6312.336s">We</a> were wondering if that recommendation would be something that would be taken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6315.579s">There</a> was no response and that wasn't included in the correspondence that your office forwarded to us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6356.774s">My</a> concern at this point is with the legal office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6359.556s">I</a> know that we got a correspondence about the other stuff, but the question that I have pertains just to this particular request. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6365.62s">The</a> request was that we recommend that the line be reduced and that the administration reallocate those funds voluntarily to the full-time or part-time salaries in the office, so that we would have an assistant city solicitor in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6377.188s">That</a> was the question that was asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6380.05s">We</a> recommended that the administration do this voluntarily, and we didn't receive a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6384.652s">If</a> the response from the administration has now reduced the line item, then I'll offer that motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6389.314s">To</a> reduce the line item.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6439.513s">It's</a> very encouraging that we now hear that we have the ability to talk to Copeland and Page. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6442.956s">We've</a> been asking for two years for draft ordinances to be sent to us, and they've taken an inordinate amount of time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6469.882s">I'll</a> just use an example of the short-term lodging ordinance that we asked for in January of 2020, and we still haven't received. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6478.424s">So</a> we had to use Mr. Boborowski, our outside counsel, to provide that documentation to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6484.345s">I'm</a> not going to go tip the tab, Mr. President, on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6487.346s">This</a> is something the council's made a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6489.006s">We've</a> asked for our own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6490.286s">We've</a> not been able to secure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6492.987s">That's</a> a line item that we've asked for in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6495.887s">I</a> also made a case that we should have an assistant city solicitor in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6500.346s">um,</a> not outsourced. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6501.687s">Um,</a> that's something that I feel very strongly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6503.93s">Um,</a> so with that being said, I'd make a motion right now for a council vote that contracted legal services line item 010151530200 be reduced in the amount of $81,600 president.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6605.633s">Right,</a> but when Mr. Silverman was here, or Jonathan was here, I forget his last name, we asked him, who do you work for? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6612.874s">Do</a> you work for the city council, the city of Metro, the city administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6615.975s">And</a> he said, we work for the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6618.075s">That</a> was his response.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6847.479s">You</a> know, the issue of this conflict of interest can be addressed very, very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6852.961s">And</a> it could be addressed very easily by recreating an assistant city solicitor position to the City Council in a part-time role. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6861.055s">that</a> provides the council with the direction and advice and guidance that it's looking for in a confidential matter as their client, while also reporting to the city solicitor to be sure that it falls in line with the solicitor's opinions relative to legal questions and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6875.706s">So</a> with that being said, that's why I offer the amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6878.788s">That's</a> why I offer the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6879.828s">I</a> think it's a race to the bottom and we outsource every type of decision-making process in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6885.793s">We</a> have no institutional knowledge, no control, no direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6889.295s">And</a> that's why I offer the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6890.988s">I</a> offer the amendment to reduce the line item so that we can hire an assistant city solicitor in a part-time basis to represent this council on issues like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6897.092s">And</a> that'll address the issues of conflict of interest because they'll report to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6901.594s">There'll</a> be our legal counsel that will provide us with confidential advice, but at the same time, they will report to the city solicitor and the city solicitor's opinions will control. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6909.259s">They</a> won't be able to issue contradictory opinions because there'll be an employee in the solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6913.682s">They'll</a> just be assigned the task of working with the council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6930.061s">Wait,</a> was she Friday?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6934.083s">You</a> did?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6942.446s">So</a> he has the right to provide legal opinions now for the city of Medford?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6948.763s">So</a> I'm just wondering why the solicitor, why we didn't have the solicitor present when we requested their presence.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7040.075s">And</a> I can appreciate I can appreciate them as the president at the end of the day, it's been a four year legislative priority for the council to attain legal counsel for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7047.838s">It's</a> been a four year legislative priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7049.678s">It's</a> been put out as part of our council priorities during that time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7953.541s">There's</a> a motion on the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7955.582s">Why</a> don't we vote on the motion, and then if this passes, the mayor can come back with a plan, and then we can ask for supplemental spending to appropriate the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7961.925s">I</a> mean, there's no guarantees that we're going to get anything once we pass this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7966.146s">Once</a> we vote on this budget, vote on this money, you know, it's going to go back to the coroner's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7969.828s">Then</a> either it's going to happen or it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7971.669s">If</a> it doesn't, what's our leverage? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7973.849s">So</a> you want to vote on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7974.83s">I'm</a> saying if we say, OK, we'll reduce the budget by this much, come back to us with the plan, ask us for the money to be reappropriated again in a supplemental spending packet, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7983.192s">we'll</a> be happy to consider it provided that the council's brothers are met in terms of having a one point person point of contact that we can pick up and call and ask for legal advice that's gonna respond to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7995.556s">That</a> would be my recommendation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8000.218s">I</a> made the motion to reduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8002.539s">I</a> already made the motion to reduce.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8031.012s">What</a> I'm saying is we have $81,000 in the contracted legal services line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8035.595s">I</a> know that, you know, 20,000 of that's dedicated to labor services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8038.757s">So</a> I didn't be happy with the 60, moving the 60,000 out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8042.583s">and</a> reducing the budget by $60,000 out of the contracted legal services line item until such time as we can negotiate what satisfies us for legal representation here as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8052.508s">And</a> once we negotiate that, then you can come back to us for the additional $60,000 in the supplemental spending packet like you did earlier this fiscal year when you asked us to amend the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8061.292s">You</a> could again come to us and ask us to amend the budget after we negotiate what's gonna work for us with KP Law and legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8067.475s">We</a> could reduce the budget now by the 60,000, which is the amount of the KP Law contract <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8071.659s">We</a> could sit down and we could come up with an agreement that would, you know, satisfy the brothers of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8076.523s">And</a> then once we reach that agreement, the administration can present to us a supplemental spending paper that asks us to increase the budget by that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8083.948s">But</a> at that point, we'll be able to get our legal counsel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8100.081s">So</a> that would be the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8101.301s">Reduce</a> the budget right now by the $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8104.462s">Negotiate</a> the idea with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8107.643s">We're</a> going to reduce it by 60,000 until we have the opportunity to have a legal counsel that's going to meet our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8113.084s">It's</a> been a priority for this council for how many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8116.965s">I</a> think the mayor is making a commitment now that she's willing to work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8119.666s">So</a> why don't we let her get to work on that and then we can appropriate the funds once we have an agreement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8129.676s">$60,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8129.736s">I</a> mean, you could print rebel stamps for us too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8133.517s">But</a> at the end of the day, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8135.398s">There's</a> some needs and desires.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8186.382s">vote</a> to reduce the budget and pass the budget this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8188.263s">But</a> certainly the mayor could come back to us with a supplemental spending packet that addresses some of the concerns that we have, for example, the caps.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8204.053s">The</a> initial recommendation was to reduce it by the total line item, but I do understand that the line item represents two different types of contracted legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8212.058s">One's</a> KPLR in the amount of $60,000 and the other one is <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8215.041s">labor</a> council service, the remaining I believe was labor council service. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8218.103s">So</a> I'd even be satisfied offering the motion to reduce it by 60,000 at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8223.066s">And</a> now the administration may stand right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8224.947s">I</a> mean, it's not like this is a secret, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8226.708s">We've</a> been talking about it for eons now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8228.549s">You</a> know, today's January 29th and maybe we're going to get somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8233.072s">But</a> at the end of the day, if we reduce this line item by 60,000, put it back on the administration to come back to us and give us what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8240.116s">So,</a> I mean, I think it's a sticking point for all of us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8336.466s">Our</a> next meeting's on July 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8337.727s">It's</a> 20 days away. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8340.168s">We</a> can work this out in two weeks and it'll be over with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8341.908s">I</a> don't think there's gonna be much of a disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8347.73s">It's</a> my intention to vote in favor of the supplemental funding provided that the council gets what they're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8352.491s">I</a> think it's everybody's intention to do that if that's the direction we wanna go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8356.313s">It's</a> not like we're gonna <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8358.07s">hold</a> this up, but ultimately we've been asking for something up, uh, better part of 24 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8362.173s">And</a> today's the last day of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8363.754s">And</a> now we're finally getting somewhere, you know, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8373.08s">Mr.</a> President, the amended motion would be to reduce the contracted legal services line item 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 3 0 2 in the amount of $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8384.547s">then</a> the administration knows what our intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8386.369s">They</a> can come back to us with a supplemental spending packet if they're able to work out an agreement between this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8392.758s">And</a> I'd be happy to let the council president serve as the negotiator for this body to come up with that agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8398.781s">Mr.</a> President, so that would be my recommendation on the money, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8402.582s">$60,000</a> from 0101515302. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8402.802s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8403.363s">Councilors,</a> a motion to the floor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8427.591s">For</a> the purpose of? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8428.752s">allowing</a> the 20 days of contingency spending?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8437.235s">I'd</a> certainly be willing to reduce the figure to allow them to continue through July in the amount of, what's it, $5,000 retainer per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8445.418s">I'd</a> be happy to be amenable to that, to let them get through the month of July with their retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8450.9s">So</a> $55,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8451.081s">So</a> it'd be reduced by $55,000, leave $5,000, and they'd have to pay the bills for July.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8608.581s">Um,</a> does the election coordinator position have a cap that's been established by the city council?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8647.545s">Okay,</a> so this is a new position, there is no CAF. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8650.246s">You</a> are aware of the opinions the solicitor wrote? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8656.089s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8656.569s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8657.91s">The</a> chief of staff has come before this body and has explained to this council that it's his legal opinion that if the council passes the budget that contains a position <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8666.865s">that</a> that automatically amends the CAF ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8669.726s">I</a> don't find that to be the fact because the budget that's before us is a spending paper and the budget that's before us requires us to go through a certain process and an ordinance requires us to go through a much different process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8681.551s">So</a> with that being said, you're asking us to support a paper this evening that doesn't have a classification that's been established or approved by this council, is that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8736.025s">I</a> understand that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8738.705s">What</a> my concern is is that, you know, if it's the opinion from the administration that we don't have to create a cap, they can create positions and classifications, just put people in them and bypassing the budget, that's a constructive acceptance of the ordinance change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8753.4s">that</a> creates a whole different ball of wax for this document that's in front of me here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8757.643s">A</a> whole different ball of wax. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8759.184s">We</a> have a position that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8761.546s">The</a> cap was voted down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8764.048s">Individual</a> still continues to be compensated in that cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8767.711s">So</a> I think it's problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8769.112s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8770.333s">I</a> really think it's problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8771.514s">I</a> think that any position that's included in this document right here that doesn't have a cap should be eliminated from the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8781.982s">The</a> administration can come back <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8783.39s">just</a> like we talked about with the KP law item, with the supplemental spending package, that does it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8789.955s">Take</a> all the personalities out of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8792.197s">Take</a> all the personalities out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8794.278s">Let's</a> talk about process, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8796.18s">We</a> have an opinion from the city solicitor saying, this is how you're supposed to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8799.763s">We</a> have an opinion from the chief of staff saying, no, we should do it this way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8806.028s">That's</a> very, very encouraging to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8809.03s">So</a> at the end of the day, Mr. President, you know, I think that we're putting the, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8813.337s">before</a> the horse a lot of times here, and it might be better off for us as a body, in a cleaner, more transparent fashion, for us to have the classifications voted upon, and then the spending associated with those classifications come with us after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8829.128s">And</a> this is something I feel very strongly about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8832.49s">We've</a> always been talking about CAFs and classifications, and doing things the right way, making sure that employees that do jobs that are created and posted have to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8842.618s">These</a> jobs have to exist, and they don't exist if we don't update the CAF ordinance to reflect this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8847.341s">So</a> while there may be historical problems with the CAF ordinance, that doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be rectified now for the new jobs that are being created. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8854.725s">And</a> that's where I stand on this issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8857.027s">I</a> support an election-coordinated position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8858.488s">I</a> absolutely do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8859.508s">I</a> want to approve the CAF before I approve the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8861.93s">I</a> want to create the job before I fund the job that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8865.272s">That's</a> where I am on this issue with all the CAFs, all the classifications in this budget that don't exist by way of ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8871.255s">We're</a> funding money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8872.656s">to</a> a position that doesn't exist.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8890.063s">I</a> do believe I have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8892.664s">And</a> I do believe that if it hasn't been done right in the past, why are we gonna perpetuate that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8897.606s">Ultimately,</a> we have a number of positions that need to be created. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8899.967s">So</a> let's go through the process and create <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8902.629s">All</a> right, let's go through the process and create them properly, and then fund those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8906.332s">Let's</a> not throw money and fund them for jobs that don't exist, and then wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8910.015s">Because</a> we did that once before, and it didn't work out so well for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8913.118s">It</a> didn't work out so well for us to attune to $700 a week, all right, to an individual employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8918.363s">So,</a> you know, I'm looking at this, and I'm saying that there's a couple of situations and concerns that raises the concern to me with financial transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8925.429s">Number</a> one, financial transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8929.17s">The</a> positions haven't, there's been no ask to create the positions, nevermind funding, but there's a request to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8934.353s">Why</a> don't we create the positions first, then fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8936.394s">All</a> right, let's put the horse before the cart. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8939.516s">Because</a> there might be disputing about the caps and classifications that employees are being placed in, in these new positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8947.46s">So</a> I really think it needs to be looked at, and it needs to be looked at a little bit stronger and harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8951.703s">I</a> don't wanna stand in the way of taking a vote on a budget, Mr. President, but what I do wanna do is vote on a budget that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8956.055s">and</a> I wanna vote on a budget that complies with the legal advice that we've received from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8960.238s">And</a> I wanna make a vote on a budget that has some financial transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8965.341s">And</a> I think that's really what we need right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8967.283s">So</a> with the creation of all these, because no one's against moving the city forward, no one's against making progress, but we wanna do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8974.687s">And</a> the right way to do it is to present the CAF to this council first, to change the ordinance, to create a position, just like we did when we created Penny, the Substance Abuse Prevention Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8985.269s">How</a> do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8985.849s">I</a> remember how we did it, because I sat here and I took a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8989.072s">What</a> we did was we created the CAF first. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8991.213s">We</a> created the line item, we created the CAF, we created the classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8994.536s">We</a> sent that to the mayor, it came back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8996.698s">Then</a> the mayor came back and they funded the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8999.299s">We</a> can't fund positions that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9001.061s">It's</a> financially irresponsible.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9476.051s">Once</a> the budget is passed and the money's appropriated, uh, Alicia, once the money's passed, the budget is appropriated.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9496.711s">What</a> if the CAF's never come before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9498.172s">What</a> happens to that money?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9504.676s">Okay,</a> so it would just fall into free cash or free spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9507.397s">Or</a> you could use it prior to the year transfers, maybe?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9514.902s">So</a> ultimately we have about $620,000 worth of money that may or may not be on account for where it's going to be spent in the budget if these caps never come before.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9527.829s">What</a> if we never get them in July? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9529.129s">I'm</a> saying right now we're being asked to appropriate $620,000, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9533.152s">Well</a> over half a million dollars to fund positions that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9537.534s">What</a> if we fund them and then the positions never come before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9540.115s">What</a> if that money is now spent, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9548.358s">Right,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9550.278s">Things</a> happen though. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9550.979s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9551.459s">That's</a> what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9552.259s">That's</a> what I want to be sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9553.039s">I</a> think that we're going to, how can we spend 650,000 or $620,000 worth of money and not know if we're ever going to get the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9561.801s">Why</a> don't we get the paper, approve the paper and then fund the paper for the positions that it's bought? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9565.882s">I</a> mean, I just, I think that's what makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9568.402s">I</a> think that's what really makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9569.563s">There's</a> no guarantee we're ever going to get a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9571.338s">I</a> know that, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9572.399s">That</a> things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9573.239s">You</a> know, she gets, may get struck by lightning tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9575.681s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9576.341s">For</a> all we know, we never get the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9578.583s">You</a> know, but the $620,000, it's quite a chunk of change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9582.665s">So</a> it's not, it's not chump change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9584.667s">And</a> it's not something that I think anybody behind this rail is opposed to discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9588.869s">We</a> just want to have the conversation the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9591.171s">We</a> want to have the process done the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9592.852s">You</a> know, we could reduce the budget by the positions that don't have caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9596.664s">Take</a> a vote on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9597.684s">You</a> could bring that back to the supplemental spending paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9599.705s">We</a> can do this thing the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9601.085s">It's</a> about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9602.065s">It's</a> about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9603.065s">Maybe</a> that's really what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9604.826s">Do</a> I have a problem bringing parking in-house? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9607.466s">Not</a> particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9608.647s">Do</a> I have a problem appropriating $350,000 for jobs that don't exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9612.848s">Yeah,</a> big time, big time got a problem with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10064.894s">But-</a> I don't understand how creating an ordinance that establishes a classification scale for employees is a waste of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10074.836s">I</a> mean, ultimately- You're gonna cut it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10076.276s">It's</a> transparent, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10077.576s">So</a> you go and you create the classification, you create the cap, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10080.497s">That</a> gets approved by this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10082.097s">It</a> has to go through three readings just like anything else, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10085.708s">Okay,</a> it has to happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10088.429s">It</a> has to happen if you're creating a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10090.95s">So</a> I'm not feeling how this is a waste of time or a waste of anybody's energy or effort in presenting a proposal before us to have it done the right way, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10101.073s">The</a> budget's a spending bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10102.814s">That's</a> a whole different ball of wax. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10104.254s">The</a> creation of the position is the creation of the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10106.955s">There</a> could be things that come into play if you create a position where we don't have any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10111.077s">We</a> have to eliminate a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10112.277s">I</a> believe that before I got on the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10114.858s">you</a> led the charge to do such and take the Assistant Commissioner DPW's position out of the budget because of financial circumstances that have changed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10124.14s">So</a> that's always something that's gonna be on the table that this council might exercise its line item veto rights because that's the action that might be necessary to be taken in the best interest of the taxpayers in this community and in the best interest of financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10140.318s">So</a> to say that, you know, we're going to put in the budget first and you fund it because we don't want to come before you and then have you not approve the calf is strange to me, get the calf approved and then fund the spending bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10154.121s">That</a> is an operational manual for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10157.522s">I</a> mean, right now we have $620,000 being thrown against the wall for positions that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10162.603s">I</a> want to buy the iPhone 25 so that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10165.361s">I</a> want it so bad, but it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10167.422s">There</a> is no such thing as the iPhone 25, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10170.483s">So</a> it's just from a standpoint of financial responsibility as stewards of money in this community, as stewards of money in this community, how do we expend $620,000 for positions that don't exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10184.107s">It's</a> very, very, very hard for me to swallow, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10188.489s">It's</a> $620,000 positions that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10191.59s">They've</a> never been created. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10193.344s">We</a> have a commitment from the administration saying it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10196.005s">When</a> it happens is a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10197.545s">We're</a> going to fund this budget with all these positions that don't exist for a full 12-month period, for a full fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10202.807s">For</a> a full fiscal year, we're going to fund the position, but we never know when we're going to get the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10209.59s">We're</a> saying you get some of them in July, then we're going to do a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10213.371s">Let's</a> make this easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10214.391s">Let's</a> take them out, put it back on the administration to put the paper together, to come with us and do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10220.465s">I</a> think we all want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10221.305s">There's</a> some good things in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10222.306s">There's</a> a lot of good things in this budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10224.366s">A</a> lot of good things in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10225.847s">But</a> I, in my right mind, cannot sit here and support spending $620,000 on things that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10232.709s">They're</a> figments right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10233.469s">They're</a> just ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10234.629s">They're</a> just ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10235.47s">Until</a> we pass those classifications, they're just ideas.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10262.581s">It's</a> been pretty clarified what the level of respect is with this body.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10268.426s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10269.927s">I</a> mean, quite frankly, the argument wouldn't be the opposite, Mr. President, because we have a proven track record and the record doesn't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10276.504s">The</a> record shows we've always done the cap before we do the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10278.845s">All</a> right, we've always done the cap before we do the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10281.366s">Last</a> year, this whole director of HR position, yeah, that was a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10285.688s">We</a> never should have done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10286.709s">We</a> never should have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10287.989s">We</a> never should have done it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10289.79s">But</a> I remember amending the caps under the Burke administration and under the McGlynn administration well prior to being requested to funnel, well prior to being requested to funnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10301.035s">And</a> quite frankly, the argument wouldn't be the opposite because the record speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10306.39s">The</a> history is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10307.851s">The</a> history is there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10538.27s">It's</a> about me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10538.991s">It's</a> about the taxpayers and the taxpayer at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10540.631s">That's</a> all this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10541.732s">It's</a> not personal at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10543.155s">And</a> then that that's, that's what I'm not saying it's first I'm a little taken back by some comments, because not not by you, but in general, it's not personal at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10550.256s">It's</a> about being a financial steward and a fiscal steward in this community, and making sure that you know, having been involved in government for 20 years we know how things work right and we want to make sure that we do things the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10559.538s">And</a> that's all this is about Mr. Mr. President and for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10563.419s">Ultimately,</a> I think, no offense, you having a different opinion, a difference of opinion on this if you take a fence when you know <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10569.855s">it</a> becomes personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10570.595s">And</a> this isn't personal between you and me at all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10573.556s">And</a> this issue of spending is a personal matter, and I want that to be very clear.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10785.22s">I</a> have no problem doing that because I can't, in my right mind, support a budget that spends $620,000 of funds that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10795.667s">necessarily</a> going to a defined purpose without at least attempting, Mr. President, to offer a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10805.314s">So</a> the way I'd like to offer this motion, because I have all the line items, I have all the amounts and everything else, I'll offer the motion in a general format. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10812.46s">If</a> we have to go back and address it, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10814.662s">But</a> my motion would be to reduce the city budget in the dollar amount equivalent to that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10830.041s">appropriated</a> in the proposed fiscal year budget for the caps that don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10838.045s">It</a> comes to $216,000 in exchange, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10841.767s">I'm</a> sorry, what was the amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10846.97s">617,390.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10849.632s">I'll</a> offer that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10850.712s">If</a> we need to go to the line items after the fact, I'll be happy to pull those out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10854.695s">It</a> seems to me that there is not much of an appetite for this council to move in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10859.82s">However,</a> I'd be happy to offer the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10983.2s">There's</a> a motion on the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10985.502s">I</a> appreciate everybody's commentary and their willingness to act in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10988.984s">I</a> just would like to say that there is no guarantee that if this money gets appropriated, it's ever going to be used for what we're spending it for, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10999.151s">And</a> number two, you know, it is $617,390 that we're appropriating that right now has no defined purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11003.954s">The</a> jobs don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11004.715s">They</a> go to a place that doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11006.436s">So</a> with that being said, that's my argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11008.37s">for</a> this matter, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11073.247s">Have</a> you received the grant to conduct this study or is this a grant that we will have to apply for and competitively bid for?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11190.061s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11193.242s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13390.274s">I</a> have one question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13398.958s">I</a> do believe we asked a question from the city solicitor relative to putting several other boards and commissions under the scope and purview of the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13409.403s">Our</a> Office of Community Development was established by the acts in 1974, chapter 839. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13412.465s">And</a> we discussed that during the budget hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13418.199s">made</a> a request to the city solicitor as to whether or not this administration, not this administration, but the community is acting in accordance with the general law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13426.123s">When</a> we adopted that local option, it said that any type of order commission that falls under that office has to be voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13432.125s">So</a> I was wondering if we haven't received a response from the solicitor on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13438.548s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13709.654s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13712.755s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13713.075s">So</a> if I may, Mr. President, I too find many positives in this budget and I do have some very, very loud concerns that I've made very vocal this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13725.779s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, this isn't an issue about personalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13728.78s">It's</a> an issue about moving the city of Medford forward, what direction we want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13734.338s">I,</a> for one, have spent a lot of time and energy and effort this year focusing on being financially accountable and fiscally transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13741.983s">And</a> I don't think I'll be able to support the budget this evening because of that $620,000 appropriation that's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13746.625s">It's</a> not here for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13749.827s">I</a> also have some concerns about the investment that we're making in our highway department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13753.129s">We</a> only have 16 members of our highway department, up zero from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13758.96s">So</a> these are some concerns I think that, you know, when we talk about what we need to do to provide for our community and show that our tax dollars are going to the delivery of services, we need to invest in certain areas, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13769.327s">I</a> feel as though we're moving away from some of the areas that are necessary and being invested in, very basic areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13775.372s">So</a> with that being said, I will not be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13778.294s">I</a> do agree with Councilman Chalko. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13779.474s">I</a> think that the school budget increases are something that are very positive in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13785.625s">I</a> do believe there are very good things in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13787.607s">There</a> are some very good things in this budget, Mr. President, but I can't, in my right mind as a fiscal steward in this community, appropriate, you know, close to $620,000 for funds that I don't know where that would go.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13808.566s">That</a> Mr. President, coupled with <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13811.536s">Council</a> priority is being, you know, having a line item for legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13816.56s">I</a> think it's very important for us, you know, moving forward and being able to address the concerns that are brought to us and presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13823.444s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, for those reasons, I will be voting against the budget this week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14065.335s">May</a> I be so bold as to suggest Mr. President, whereas it seems as though we have a commitment to be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14072.248s">possibly</a> retain our own legal counsel going forward with this commitment to the administration, maybe we let the item lay on the table and we move forward discussing our options with our own legal counsel, should that be necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14083.732s">If</a> I may, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_k3Xg1illaRI/2024-11-19_k3Xg1illaRI.html">City Council 06-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=149.937s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=150.697s">So</a> would it be the solicitor's recommendation to go into executive session at this point in time, or would it be your recommendation to follow some sort of notification process? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=161.179s">I</a> noticed that, you know, there's nine other reasons why we could go in and maybe she could shed some light on whether or not this would fall into one of those other buckets of, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=172.23s">appropriate</a> authority.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=228.505s">The</a> motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by— So, in essence, then, what we're doing is tonight we're going to vote to go into executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=234.33s">We</a> have to wait 48 hours before we do that because of the individual rights?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=399.047s">I</a> mean, if the recommendations that we go into executive session, but that executive session happens, I'm just, I want to be in compliance with the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=406.073s">And</a> I don't want to turn this into an issue where there's an open meeting law complaint filed against the council when the nature and substance of the materials that the council received was so significant and important. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=418.263s">Um,</a> I don't want the, the underlying issue as to why we're trying to meet to be <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=426.162s">you</a> know, taken away from, to be distracted by an open meeting law complaint that may or may not be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=432.748s">I</a> know we've had our fair share of frivolous complaints in the past, but, you know, where it involves employee rights, I think we need to earn the side of caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=441.235s">If</a> that's the case, that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=443.578s">But,</a> you know, based on the fact that we did receive materials, <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=448.237s">that</a> were before us, can the solicitor maybe provide us with a little bit of guidance as to how we can discuss this information while still protecting the individual rights of the subjects of the complaint? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=460.586s">I</a> mean, is there a way we can even talk about it without invoking individual rights?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=486.89s">So,</a> if the council elected to go into executive session for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=491.133s">How</a> would the notification process take place would you be responsible for doing the notification with the city clerk be responsible
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=769.247s">So,</a> um, vice president, I don't think that this is that is saying we can't meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=775.197s">I</a> think what the solicitor is saying is that we can need, we just have to wait 48 hours to notify the- So respectfully, when did we ask for this meeting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=835.805s">So</a> what would the notification requirements be if we were to notify? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=839.807s">Does</a> that be certified mail, certified letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=841.508s">Does</a> it have to be hand-delivered? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=843.69s">What</a> would the process service requirement be?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=971.79s">So</a> ultimately the purpose of us to go into this executive session will be to discuss the complaint that we received and the individuals mentioned into it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=979.695s">That's</a> the purpose of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=981.156s">In</a> order for us to do that, because individuals are mentioned into it, individual rights would kick in. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=985.559s">So</a> because of that, we have to give 48 hours notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=988.997s">for</a> us to meet, and we have to notify those individuals that they're going to be discussed and give them the right to attend the meeting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=995.099s">Do</a> we have to give them the right to participate in the meeting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1001.06s">Hold</a> it in an open session if they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1002.841s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1003.541s">So,</a> going forward, right, I think we're all, we all want to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1008.902s">We</a> all want to have the meeting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1010.483s">We</a> have the city solicitor here saying that there's a process that we need to follow, so why don't we just <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1015.308s">follow</a> the process and get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1018.051s">So</a> the earliest we could meet will be Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1020.173s">That</a> sound correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1031.954s">Well,</a> I think the first thing we do would be we have the meeting to discuss the complaint and the individuals mentioned in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1037.615s">The</a> city solicitor will be there to provide us with what our obligations are now that we are informed of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1043.696s">And</a> if that means seek legal counsel on the outside, then that's what we'd be taking up the vote on that day, whether or not that's the direction we want to go in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1063.701s">So</a> then that might be right. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1064.802s">That</a> might be the vote that we have to take that on that Saturday on that at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1069.423s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1069.863s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1071.324s">What's</a> that? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1071.704s">What</a> are our obligations now that we have this?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1124.102s">I</a> mean, I think that's what we're looking for ultimately, legal guidance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1132.085s">I</a> think we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1132.706s">I</a> mean, I'm looking at it as we did get the legal guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1134.707s">The</a> legal guidance we got was don't go into executive session because you didn't notify the people because individual rights kicks in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1145.484s">Right,</a> and guides us with the process to get the meeting so that we can move to that goal of getting the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1151.267s">You</a> know, and we have to go through the process, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1534.311s">We</a> seem to be an uncharted waters here yet certain one aspect of the complaints would surround personnel issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1540.853s">Another</a> aspect of the complaint surrounds financial issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1544.234s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1552.301s">The</a> financial issue, I think, is something that certainly warrants investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1557.324s">And</a> my request would be, through you, what steps do we have or rights do we have as a council to further investigate that matter where it's not a personnel issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1574.554s">It's</a> an administration, a government issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1636.227s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1638.718s">When</a> an allegation is raised of financial impropriety, and it's brought to the attention of the council, what obligations legally does the council have in terms of action?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1659.703s">I</a> mean, we can't not act, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1661.164s">So</a> something's been brought to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1663.624s">It's</a> well documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1666.153s">balls</a> are not going to do something right where they're going to be complicit and the information received and do nothing with it or we're going to look at it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1674.779s">So</a> how do we do that how do we look at what how do we go about doing that as for this appropriation we're still not going to be able to be in a private session right. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1682.545s">I</a> mean it still has to go through the an executive session still needs to go through that individual rights process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1812.967s">But</a> on that point, Mr. President, I think it's, you know, the complainant's right if they want to pursue it through an outside agency that they can file a complaint there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1820.008s">I</a> don't think it's the council's obligation to file a complaint for, you know, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1825.089s">If</a> there's an individual that's mentioned in the complaint, I think, you know, the materials that were before us kind of spoke a little bit about pursuing outside agency investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1832.671s">It</a> didn't necessarily <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1834.63s">indicate</a> that that was the next steps that the individuals were going to take in these complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1839.491s">But,</a> you know, I think we're going down, maybe not us, but me, I'm going down a slippery slope with individuals and this and that and the other thing in the complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1847.794s">So</a> with that being said, I'm going to rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1850.195s">I</a> certainly would like to convene an executive session to discuss this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1853.636s">I</a> certainly feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1855.787s">If</a> it takes us – have it to give a 48-hour notice, then that's what we have to do to go forward and continue with this discussion that we need to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1862.874s">If</a> that's the process, that's the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1866.017s">It</a> is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1866.537s">That's</a> the world we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1868.179s">So</a> I'm certainly open to moving forward in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1873.624s">But</a> I don't know what anybody else feels on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1876.707s">I</a> don't want to take any action that's going to effectuate <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1883.432s">impact</a> individual's rights here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1885.873s">I'd</a> rather err on the side of caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1887.294s">These</a> are public employees that do have rights, and, you know, we have to make sure we respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=1891.737s">So</a> if it just takes 48 hours and a letter of notification, I don't see what harm that causes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2202.183s">Mr.</a> President, should the council elect to hire outside legal representation for the purpose of investing a potential criminal matter, what obligations would the administration have to cooperate with this person? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2219.134s">I</a> mean, other than providing documents that are under the over-meeting law, what other requirements would they have to participate in any type of investigation where <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2231.44s">it</a> would be the same as an investigation because we're a public entity in a public body, you know, they're required to participate in this investigation that's been initiated by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2240.765s">We're</a> with the legislative body.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2252.572s">You</a> know, say the council hired an attorney to go and investigate and the attorney wanted to talk to somebody and the person in the city hall said, I'm not talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2260.643s">No,</a> you have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2261.283s">No,</a> I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2261.744s">I'm</a> not talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2263.205s">They're</a> not compelled. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2265.006s">Are</a> they compelled to participate in any way, shape or form?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2623.472s">Well.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2624.233s">Information</a> is present isn't isn't the open meeting what the requirements also around notice notice only. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2630.918s">It's</a> we need to notify you that we're talking about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2632.94s">If</a> you want to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2634.883s">Come,</a> if you don't, don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2636.203s">If</a> you can't be there, you're not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2637.643s">But</a> I don't see why we'd be beholden to their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2642.204s">We're</a> saying, we're giving you the $40 notices provided in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2646.265s">The</a> law says we have to give you the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2647.605s">That's</a> all we have to do is give you the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2648.905s">If</a> you want to come, come. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2650.266s">If</a> you don't, don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2651.426s">Reach</a> out if you can't make it and tell us you want to reschedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2654.186s">But</a> I don't think you can just ignore it and just wait for it to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2658.707s">I</a> don't think that that's an option.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2663.148s">Well,</a> I mean, the open meeting law is really about notice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2665.85s">That's</a> really what it surrounds is what's it's about, you know, what needs to be posted in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2727.381s">I</a> mean, I don't know how we'd be able to identify who gets, so who do we, how can we right now determine who even gets notified to come to the thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2735.123s">You</a> can't, I can't speak about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2736.623s">We</a> can't name names, how does that work? <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2742.104s">We</a> need a lawyer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2754.978s">I'd</a> like to offer a motion then that when the clerk does provide notification of the meeting, that I notify everybody who's mentioned by name in the documents.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2850.383s">I'd</a> also like to further end the amendment, Mr. President, with addition to legal counsel, outside financial audit might be appropriate as well, whether or not there's a public account of some sort that we could also take a look at related to the finance aspect of the complaint.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/k3Xg1illaRI&t=2953.127s">Yes.</a>

Begging plead for him not to eliminate the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3766.652s">So</a> it'll be a keep lacrosse program alive for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3769.386s">And,</a> you know, we still have that program today. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3771.827s">And</a> it was because of Buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3773.408s">Buddy,</a> listen, listen to the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3776.31s">Tried</a> to provide a service, but he was a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3778.291s">He</a> was a great coach, Baldwin Catholic High School, Hall of Famer, Manfred High School, Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3784.614s">Someone</a> who always spoke about the blue and white, but it was always a little secret that he kept that he was actually a Baldwin Catholic graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3790.897s">You</a> know, his sister, Patricia and Brenna Deck, the twins, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3795.326s">very</a> close friends of the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3796.526s">And</a> I just want to offer them my condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3798.967s">It</a> was a very tough, tough way to go this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3802.248s">And</a> I stand by my council colleagues and in all the time words that they have about Mr. Kelly, because every single one of them is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3810.049s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3811.23s">Senior</a> Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4465.013s">Questions</a> for the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4466.894s">Mr.</a> President, I actually had the opportunity of speaking with Mr. Tallman earlier, having some familiarity with the ongoings at Hormel Stadium in the rental of the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4476.418s">The</a> history of Ultimate Frisbee in Medford is actually pretty strong and pretty proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4482.341s">Just</a> a couple of years ago, I do remember the Boston Whitecaps, I think was the name of the team that was competing in the national championship and were actually on ESPN's top 10 at Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4493.747s">So</a> they certainly do bring some interest to the area and certainly some bodies to the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4499.151s">And</a> I, for one, have no concerns supporting the Sausage Guys, Sausage Cat down at Hormel Stadium for these dates that have been selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4507.979s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would move for approval on item one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4512.523s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4711.982s">Okay,</a> question to the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4716.565s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4719.468s">I'm</a> not understanding this, so would it be located at the physical location of the store, just outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4726.473s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4761.691s">Do</a> you have an existing drive-through window at this location presently?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4771.326s">So</a> I get the people to go inside the restaurant to go to the drive-thru.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4777.249s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5161.581s">Vice</a> President Knight, I'm somewhat in line with what Councilor Bears is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5165.562s">I</a> mean, I just don't like the precedent it sets, and I don't really feel as though it <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5171.668s">falls</a> in line with the intent of a food truck pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5174.41s">You</a> know, we were talking about food trucks, we were talking about, you know, having the ability to, you know, bring the sausage guy to Hormel Stadium so that someone could have an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5182.294s">And</a> I really think that, you know, remodeling the business, that's a cost of doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5186.197s">And</a> I think that the public safety concerns are going to outweigh, you know, the benefits that they're going to provide to the community, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5193.121s">And</a> number two, because it doesn't seem to really fall in line with the intent of our food truck ordinance, I'm going to have a difficult time supporting it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5200.666s">Thank</a> you, Vice President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=698.726s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=699.966s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=701.587s">First</a> of all, Kelly, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=704.488s">Although</a> I didn't have the opportunity to be on the board of the North Method Little League or watch him play with football in the backyard with your grandfather, I did have the opportunity to watch him coach my son in T-ball last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=714.896s">And</a> you did a hell of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=716.596s">The</a> Orioles were the best t-ball team in Medford Little League last year because of Kelly and her mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=721.117s">So</a> let me tell you, we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=722.437s">We</a> had a great year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=723.037s">We</a> had a great season. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=724.538s">But</a> it's very flattering and quite humbling to see someone at such a young age pursue something that they love against all odds and be so successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=733.699s">And</a> really, Kelly, this is a great achievement that you should be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=736.18s">And</a> I just want to say congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=739.28s">And</a> we hope to have you back on the t-ball field next year coaching.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1922.097s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1924.26s">I</a> think we'd be remiss in not pointing out the hard work and dedication that our friends at American Legion Post 45 have put forth year after year to ensure that the city of Medford is in compliance with General Logan's order. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1935.494s">This</a> year was the <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1937.897s">the</a> first time we were able to convene since the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1940.098s">And</a> this is one of my favorite events that we have every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1942.78s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we point out the hard work that our friends at The Post do. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1947.323s">And</a> also a familiar face that was missing this year, John Granara, someone who has led the charge in ensuring that these graves get decorated annually, was someone that used to run our annual Memorial Day ceremonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1961.372s">He's</a> had some health issues that have rendered him unable to participate in the way that he used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1966.897s">When</a> I went out to decorate flags with my family, Mr. President, the first person I saw there working out of the trunk of his car was John Granara with a set of maps. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1974.787s">a</a> list of names, who the people were, where they're supposed to go, how many graves they're going to be decorating, how much time it's going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1980.629s">He'd</a> have chaperones and proctors there to make sure that the work was getting done correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1984.73s">Um,</a> even a small little training, uh, before he allowed people to go out to, uh, to, to put flags on veterans graves, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1991.091s">Um,</a> so I think it's very important that we point out the work that our friends, uh, have done over there at post 45, um, anytime <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=1997.187s">that</a> the city of Medford calls on them, they're there to deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2000.229s">If</a> we remember back just a couple of years ago, we weren't able to have the local elections at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2006.072s">And</a> the first people to step up were our friends at American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2009.934s">The</a> veterans in this community are very active, and they deserve to be remembered, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2013.616s">And</a> in that regard, I invite here this evening our Veterans Service Director, Mike Durham, to say a few words on behalf of the Memorial Day ceremonies and the efforts that went into getting the city prepared and the cemetery prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2025.981s">for</a> that event. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2026.602s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case and thank my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2029.924s">I'd</a> ask them to support the resolution and also offer Mr. Durham an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2034.067s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2035.749s">Good</a> evening, Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2036.249s">Name</a> and address of the record, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2456.836s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2458.837s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2459.977s">Mr.</a> President, if we look at our packets this evening under suspension, there's also paper 21405, recognizing June 6th as the anniversary of D-Day and requesting that this evening's meeting be dedicated to the honor of our World War II veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=2473.541s">And</a> I just ask that these two papers be combined.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4118.446s">Point</a> of information on that, Mr. President as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4120.966s">Mr.</a> President, when we voted to repurpose Riverside Plaza, one of the things we did was we turned Riverside Plaza into a parkland. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4128.028s">And</a> the reason we turned Riverside Plaza into a parkland was so that we had the opportunity to permit it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4135.269s">So</a> I think this could be something that's as simple as being taken care of with a permit as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4296.764s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend Councilor Caraviello's recommendation also to request that the <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4303.196s">Recreation</a> Department apply for a determination of eligibility grant from the Community Preservation Committee to see if there's a funding mechanism available there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4313.942s">Every</a> so often, we have the ability to apply to determine if we're eligible for certain projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4318.925s">And</a> this might be either through the Chess Club or through the Recreation Department or in partnership, file a joint application with the Community Preservation Commission and see if you're eligible for funds through that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4337.901s">Well,</a> no, I mean, it's just an application to see if the city would perform the project per se, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4342.725s">And</a> you guys could propose the project in partnership with the recreation department. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4347.248s">The</a> recreation department would be the one that promotes the plan and then the oversight and stuff would be handled through. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4352.452s">whoever</a> the project manager is that gets assigned to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4355.713s">I</a> don't think this is going to be something that's overly expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4358.534s">I</a> mean, you know, a couple of tables and a tent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4360.275s">I</a> don't think we're looking for rocket science over here to make sure the water works. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4362.976s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4364.316s">So</a> if the funding is a problem, I know we got a lot of money coming in from this ARAPA that they're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4369.858s">Maybe</a> that money can be used for that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4371.819s">But</a> I think that, you know, the community preservation grant would be a great opportunity for you to <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4377.038s">plant</a> a seed and then build upon it, let it grow, water it, because if it works once, it's going to work twice in a different location, work a third time in a fourth location. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4384.164s">So</a> I think it might be worth pursuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4386.386s">So</a> with that being said, I'd just like to add that as an amendment to the council's recommendation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4827.946s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4829.428s">For</a> those of us who know Mr. Skoper, he was a retired city employee from the city of Medford, a longtime Medford resident, very active in both our community and in politics, Mr. President, and was a devout supporter of President Emeritus. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4843.626s">Robert</a> Amiako, I can remember standing at the Columbus School holding a sign with Mr. Scopa on one of the coldest days. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4849.727s">He</a> must have been 80 years old and he was there from the minute the polls opened until the minute the polls closed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4856.268s">An</a> unbelievable campaigner, just an all-around good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4859.429s">And</a> he's going to be sadly missed in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4861.229s">He</a> was someone who put his money where his mouth and wasn't afraid to go volunteer, was someone that would go out there and get behind the candidate that he loved and supported as opposed to crying and complaining on the internet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4870.072s">He</a> was a throwback to the old days and just a good person, Mr. President, that dedicated a lot of his life to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=4874.769s">So</a> I ask that he be remembered this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5334.381s">On</a> this piece with the state legislation, are we aware if there's any funding attached to this or if this is going to be an unfunded mandate that will go through the legislature?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5358.879s">May</a> it be so bold as to make the suggestion that we send this to a director of community media to come up with maybe a cost estimate as to what this will cost to retrofit these rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5367.646s">If</a> we're really serious about it, we got to know what it costs before we go any further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5371.409s">Find</a> out what it costs, put out an RFP or something, you know, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5374.691s">So</a> you want to amend that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5375.932s">I</a> mean, I think that that's probably the, if we want it to happen, that's probably the way to go about it, in my opinion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5452.482s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5453.122s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I know that there are certain criteria outlined in the open meeting law relative to remote participation that, you know, may need to <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=5463.923s">be</a> looked at by our boards and commissions should they wish to adopt this measure in the form of probably a training because I know that there are certain steps that need to be taken by the public body in order to authorize such should the state legislation not pass.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7044.5s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7047.807s">Growing</a> up in the area, I grew up on Whitman Road, Essex Street, Winthrop Street, Essex Street, Whitman Road, Woburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7054.709s">There</a> we are, two streets away from Woburn Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7057.929s">I</a> was looking at the number of signs that go, it almost looks like Yale Street, High Street right now, they got so many signs on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7065.131s">But</a> ultimately, Mr. President, if I were driving home from Medford Square, and I lived on Hastings Lane, Austin Road, Walcott Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7075.82s">Well,</a> Mystic Street, how do I get home? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7077.801s">I</a> can't take a left turn down any of those streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7080.843s">So</a> the answer would be, well, go down to the Parkway and then turn up from the Parkway onto the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7089.008s">But</a> Hastings Lane has restrictions on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7092.591s">Mystic</a> Streets, you do not enter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7093.932s">You</a> have to go down to Auburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7096.033s">You'd</a> have to go all the way down to Auburn Street, all the way down to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7099.075s">Does</a> this make any sense to divert traffic from people that live in the neighborhood to go all the way down to the school, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7103.858s">Number</a> two, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7106.029s">We</a> are seeing the changes that we made at the South and Main intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7111.33s">We</a> are seeing now these changes along High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7113.551s">We</a> have a significant problem with Route 16, the light timing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7117.352s">So</a> every single morning, every single morning, the stretch of Winthrop Street between the Parkway and High Street backs up almost all the way to Lawrence Road, sometimes past it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7129.115s">On</a> the other side, it backs up almost all the way to the Woburn Street split, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7135.617s">looking</a> at these changes that we're making to traffic patents, we need, we need, we have to study the impact that it has after the fact, because quite frankly, the light changing cycle on route 16 is not fast enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7148.932s">to,</a> it doesn't happen frequent enough, to promote the steady flow of traffic through that intersection, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7153.814s">So</a> what you see is someone driving down Winthrop Street, and they get to the Winthrop Street Rotary, and they say, well, I'm not gonna make the light, but I'm not gonna sit here either, so let me pull up and block the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7165.6s">Or</a> you see someone coming down High Street that doesn't wanna turn down Winthrop Street and keep going Winthrop Street to Tufts University, they wanna go onto Winthrop Street and then turn left onto Route 16 to get on the highway. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7176.105s">But</a> what happens is, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7177.326s">The</a> current high street blocks the passing traffic lane, so nobody from Winthrop Street can go straight down Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7182.789s">It's</a> a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7183.509s">It's</a> an absolute traffic nightmare, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7185.85s">I</a> don't want to get into the last 10 years of traffic nightmares that the people in this area have had to deal with due to the simple fact that we've had construction going on between the Craddock Bridge, the Winthrop Street replacement, and the other source project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7197.795s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm glad we have 12 on the phone because I'd like to see what the plan is in terms of looking at the timing of the light cycles throughout this whole stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7207.458s">I</a> mean, ultimately we make these changes, but then there's never any follow-up in terms of what impact it has on the traffic flow as a whole in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7215.881s">You</a> know, for a very long time, we've been making knee-jerk reaction responses to the traffic situations in this community, but to put a no left-hand turn sign on the five streets coming up High Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7227.512s">Those</a> streets, all the people that live on them, it's crazy to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7230.453s">You're</a> one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7231.213s">You're</a> one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7233.594s">So</a> with that being said, Doug, maybe you can shed some light on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7237.015s">I</a> might appreciate it if you could. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7238.595s">But</a> I definitely think that we need to perform some type of traffic study to look at the impact that these changes have made, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7246.878s">And</a> number two, figure out a way that we can lessen them so that people in the area that have to get places can move down the roadway and not be trapped through an unpassable situation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7286.087s">So</a> point of no return, which is different than do not enter because we may have Burke put those signs up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7320.45s">To</a> do not enter is one thing, but the no left turn is another. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7323.39s">Because</a> when Mayor Burke erected those resident only signs, there was a lot of discussion about who's considered a resident and who isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7330.292s">And</a> that was addressed and discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7332.432s">Same</a> thing when it happened up at Jim's Market, when they put those signs up, that was addressed and discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7336.073s">And</a> it was residents are residents, residents can go down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7339.014s">Now,</a> you can't even take a left turn as a resident on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7342.754s">Nevermind</a> a resident in the city, a resident on the street to go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7345.962s">So</a> I think that that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7347.405s">And</a> quite frankly, I've spoken with people that live in the neighborhood, not Councilor Caballero actually, but I've spoken with people on Hastings land, I've spoken with people on Austin road, I've spoken with people on Walcott street, and all of them say the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7358.282s">How</a> am I supposed to get home?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7380.897s">What's</a> the solution, I guess is the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7383.238s">That's</a> all well and good, but what's the solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7385.359s">None</a> of these residents have been contacted about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7389.26s">All</a> of a sudden, they're just getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7391.783s">So</a> what's the solution? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7393.044s">Can</a> the science come down?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7414.713s">So</a> in essence it sounds like we sold our soul for this million dollars and we have no control of what's going to happen on the roadways that we <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7420.948s">that</a> these residents live on?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7480.336s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, what I see happening is people are going to come up High Street, and they're going to get to the fork in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7487.298s">And</a> they're going to say, all right, I can shoot down moving street now, and then I can catch the top half of Walcott, and then I can shoot across High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7498.022s">Because</a> going straight across isn't a left turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7500.622s">So</a> now what we're doing is we're diverting <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7502.854s">traffic</a> into the residential neighborhood, as opposed to keeping it on the main state controlled trucking route.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7576.895s">What</a> information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7577.636s">What</a> information, Councilor Maitland? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7579.478s">Is</a> that considered a reduction in service? <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7582.241s">The</a> removal of a stop for the DOT, for the MBTA.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=7651.488s">I</a> understand that, but does that correlate to what would be considered a reduction in service?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8465.081s">Thank</a> you for your clarification.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8571.785s">Vice</a> President, I just ask that we also simultaneously send this paper to the city solicitor and ask her to provide us with an amendment that would outline the creation or establishment of term limits for members of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8600.678s">We</a> can do it simultaneously. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8601.978s">It's</a> going to come back to us anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8603.819s">So</a> I'd like to have a, cause we're going to have to open up a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8606.62s">So</a> I'd like to have the paperwork from the city solicitor when it's time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SxgiOOMwDHY&t=8691.062s">We</a> have the remainder of the reading, whereas we have budget hearing scheduled for Wednesday and Saturday.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1026.858s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1029.895s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1030.856s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1032.817s">Thinking</a> back to when Infinity was before us, I do believe that some neighborhood residents appeared at that meeting and they expressed some concern over the use of an outdoor intercom system that was being used prior to Herb Chambers taking over. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1047.425s">And</a> I do believe that this council had placed restrictions on the permit for Infinity, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1056.052s">I'm</a> doing my best to try to dig those up, but I'm hoping that we can apply those same restrictions that were in place that the neighborhood asked for previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1063.854s">I</a> know that this lot has been vacant for some period of time, but when it was changing hands, a number of residents did come out expressing some concern over the use of the outdoor intercom system to, you know, call people and say, you know, Joe, you got a phone call, come inside and that type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1080.699s">It</a> was very disruptive to the neighborhood, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1083.02s">Number</a> two, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1085.029s">vehicles</a> stationed on site, or are they stored in another location in Mystic Ave, and are they going to be trucking back and forth to other locations around the possible Mystic Ave, or are they all going to be stored on site?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1112.704s">But</a> yeah, the local residents did want that protection in place when we issued the permit in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1119.089s">And</a> I'd ask that those restrictions be applied once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1122.951s">But</a> we're gonna have to find them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1125.533s">The</a> meeting minutes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1140.133s">I'd</a> like to offer it as a condition that, you know, the same conditions that were applied by this council when the Xfinity dealership received their class two license be applied to the special permit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1153.381s">Okay,</a> on the motion by... Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1157.723s">I</a> don't know how comfortable people are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1159.304s">We</a> can't see them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1176.478s">Is</a> that the only I think I think that was the only one we had last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1179.481s">Let's</a> put it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1180.302s">I</a> know I sponsored that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1181.583s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1181.823s">So</a> I know that that was the condition that was the only one I put on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1184.106s">I</a> don't know if other counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1184.987s">I</a> think that was the only one that was on there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1195.864s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1245.257s">Thinking</a> back, Mr. President, I do think the other restrictions that we put on it were the license goes with the business and not the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1251.842s">You</a> know, the usual restriction protections that we usually put in place, but I'm not 100% sure, but I think that that's what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1257.166s">The</a> license goes with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1259.748s">The</a> license goes with the business, not the address.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1609.874s">So</a> I think I was, I think last time this came up, it was because they had to build it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1617.175s">They</a> hadn't built it yet because they wanted to get the permits to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1620.255s">And</a> then they were going to build it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1621.196s">Then</a> they were going to come and inspect it after it was built. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1623.836s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1624.556s">Maybe</a> John can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's minus thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1627.517s">There's</a> going to be new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=1629.012s">it</a> hasn't been constructed yet because we need the permits to build it.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4177.203s">When</a> I saw this on the agenda, it sparked my interest and I did a little bit of snooping around. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4182.165s">And</a> what I've been able to determine is the president is that this position been vacant since March of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4187.708s">That's</a> 15 months that this position been vacant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4191.05s">Now</a> let's think back to my last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4194.095s">O'Connor</a> might be able to do it for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4195.396s">She</a> gave us a great rundown of what's happened since March of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4198.577s">So</a> since March of last year, we have not had a sealer of weights and measures in this community to protect consumers from price gouging, to protect consumers from greed, to protect consumers from operators that aren't doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4212.322s">And</a> when you think about what the sealer of weights and measures does, it's not only at the gas station, it's when you put your food on the scale at the supermarket, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4219.412s">So</a> this is a serious issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4221.233s">This</a> is a very serious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4222.333s">This</a> position should have been filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4223.474s">It's</a> budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4224.614s">It's</a> budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4225.034s">It</a> should have been filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4225.795s">We</a> have an ordinance for it, but it's being paid by a stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4230.577s">To</a> who? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4231.557s">Does</a> anybody know? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4233.118s">Nobody</a> knows, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4234.939s">It's</a> another example of transparency at its finest.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4329.958s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4331.419s">Councilor</a> Knox is exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4333.08s">This</a> is a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4334.401s">It's</a> such an important position that there's actually a state agency that oversees it, the Division of Standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4338.725s">It's</a> such an important position that sealers of weights and measures are mandated in communities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4343.187s">So</a> this isn't just the job that, you know, the council wants and we can't have, this is something that we need to keep our residents safe and to keep our consumers protected.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4910.52s">Um,</a> Mr. President, um, March 1st, I reached out to, uh, my superintendent of lights and lines, Mr. Steven Randazzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4920.145s">And</a> I made a request of him to remove the double pole located at three, five, seven, uh, double pole number three, five, seven, seven located at the corner of Greenleaf Avenue in Burgett Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4931.271s">And,</a> uh, after reviewing the location, Mr. Randazzo reported back to me, there was no city owned utilities that are on that pole that need to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4940.895s">As</a> such, it will be on the utility companies to get this double pole removed, and he referred to both Verizon and National Grid, and he put a request in for that work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4950.139s">To</a> date, this work has not been performed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4952.58s">I</a> would ask that this paper be tabled until such time as the double pole, located on the corner of Burgin Ave and Greenleaf Ave, be removed and replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=4959.423s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5160.603s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5161.563s">Mr.</a> President, I would like to offer a motion to refer this matter to a committee of the whole so that the council can be able to properly vet the neighborhood infrastructure and financial impacts and aspects of this loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5171.627s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5172.307s">Councilor</a> Powell.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5371.342s">If</a> you could, I'm sorry, the council does have a section of the budget where we discussed that service and we could also probably do this in that at the same time with a council to one stone as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5384.627s">So</a> if you could have the appropriate questions answered, we appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5505.214s">It</a> says referred to KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5511.247s">Is</a> there a number? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5511.807s">So</a> apparently they don't know, we have to talk to KP Law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5539.888s">I</a> don't know where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5542.771s">So</a> the, the Councilor asked about the 40, the 40 B projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5546.294s">And</a> we did get a response this evening for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5549.297s">It</a> says that it's referred to KP law for an update to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5552.499s">So</a> we asked the administration to give us an update and they sent it to outside council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5557.784s">Um,</a> but then I think there's another paper that was also out there and it was how much money we pay an outside council to do the type of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5565.179s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5565.459s">And</a> I don't think we've gotten that response either. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5568.2s">I</a> think I was confused when you talked about the 40 Bs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5570.781s">I</a> thought you were talking about the 40 Bs, not the other four or five papers that the council had passed requesting how much money that we've been spending.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5607.959s">There's</a> 365 to choose from. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5609.24s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5755.658s">On</a> that point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5757.119s">Vice</a> President Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5758.85s">This</a> isn't the first time that the councils had to use the tools of the Freedom of Information Act in order to obtain information from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5767.154s">And</a> I find it curious that every time the information that we're looking for surrounds the Kopelman and Page law firm, that we have to go down this road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5776.218s">Just</a> maybe a year or so ago, I put a resolution on asking for copies of the Warren articles each month. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5783.422s">We</a> have a big financial responsibility here in this community to approve a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5786.785s">Once</a> we approve the budget, are we done with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5788.646s">No,</a> absolutely not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5789.447s">We</a> should know where that money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5791.028s">And</a> that's what the Warren article says. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5792.79s">It's</a> an actual document that shows us where the money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5797.433s">We</a> had to fight for that document, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5799.575s">And</a> we didn't get it until, I think, January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5802.377s">We</a> got eight months worth of Warren articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5804.659s">After</a> begging and pleading and crying for it, we didn't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5807.361s">We</a> filed the freedom of information request and we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5812.317s">I</a> believe then we had some questions concerning payment of claims over $2,500 out of the legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5819.559s">And</a> we couldn't get any answers surrounding those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5822.28s">So</a> I'm a little confused as to why there's so much secrecy and such a veil of secrecy surrounding KP law and their operations here in the city and the role that they play here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5832.722s">Cause</a> I'm very confused by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5834.223s">When</a> we asked the city solicitor for opinion, they said they sent it to KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5837.224s">That's</a> not what we asked you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5839.124s">A</a> city ordinance is very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5840.765s">The</a> city solicitor gives the opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5842.783s">That's</a> what controls and dictates. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5844.244s">She's</a> the only one that has the legal authority to do such, not KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5848.145s">So</a> when KP Law offers an opinion, it's not even worth the paper it's written on because they don't have the statutory authority to write it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5854.308s">So</a> I'm very confused as to what's going on, Mr. President, with the administration in terms of this lack of transparency when it comes to spending and fiscal accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5863.671s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5864.852s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5912.751s">The</a> use variance that the council is talking about to do with the Titan gas station property, not 61 Locust Street Inn. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5919.834s">The</a> speaker keeps saying we, we, we, and I'm wondering if who's we, is she an employee of the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5925.096s">Is</a> she on a board or a commission for the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5926.876s">Or</a> does she practice some sort of official government role?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5972.11s">Vice</a> President Knight, that's not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5973.771s">This</a> council remedied that misclarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5976.774s">The</a> city solicitor put out an opinion saying that it was a Scribner's error, that these variances were allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5982.079s">And</a> then this council went and took a vote and adopted the city solicitor's opinion and corrected the Scribner's error. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5986.363s">And</a> that was well before this administration took place and well before this administration appointed the alternate that made the decision as chairman on the Titans gas station project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JjIkY7Z2rzw&t=5994.993s">Point</a> of information.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE/2024-11-19_7dpVBOZN8pE.html">City Council 05-25-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2286.379s">Paper</a> 21383 offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=2305.3s">be</a> it resolved the city administration requests Eversource as part of their underground utility project, install new sidewalk and curbing on the even side of Winthrop Street from Wildwood Road to Placedead Road in the interest of public safety.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3427.687s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3428.988s">And</a> I thank Councilor Marks for giving us a great history on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3432.65s">But</a> I think it's important that we also look back and think about what's been going on in this stretch for the better part of a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3441.135s">We</a> had an underground utility project going on there from the MWRA that went up Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3447.039s">That</a> took about three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3449.16s">And</a> part of that project included some work that went underneath the Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3454.263s">And</a> when they restored the Rotary, they restored it improperly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3457.59s">So</a> part of the mitigation of this project is actually, Eberstrom is fixing the project, fixing the mistake that the MWI made in the restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3466.476s">So</a> for two and a half years, that stretch was under construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3472.3s">Then</a> once that project, that underground, that water project finished, what happened was this little project over here, they call it the Craddock Bridge project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3482.747s">Three</a> years, Mr. President, where all the traffic that was supposed to go over that bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3487.489s">was</a> detoured up Winthrop Street to Winthrop Street Rotary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3492.252s">I</a> swear the day the Craddock Bridge project ended, the day, that's when they started this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3498.115s">This</a> stretch of road has been under construction or under part of a traffic management plan in one way, shape or form for the better part of 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3506.52s">10</a> years, Mr. President, that's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3509.841s">That's</a> not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3511.202s">So</a> this should be a project that should have been completed by now <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3515.367s">when</a> they sold us the bill of goods, when we granted the locations, they said it will be completed by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3520.731s">So</a> I share Councilor Mack's frustration with the process and with what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3526.856s">I</a> also have a question for the city engineer because it's been brought up that all our roadways are gonna be restored curb to curb and that we're gonna prioritize the curb to curb resurfacing of Mystic Gap, if I understood that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3537.944s">Am</a> I correct with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3538.965s">That</a> Mystic Gap will be resurfaced curb to curb as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3541.867s">So</a> they say, I just drove down Mystic Gap and it looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3545.033s">The</a> paint truck exploded and we have a whole brand new lane painted red all the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3551.734s">Mr.</a> Gabb going southbound into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3554.355s">So</a> what's going to happen with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3556.195s">If</a> the roadway is going to be resurfaced curb to curb, and it's going to be restored in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3561.916s">I'm</a> confused by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3563.937s">Is</a> there any coordination going on between these projects at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3567.057s">I</a> mean, can the city engineer answer that question for me, please address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3571.008s">You</a> know, we just spent an inordinate amount of money that I believe Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3575.551s">Barber</a> was able to secure in the state budget for this transportation initiative on Mystic Gap, and they implemented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3582.835s">But</a> they implemented it without coordinating the resurfacing of the roadway, which is something that I anticipate will happen towards the conclusion of this Eversource project if we don't get our ducks in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3595.603s">So</a> I'm hoping the city engineer can speak on that a little bit, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3665.03s">Well,</a> if the goal is to fast track that stretch, then how are they going to be able to gauge whether or not the pilot project works? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3671.734s">I</a> mean, if we get the green light to fast track that stretch repaving because that work is done in that roadway, how long are they going to be able to examine the data from this pilot project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3713.661s">And</a> I just see it as extremely wasteful that they put the paint down on the road, knowing that it's going to be milled and resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=3721.925s">And</a> then who's responsible for restoring it back to the in-kind situation, it will be National Grid, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5126.23s">I</a> do believe Councilor Scott Villanueva offered an amendment as well that wasn't drafted up at the on-site meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5132.373s">Would</a> I be happy to second that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5678.081s">As</a> amended by, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5681.728s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5682.569s">As</a> I go through my paperwork here, Mr. President, you know, I have a document dated April 30th, 2015, the Mystic to Woburn transmission project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5691.776s">I</a> have a document here, the Mystic to Woburn 115 kilovolt line project, Medford City Council presentation dated May 19th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5698.962s">I</a> have the same document dated October 20th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5705.427s">Another</a> presentation, November 14th, 2017, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5709.264s">And</a> another presentation is the present February 4th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5712.566s">I</a> think it's time we bring them back for another presentation as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5716.849s">Let's</a> get everybody in the same room here as well as onsite. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5720.652s">So</a> that everybody that has something to say can participate and can express their concerns with the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5724.575s">I'd</a> like to offer that as a formal motion that just as they have previously, I was supposed to pay before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=5729.698s">Last</a> time they were here was February 4th, 2020.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6027.474s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6029.503s">I</a> also think it's important to take a look and see if we're contributing the decisions of the administration and contributing to delays by not allowing more crews out on the roadways and not taking some steps to address it dynamically. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6042.348s">I</a> mean, obviously we know that this project's been a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6044.589s">It's</a> been going on for about a part of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6046.89s">So,</a> you know, the MOU says what it says, but it might be time to go back to the table and really <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6051.142s">look</a> at what's going on and try to figure out if this traffic management plan is the best and what we can do to get additional crews out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6057.104s">I</a> always find it interesting when a resolution makes its way into the agenda and then someone from the administration comes and says, actually on Monday, we have three crews out there working now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6065.546s">And</a> that's gonna be the first day it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6066.927s">It</a> seems kind of reactionary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6068.647s">And</a> I don't blame the city engineer for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6070.668s">I</a> know that he has a lot going on and that he only has limited control over certain aspects of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6076.55s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, is city decision-making contributing <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6082.188s">a</a> lack of city decision making contributing to the ongoing delays as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6085.109s">And</a> I think that's important to consider.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6152.052s">Before</a> you go through this, I will be withdrawing this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6155.113s">The</a> governor has extended the special pocket outdoor dining regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6159.975s">Massachusetts</a> Restaurant Association had worked with the governor's office to extend certain provisions of the emergency order that were lifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6167.637s">This</a> is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6168.878s">So</a> with that being said, the purpose and intent of this resolution has been addressed and there's no need for further discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6288.054s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6288.894s">I'm</a> thinking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6291.755s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6551.944s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6553.064s">I'd</a> answer the councilor's question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6554.585s">For</a> all two hour parking spots, you're allowed three hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6556.986s">You</a> get an extra hour every whatever the spot says in terms of if it's a one hour spot, you get two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6562.508s">If</a> it's two hours, you get three hours according to the police department website. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6566.149s">But</a> I wonder, Mr. President, if there's a way that we could implement the mechanism where an individual, if they get a parking, if they get a ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6572.509s">This</a> is an automatic mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6574.23s">If</a> it's someone that's over the age of 65, upon payment of the ticket, they're also given an application to apply for the senior citizen parking pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6580.934s">So,</a> say an individual that's over the age of 65, like yourself, got a parking ticket, oh, say down out in front of a place, maybe, I don't know if it's been there, Magnificent Muffins, you know, and you got a ticket out in front of Magnificent Muffin, when you paid the ticket, then they'd have an automatic mechanism to say, Richard Caraviello paid this ticket, he's a Metro resident, we know what his registration says. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6599.085s">Can</a> we send him an application in the mail? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6602.103s">that</a> says you're eligible for the 65 plus parking program is the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6607.825s">They</a> have no problem sending out late notices when people don't pay Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6611.046s">I</a> think that, you know, in an effort to address some of the issues like Councilor Scarpelli brought up with the amnesty day and stuff like that, this might be a way for us to get in front of some of these issues that are arising. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6621.525s">with</a> Park Metro number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6622.506s">Number</a> two, it seems to me like Park Metro is out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6626.209s">We</a> did get a correspondence from the administration relatively recently indicating that their contract was up relatively soon and the administration is having meetings of some sort to discuss the future of parking in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6639.481s">I</a> understand that we did have a committee put together to do some examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6645.606s">I</a> felt the presentation was a little bit focused <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6647.845s">more</a> so on the Greenland extension sites and a little bit less on citywide efforts and endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6651.989s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think that an automatic mechanism that notifies seniors that they're available and that they're eligible for this type of service, this type of amenity that the city can provide would be very helpful to the residents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6665.924s">So</a> I'd like to offer that in the form of a motion as to whether or not Park Metro can determine <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6670.704s">if</a> there is a way that they can offer, extend applications to residents in the community that are 65 years or older, when they pay a ticket that they received. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6680.787s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6886.961s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, on Council Max's point, I think it's also important to point out that the administration had recently asked the council to fund a position called the COVID-19 communication specialist. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6898.045s">So</a> I don't see any reason why if Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6899.605s">O'Connor</a> is not available, that this other city employee that works in the press office can't appear before the council and provide us with the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6907.228s">Thank</a> you, Council Max, for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6909.649s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6987.825s">Mr.</a> Clerk, can you put that into the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6989.106s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, because I do believe this council voted and we said, you know, we'd appreciate you coming to give us an update, but we also want it in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=6995.988s">The</a> reason we want it in writing is so we can keep a record of what's going on so we can have a snapshot in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7001.19s">So</a> we don't have to go back and watch a meeting from two years ago about the other source construction pipeline per se, when we have paperwork that they gave us on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7009.034s">So</a> I concur with councilor Falco 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7011.815s">You</a> know, we have a very well-funded communications office and we should be getting communications.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7234.117s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's also very important when we look at, you know, not only the seniors in that community, not only the administration of government, but you know, what families rely on in the summertime, um, you know, the recreation department, participation limits surrounding summer fun camp, rights, pawn tops pool, um, the recreational programs that are offered to the rec department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7255.446s">They're</a> all right now limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7257.421s">because</a> of the participation limits, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7259.482s">So</a> if you wanted to sign your kid up for the Saturday morning basketball league, it's $145 for five weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7264.844s">You</a> get 45 minutes a week, and it's limited to six kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7269.186s">We</a> have a community of 60,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7271.226s">If</a> you wanted to have your kid play in the recreation department's basketball program, it's limited to six kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7277.029s">It's</a> less than 1% of the population. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7278.529s">Point</a> of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7280.09s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Scapino.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7317.331s">So</a> when you say there's important, when you say their Councilor, you're referring to the governor, the governor, not the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7323.477s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7323.817s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dpVBOZN8pE&t=7324.017s">Because</a> when I recently checked the recreation website, the participation limits was still at six, six people per event.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4/2024-11-19_iFHofazjCG4.html">City Council 05-18-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=104.965s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=106.306s">Last</a> week, we made inquiry into the status of the negotiations between our recreation department, building department, and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=113.27s">And</a> this week, I'd like to ask for an update on our clerical union. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=116.132s">It's</a> my understanding that both of these bargaining units have gone without a contract for an extended period of time, and I personally don't see any reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=123.036s">I</a> think that they should be at the table negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=124.798s">If</a> they're at a stalemate, then let the council know. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=127.5s">But</a> at this point in time, Mr. President, I'm asking that we get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=130.342s">Unfortunately,</a> in our packets this week, you will see that the mayor did respond to last week's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=135.525s">And</a> her response was, we will not comment on ongoing contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=139.648s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the resolution be forwarded to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=143.371s">with</a> the anticipation that they see the error in their ways and provide us with the information that we need to make informed decisions moving forward into budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=150.353s">If</a> in fact these two collective bargaining agreements are settled, it will have a financial impact on this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=155.514s">And</a> as the financial watchdog in this community, the Medford City Council, the body responsible for the appropriation of funds, I think it's well within our scope and authority to be informed of these decisions and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=165.257s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=381.604s">If</a> I may, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=384.726s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=386.502s">I</a> look at this situation with the 40B developments that are going on in this community, Mr. President, and I look at them as missed opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=393.584s">And</a> we have an administration that campaigns on affordable housing and then fights tooth and nail to prevent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=399.525s">With</a> just one of these projects, we're looking at probably close to $2.5 million in permitting fees, probably $250,000 per month in property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=410.132s">And</a> it seems like it's a frivolous fight when five separate consultants, all independent of each other, say that the city's glam calculations are incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=418.618s">So</a> I really think, Mr. President, that they should have run a friendly 40B. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=422.461s">We</a> had Judy Barrett working with us, who's the renowned 40B, friendly 40B expert across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who's no longer with us for a variety of reasons, I think, that surround <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=435.93s">the</a> ongoing litigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=437.832s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the councilors for bringing this up and I certainly look forward to bringing this solution, this issue to a head because we talk about what's going on in the inner belt of 95 and the need for affordable housing and the need to increase housing production. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=452.585s">We</a> have a housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=453.947s">These</a> projects are mentioned in them, but where are we?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1332.468s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1332.968s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1334.784s">Maybe</a> we can get his grandson Michael to come over from Assembly Row and get to work on Medford Square just like his grandfather did. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=1340.835s">It'd</a> be quite a legacy that he could leave behind if that were the case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2545.545s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2546.505s">I</a> think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, this application isn't just for a sign that has movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2551.287s">The</a> sign is 36 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2553.351s">The</a> ordinance calls for a sign that would be 30 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2556.453s">This</a> sign looks like it's about anywhere between 10 to 15 feet in height. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2560.976s">And</a> our ordinance says that signs of this nature should not exceed six feet in height. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2564.458s">So</a> I think that this is clearly an issue where the council should not waste its time going through the exercise of futility of sending a two-way subcommittee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2586.653s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to clarify that a vote, a yes vote is to deny? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2591.053s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2592.194s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2665.971s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2667.812s">As</a> noted in the resolution, May 16th through the 22nd is EMS Awards Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2672.557s">And</a> our friends at Armstrong Ambulance have been a great partner here in the city of Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2676.48s">From</a> the amount of work that they do in community service, reaching out volunteerism, training everybody in CPR, the IEDs that they've, I mean, the IEDs that they've put out at local hockey rinks and parks and the like, Mr. President, Armstrong's just a great partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2692.191s">And</a> this week is EMS Awards Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2694.072s">And</a> today there's a celebration actually in Worcester, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2697.595s">It's</a> called the Convoy of Champions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2699.895s">where</a> they're going to be having a small parade and some MedFlight helicopters driving around to celebrate and highlight the work that our EMS professionals do in this community and communities across not only Massachusetts, but the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2711.361s">This</a> event is established by the Massachusetts Ambulance Association in coordination with its national partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2719.166s">And</a> Mr. President, if we look back, and we remember just a few years ago, this council congratulated Sean Main from Armstrong Ambulance for receiving the Star of Life Award <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2727.9s">And</a> this celebration that's going on this week is where the Massachusetts Ambulance Association will award the Stars of Life. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2737.826s">Two</a> local individuals are receiving them, a gentleman from Ireland and a gentleman from Saugus this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2742.529s">No</a> one from Medford isn't going to be a recipient this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2745.17s">However,</a> I think it's important to point out and highlight the good work that Armstrong Ambulance does. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2749.153s">They</a> go above and beyond the call of duty, Mr. President, to be a partner in this community and a part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2753.835s">And</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=2757.423s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3447.734s">On</a> that topic, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3449.715s">It's</a> not uncommon that the city and the state enter into what's called maintenance agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3455.318s">Sleepy</a> Hollow being a perfect example of the Sleepy Hollow stretch along Route 16, leading up to the continent shells underneath the maintenance agreement, so the city methods responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of that area but they really have no control and direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3467.805s">Other</a> than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3469.005s">So</a> these maintenance agreements to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=3472.703s">do</a> we have the ability to stretch our already understaffed and overstretched DPW this much further to start taking on more properties when we quite frankly are doing a bad job handling the properties that we have right now?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4173.206s">Also,</a> Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4175.107s">I</a> think it's important, Mr. President, that as we look at this whole entire process of the name change, that we don't get overly emotional and start to make this a political issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4190.179s">It's</a> a political issue and the family should not be subjected to the politics of this process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4196.444s">Jean</a> Barry Sutherland was nominated because she was someone that made a great difference in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4201.192s">And</a> I think that, you know, going forward, she should be remembered for all the positive things that she did in this community and not be part of a political campaign to discredit her as they move forward in this political process of renaming the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4213.715s">Because</a> I didn't have the privilege of going to the Dame School. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4216.195s">I</a> went to the Brooks, but right around junior high, I got a lot of friends that were over there at the Dame School that had Jean Barry, my friend, David Topper, very, very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4227.117s">To</a> this day, he says, it's all because of Jean Barry. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4230.825s">She</a> gave them the tools to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4233.467s">So</a> with that being said, you know, I just hope that the people out there in the community realize that Jean Barry has a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4239.011s">Her</a> family's here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4240.772s">I</a> don't think they're here this evening because the political process has been good to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4244.194s">And</a> as we move forward, I hope that we can move forward with some sensitivity because Jean's loss is still new and every day these people hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4250.819s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=4253.821s">Well</a> said.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5372.915s">Mr.</a> President, I do think we're losing a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5376.157s">I</a> think we might be losing a little bit of focus here. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5378.238s">I</a> mean, ultimately this body is not responsible for the naming of the school, the renaming of the school, the process to rename the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5384.081s">And</a> I think that's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5385.982s">The</a> only people that are responsible for the school committee chaired by the mayor, chaired by the mayor, the corner office, the corner office, Mr. President, not this, but this body has no ability to effectuate this change whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5400.109s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5456.535s">I</a> have no problem with what anybody's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5458.295s">My</a> problem is that there's nothing that we can do to fix it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5461.796s">I</a> just want to make that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5463.637s">I</a> agree a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=5464.897s">John,</a> someone's got to do something.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6949.142s">This</a> council stated time and time again that this is a school committee issue and it's not something we're gonna interject ourselves to get in the middle of. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6954.927s">I</a> mean, we've all said that on numerous occasions since this thing has started. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6958.37s">It's</a> a school committee issue, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6960.752s">So</a> let me finish, let me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6962.994s">The</a> school committee's made their mind up, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6964.956s">The</a> horse is out of the bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6966.417s">It's</a> already running around the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6968.389s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6969.009s">It's</a> already running around the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6970.05s">The</a> horse is out of the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6971.571s">You're</a> going backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6972.351s">You</a> got to focus on moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6974.112s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6974.352s">The</a> name is going to get changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6975.253s">The</a> school committee already voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6977.234s">You've</a> asked for reconsideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6978.354s">They</a> said, no, I'm not questioning their scope and their authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6981.536s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6982.076s">So,</a> I mean, ultimately that's like the school committee coming and telling us every other week, do something different, do something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6987.299s">You</a> know, we got to let them operate in this, in this sphere, in their world.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=6995.951s">You</a> know what I'm saying?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7009.563s">I</a> mean, I don't think I mean, I don't think there's anybody that's going to agree that was a good process. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7013.324s">The</a> process was flawed from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7014.605s">It's</a> been a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7015.785s">Quite</a> frankly, the city would be in a much better place if this was handled differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7019.226s">I</a> agree with you 150% and we have 150% this was a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7021.227s">And</a> we appreciate hearing that from you and I know a lot of the other Councilors agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7025.089s">But</a> I mean, I don't
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7054.431s">I</a> mean, it's a- With all due respect, I share your frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7058.554s">When</a> I think about frustration, I think about a $5 million structural deficit that we have coming up in the next year's fiscal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7064.359s">Those</a> are the things that give me anxiety at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7066.621s">Those</a> are the things that I lose sleep over.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7086.053s">I</a> guess what I'm getting at is in the grand scheme of things, out of all the issues and problems that we have in this community, this is one, but there are bigger ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7092.736s">There</a> are much bigger ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7093.936s">There</a> are much larger problems that we have in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7095.737s">Like</a> are we meeting our new growth figures so that we can just meet the inflation and the contractual obligations that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7102.953s">for</a> collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7104.634s">These</a> are big questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7106.176s">These</a> are big questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7107.117s">Quite</a> frankly, the process surrounding the school renaming did nothing to bring this city together to put us in a better position to answer them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7841.904s">I'm</a> Nicole and I go way back. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7843.345s">We</a> went to high school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7846.317s">I</a> have a question, because I'm not following. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7848.742s">People</a> said something, this, that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7851.448s">I</a> don't pay too much attention to the social media stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7853.793s">Well,</a> Adam, you should.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7859.386s">So</a> you have to go on social media to find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7863.709s">But</a> with that being said, who made these comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7867.011s">Was</a> it a was it a member of the committee?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7924.952s">The</a> reason why I ask is because if it's a committee member, a person was appointed to the committee, then they consider the city employee or a public employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7932.455s">So</a> that person would be subject to all the rules, regulations, guidelines, and policies that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7936.817s">So</a> if the school department has a policy for say, social media use, then the members of the committee should be subject to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=7942.7s">If</a> the school department has say a bullying policy for online bullying, the members of the committee should be subject to that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8034.846s">I,</a> you know, warning was that I hate to see the family be damaged by this issue because it's becoming so political.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8044.213s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8044.533s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iFHofazjCG4&t=8045.294s">Thanks</a> for answering my question.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ/2024-11-19_8uC6Vq145lQ.html">City Council 05-11-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=118.691s">This</a> resolution was filed at the request of a former colleague, Councilor Camuso, who's maintained a very long lasting friendship with Mr. Ercolini. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=127.257s">And</a> Paul and I were on the phone just the other day and we were catching up and he explained to me that Mr. Riccolini had just retired after 43 long years working at Filene's and Macy's as an electrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=138.721s">I</a> know Mr. Riccolini so I had the pleasure and opportunity to go to high school with his son, David. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=143.222s">We</a> played in the same basketball team together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=145.222s">And</a> it's great to see somebody, Mr. President, who's dedicated so much time to one company and has been able to reach the golden years of retirement after 43 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=154.145s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=156.946s">in</a> off-resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=158.306s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=198.957s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=200.318s">I</a> do feel as though this resolution is somewhat self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=203.759s">Ultimately,</a> the Building Department and Recreation Department had to do the contract negotiations with the administration, what appears to be over a year ago now at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=212.983s">It's</a> my understanding that the contract negotiations had stalled for some period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=216.945s">And</a> I'd like to ask for an update as to the status of the ongoing negotiations, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=256.124s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=262.328s">off</a> of the Fellsway over in that section of the city, Mr. President, I believe in Councilor Scarpelli's old neck of the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=268.112s">And</a> she's the mother of Maria Menounos, of local celebrity from entertainment news and the like, Mr. President, the classmate of mine from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=276.577s">And</a> she recently lost her mother after a very public battle with brain cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=280.139s">And</a> we all know what a great job the Menounos have done in being contributors to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=285.282s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to offer deepest condolences to the Menounos family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=823.074s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=823.634s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=824.935s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=826.235s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Marks, for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=827.996s">I</a> think it's spot on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=829.437s">I</a> had the opportunity to review the mayor's capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=832.878s">And</a> what I was able to do, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=836.275s">derived</a> through my analysis was that this capital plan calls for the resurfacing either partially or totally of about two streets a year for the next six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=846.902s">And</a> the only investment being made is chapter 90 funds, which is about $900,000 annually, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=853.706s">In</a> a community of this size, in the condition of the roads that we have, that investment is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=857.969s">It</a> needs to be reprioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=859.93s">This</a> capital plan needs to be reprioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=862.371s">For</a> the last, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=864.176s">12</a> months or so, we've been hearing about a pavement management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=868.417s">Now,</a> we had the call-in center come in and put together this capital plan that the mayor is using for FY 21 through 26, touting it as the first ever capital plan that's ever been implemented in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=879.78s">Apparently,</a> she doesn't remember, shot the course that the McGlynn administration had put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=884.541s">Perhaps</a> she doesn't remember the countless documents that the Burke administration had provided us that looked very similar to this capital plan that came out from the call-in center that the outside contractor provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=894.283s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=897.206s">And</a> I do feel as though the investment needs to be more than what it is right now, two streets a year for the next six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=904.972s">The</a> roadways and the condition they're in right now are not gonna be able to sustain the next six years without a far more significant investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=912.598s">So</a> with that being said, I second the council's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=915.683s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1306.858s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1309.619s">In</a> building upon what councilor Marks and councilor Falco said, this isn't just a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1318.964s">This</a> is more than a quality of life issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1321.024s">This</a> is a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1322.805s">It's</a> a service delivery issue, but most importantly, it's a pride issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1326.906s">I</a> mean, do we want to be known as the community when someone's driving into Medford from Winchester, they say, all right, get ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1331.727s">Here</a> we come entering Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1334.527s">When</a> they're coming in from Arlington entering Medford, driving down these terrible streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1337.528s">I</a> mean, that's not the image, Mr. President, that I think we want to portray to our neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1341.909s">We</a> have people in this town that are spending outrageous, outrageous amounts of money to purchase homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1348.407s">And</a> how long do we think that the residents are going to be able to put up with the lack of service delivery in direct correlation to their tax bills and what they're paying, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1361.096s">Because</a> right now it's significantly lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1362.877s">The</a> services that we offer are significantly lacking and we need to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1368.262s">I'm</a> seeing stumps in this community, and as Councilor Markswell, they've been there so long, they're getting taller. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1373.685s">I</a> see stumps in the city that are five feet high now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1375.926s">If</a> you look at the intersection of Winter Street and Lawrence Road, for example, there was a dead tree in front of the house there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1382.129s">The</a> resident asked for the tree to be taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1383.99s">The</a> tree never got taken down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1385.351s">Instead,</a> the tree fell down on the resident's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1388.391s">The</a> resident gets the tree removed from his front yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1390.433s">He</a> calls the city to remove the stump. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1392.015s">The</a> city cuts the stump. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1392.956s">The</a> stump's five and a half feet high, and it's starting to grow leaves out of it now it's been there so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1397.001s">I</a> mean, enough's enough, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1398.403s">It's</a> time that we stop putting the boots back on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1400.305s">We</a> reopen City Hall, and we get back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=1402.488s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2246.518s">Vice</a> President Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2248.044s">I</a> think we'd be remiss in not pointing out the role that Mr. McGilvray had. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2252.888s">in</a> professionalizing policing across America through his involvement in organized labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2258.692s">Mr.</a> McGilvrey was a champion on behalf of his colleagues, police officers across America, across Massachusetts, in fighting for collective bargaining rights and lobbying up at the State House for benefits for police officers in the line of duty, which he was one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2273.122s">And</a> if we think about the nature of the injuries that Mr. McGilvrey <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2277.865s">sustained</a> and how long he suffered, many would say that he'd still be with us today if it weren't for that fateful night and that accident that occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2284.51s">So</a> with that being said, this is a very prestigious honor, and I want to join Councilman Marks in extending my congratulations to the family for their hard work and perseverance in making sure that Mr. McGilvery's name is in fact included in the law enforcement memorial down in Washington, D.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=2302.221s">So</a> with that being said, thank you very much, Councilman Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3530.096s">So</a> from what I'm gathering, Brooke Hoyt has been appointed the COVID communication specialist?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3549.019s">Okay,</a> can we talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3557.062s">George,</a> maybe you can clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3558.802s">I</a> don't know if you were talking about the communications person or if you were talking about the emergency plan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3592.327s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3593.007s">You</a> tell us, Marianne, but I think what we're trying to find out is who the COVID communication specialist is that we just approved a position for a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3599.891s">Has</a> that position been filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3600.912s">Who's</a> in it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3712.425s">So</a> what I'm understanding is that the COVID-19 communication coordinator does not work for the Board of Health, the COVID-19 communication coordinator works in the press department, the city's press department?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=3747.988s">No,</a> he does not work for the board of health.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4013.989s">We</a> have information on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4015.19s">So</a> one of the information, Vice President Knight, I'm confused as to how we can have a city ordinance that dictates we have a sealer of weights and measures that's going to be compensated at a certain rate of pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4024.015s">And</a> then the administration decides that the ordinance doesn't exist and goes and creates a position that's a stipend job and gives it to somebody else.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4070.959s">Vice</a> President Knight, did you want the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4073.18s">I</a> just, sometimes I scratch my head and wonder why we have ordinances, Mr. President, if we're not going to go by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4078.161s">We</a> also can hope to uphold the ordinances of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4081.783s">And</a> then it seems to me like a lot of the time, you know, the ordinances are only read when it's convenient to the person that's reasonable.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4207.053s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4210.835s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4211.936s">The</a> way that I'm looking at this vote, Mr. President, is that we're eliminating the office of diversity and inclusion and we're merging those functions with the human resource office. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4220.61s">And</a> I think this council has been loud and clear that that's not what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4223.551s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4224.131s">We're</a> going to, we want to see a president to diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4226.672s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly have no problem voting against this amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4678.217s">Any</a> further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4680.258s">Mr.</a> President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4681.838s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4682.718s">Seems</a> to me like the city administration's committed to creating a lot of new jobs and a budget during this hiring freeze that you talked about Thursday night, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4692.441s">You</a> know, when we look at this position in particular, this isn't something that just came out of the blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4698.152s">This</a> isn't something that just came out of the blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4699.853s">On</a> January 1st, 2020, this council passed a resolution questioning the merger of this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4707.597s">That's</a> some 17 months ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4709.398s">This</a> council was on record questioning whether or not this was a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4712.46s">And</a> we've maintained consistency and we've been steadfast in our position on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4717.782s">So</a> when the city administration responded to it and said they don't feel as though it's a conflict of interest when the diversity director would also sit on the hiring panel <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4726.852s">And</a> if someone who didn't get a position felt as though they were discriminated against or had an issue, they'd have to go to the diversity director who's a member of the hiring panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4738.058s">Who</a> is that person servicing? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4739.599s">Is</a> he servicing the hiring panel and the administration as a member of the hiring panel? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4742.98s">Or</a> is he working as a director of diversity to address the issues that the person is bringing to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4746.562s">I</a> think councilor Falco hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4749.464s">The</a> city of Medford is one of the largest employers in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4752.525s">We</a> have a ton of employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4754.266s">We</a> need to make a commitment to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4755.945s">So</a> when we look at the history of the position and we see the council speaking out against it in January of 2020, the city administration initiating a personnel action form in January of 2020, the city administration initiating another personnel action form on 3-23-2020 with another pay increase, and then the city administration implementing another personnel action form on 10-22-2020 with another pay increase, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4785.503s">It</a> seems as though no one's listening to what this council is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4788.586s">So</a> with that being said, I'm going to stand with my council colleagues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4791.568s">The</a> commitment to diversity has to be real. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4793.11s">It</a> can be spun any way you want to spin it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4795.211s">But</a> at the end of the day, the council has been speaking about this for 17 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=4797.974s">And</a> we've been saying this isn't something we want.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5392.94s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5395.1s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5396.761s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5397.882s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, you know, Councilor Marks started talking about the capital improvement plan earlier and being a big government nerd got me all excited and got me reading this capital improvement plan over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5410.907s">And</a> when you look at the capital improvement plan, what you'll see in it, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5414.16s">is</a> that over the next six years, it's the administration's intention to spend upwards of $18 million on water and sewer infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5423.686s">The</a> capital improvement plan also says the investment strategy calls for all water and sewer projects to be funded from enterprise revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5433.732s">And</a> the meters, Mr. President, are not a part of this capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5438.656s">So</a> let's just get that out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5441.317s">you</a> know, the meat is not part of the strategy or the school improvement plan that they're discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5444.758s">So</a> the administration may be looking at it, but it seems to me that that started probably about 14 days ago when the speaker was up at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5453.079s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think it's important that we provide rate relief to the tax, to the rate payers, and I'll be supporting this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5460.461s">But,</a> you know, ultimately what we're doing is really developing this structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5464.482s">Every</a> year we're going to have to appropriate these funds, because if we don't, then as the finance director said, <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5470.2s">the</a> rate payers are gonna see sticker shots because their rate's gonna go up, you know, somewhere around 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5474.562s">So</a> with that being said, I will put the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5477.763s">However,</a> I would like to point out the inconsistencies between the capital improvement plan and what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5481.965s">Any</a> further questions?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5675.44s">Brady,</a> if I may interrupt you for just a moment and ask that you put your mask on due to the guidelines that the board of health has put out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5689.37s">Brady,</a> I'm not the one that creates the guideline. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5691.551s">I'm</a> just going to ask you to comply with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5693.032s">Can</a> you please comply with it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5699.848s">I'm</a> asking you to comply with the guideline, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5701.589s">Brady.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5701.929s">I</a> don't want to have to go down this road.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5705.271s">And</a> I'm asking you to please put your mask on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=5709.794s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6200.391s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6202.294s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6203.354s">I</a> don't think we need to get into what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6204.995s">She</a> said at this point, the speaker was able to articulate her thoughts and the gentleman was able to rebut. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6211.137s">It</a> may be appropriate for us to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6212.898s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=6213.358s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Doherty.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7097.999s">Point</a> of information, Vice President May. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7100.22s">If</a> you refer to our packet that we received this evening, we'll look at paper 21329, and that was a response from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7106.662s">We</a> were seeking guidance on how the money would be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7111.658s">says</a> it'll be coming midway pursuant to conversations the administration said with the Division of Local Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7118.342s">And</a> the mayor's response goes on to further, this was the mayor's response to a council resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7122.804s">Guidance</a> on how the money AARP will be coming by mid-May says BLS. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7127.147s">So</a> far, we only know we can spend it on lost revenue in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7132.91s">I</a> will refer this to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7134.251s">Menley</a> for response to the projected revenues on 42721, signed mail-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7139.202s">So</a> this council has taken those steps, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7141.303s">We</a> have asked for the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7142.184s">We</a> have asked where the funds are going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7143.985s">The</a> question is whether or not we're going to get the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7149.268s">I</a> didn't see that paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7246.249s">The</a> gentleman has a right to free speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7248.51s">No</a> one's going to stop him from standing on the front of the stairs of City Hall and screaming at the top of his lungs whatever he wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7253.695s">This</a> is also a city council meeting and there are some parameters that surround it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7256.597s">So</a> I can certainly respect the gentleman has something to say and I'd like him to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7259.64s">But</a> the same thing being said, you can't just come up here and just start saying whatever you want, whatever you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7264.114s">All</a> right, there has to be some parameters and they have to be deployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7266.315s">Mr.</a> President, I respectfully disagree.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7572.029s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7572.769s">I</a> just think it would be important to point out that the city council does not set the bottom line dollar amount for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7578.414s">That</a> bottom line dollar amount for the budget is set by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7583.88s">And</a> the mayor is also the one that would dictate how much money she would intend to spend on the school department and how much money she would intend to spend here on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7593.408s">I</a> believe last year we did a 60-40 split, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe 50-50. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7599.553s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I can certainly appreciate what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7603.156s">Mrs.</a> Rowan and I have spoken in the past on this very same topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7606.979s">It</a> is a school committee policy issue, and it's my hope that the school committee takes the appropriate steps to comply with federal law <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7613.95s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Haynes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7684.353s">Mr.</a> President, Vice President Knight, on that topic, I mean, ultimately, you know, I don't think the Medford City Council's gonna take up the role of being the Facebook police or the social media police of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7696.633s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7697.493s">Um,</a> I just don't think that that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7699.314s">And</a> I don't think that that's, you know, uh, really falls into the line of things that move mentioned forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7704.676s">Um,</a> so with that being said, I can appreciate the speakers feeling uncomfortable about online bullying. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7709.597s">And,</a> um, you know, it's something that we see every day from kids on up to adults, apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7714.319s">Um,</a> but with that being said, Mr. President, I personally don't think that, um, the Medford city council is the appropriate forum, uh, to air your grievances regarding what people said about you on Facebook and how they said it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7892.111s">I</a> would recommend calling Mary in the DPW office, and she'll be able to help coordinate the trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7898.775s">But</a> if they missed the whole street.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7901.316s">That's</a> why, if it was just me, I would call the number, but you look up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7905.299s">Give</a> a call to the DPW, and I'm sure that we can make that phone call in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7908.561s">We</a> can direct the city clerk to do such to have them be sure that they inform the mayor's office through the DPW and Mayor Menezes that trash pickup on Riverside Ave was skipped on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/8uC6Vq145lQ&t=7919.388s">And</a> I will offer that in the form of a motion.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI/2024-11-19_FOGKQdOAGpI.html">City Council 05-04-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=680.598s">as</a> was required earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=682.319s">Loosen</a> the restrictions on outdoor gatherings. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=684.902s">What</a> impact does that have on the rental of our public facilities here in the city of Metro?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=734.542s">as</a> really with the fields, because the fields are a revenue generating entity that we have here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=739.184s">And</a> when we were last here, we discussed a little bit about how the permitting process has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=745.427s">You</a> know, ultimately those fields do about $215,000 a season each. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=751.009s">So,</a> you know, we're approaching close to $700,000 in the rental of those fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=755.211s">They're</a> a revenue generating entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=756.752s">And</a> my concern is that we're not missing out on applicants that are seeking <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=761.053s">to</a> rent our fields when there are vacancies because of bureaucracy and bureaucratic delays.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=821.774s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=822.755s">So</a> I've spoken with a number of entities that have requested to use field space that have said, you know, on a Thursday afternoon, they find out that there's a vacancy at Medford and then they ask them to use the field space and then they never get a response and then they don't get to use the field space that weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=837.983s">Oh,</a> I don't know who they're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=840.024s">I</a> can't speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=842.065s">A</a> very popular ultimate Frisbee group, the Whitecaps actually, if you remember back a few years ago, the city of Medford was, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=848.235s">actually</a> featured on ESPN's top 10 moments when someone at Hormel stadium made an amazing ultimate Frisbee catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=853.776s">I</a> don't really know what that means, but, um, there was somebody that made, you know, a great play and they were on ESPN. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=859.057s">Um,</a> that was recorded at Hormel stadium and that group, the whitecaps, um, which historically used the field, um, in my experience, they've never had a problem until recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=868.079s">Um,</a> do we know, um, so in terms of applications that come in per week, how many applications are you looking at?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=904.656s">And</a> how does it work now? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=905.537s">So</a> an application will go into where?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=929.668s">Sure,</a> it goes to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=930.928s">What's</a> the mayor's office do to send it to your office?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=943.307s">The</a> field administrator handled that for a hundred years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=948.411s">Usually</a> the way it would work would be that the application would go into the field administrator, the field administrator would check for availability. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=953.994s">If</a> the availability was there, they'd secure the field for the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=957.837s">The</a> applicant would then fill out the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=959.398s">If</a> the paperwork wasn't completed and the payment wasn't attached, then the applicant wouldn't get to use the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=964.574s">It</a> seems like it was a little bit more streamlined and it was a little bit more of a guarantee that we were getting some money in our coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=969.799s">My</a> disappointment with the process is well known and well publicized, Madam Director, and I'm hoping that with the restrictions that are being loosened by the administration at the state level that they will also be loosened at this level.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=994.585s">It</a> could be micromanaging as well, but I just think that it's a really, you know, over bureaucratic and unnecessary stuff.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1352.594s">Vice</a> President Knight, I think it might make sense that we just give a brief breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1358.297s">I</a> have the paper in front of me, actually, of the agency that's applied for the funding and the recommendation for the upcoming CDBG fiscal year block grant that's being made by the Office of Community Development to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1371.504s">That</a> recommendation would go to the mayor, and then the mayor would have the opportunity to either say, I like the recommendation or she can <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1379.507s">use</a> our executive authority to change that recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1382.189s">But</a> in looking at this, I think it's important that we do inform the general public about what it is exactly that's being appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1388.973s">So</a> if we look at Bread of Life, they'd be recommended for the fiscal year, $2,603. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1394.477s">For</a> Community Tasks Incorporated, $5,045. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1395.498s">For</a> Community Family Inc., $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1397.119s">For</a> the Medford Council on Aging, $34,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1409.288s">For</a> Housing Families Incorporated, $13,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1410.669s">For</a> the Immigrant Learning Center, $6,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1412.63s">For</a> the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission, $15,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1414.812s">For</a> the Medford Public Schools, $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1416.613s">For</a> the YMCA and Mystic Community Market Boys and Girls Club, $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1420.615s">For</a> the Mystic Valley Urban Services, $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1421.716s">For</a> SCM Transportation, $105,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1422.697s">And</a> for the West Medford Community Center, $21,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1440.052s">We</a> have a total award for FY 21-22 of $1,546,988 with a 15% cap waived, allowing the public service entities to be afforded $232,048. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1444.714s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1445.474s">Alicia</a> Hunt, you had your hand up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1538.054s">Speaking</a> as a citizen out of 9200 Rubin Street, I'd like to see an increase in the funding for the metric consumer commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1543.879s">I</a> think we have <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1545.217s">an</a> opportunity here to really build upon some of the successes that we've made and the strides that we've made over the past years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1550.765s">And</a> this represents a reduction in benefits and an award from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1554.93s">And</a> I think that that's something that should be looked at a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1557.734s">The</a> individuals that are employed in the Medford Consumer Commission work right here out of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1562.423s">They</a> provide a valuable service to many of the residents here in this community, especially our senior citizens who have been falling victim to many of these COVID-19 scams, Social Security scams, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1573.246s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would like to speak out in opposition of the current protocols that are – the current recommendations that are in there and request that the Consumer Commission be afforded additional funds in line with at least last year's award.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1856.94s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, what's the purpose of us having a public hearing, then, if the people that come here and make comments in favor or opposition aren't counted towards the decision-making process?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1903.615s">That's</a> what I'm concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1904.696s">I</a> spoke as a citizen in opposition and asked for an increase in this funding in this line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1908.557s">Now,</a> if my, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1910.797s">voice</a> isn't gonna be heard or recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=1912.358s">I</a> haven't talked about that.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2013.689s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2016.03s">As</a> you can see, one might guess that opening day for Medford Little League has happened and I've been spending a lot of time down the fields and also a lot of time in our various neighborhoods in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2026.94s">And</a> through my travels, I have been approached by a variety of our residents here in the community requesting service requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2033.946s">Some</a> of these requests, I did direct the citizenry to go on to C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2039.331s">Some</a> of them I didn't, but you'll see some of these on C-Click Fix right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2044.816s">Sidewalk</a> hole, you know, majority of them are public safety issues, trip hazards. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2048.479s">The</a> bicycle frame attached to the pole on Bradley Road is something that I think should be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2053.364s">It's</a> been there for about, oh, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2055.027s">month</a> and a half, Mr. President, it's been stripped down now to just the bicycle frame, no tires, no seat, no pedals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2062.773s">It's</a> just literally a frame of a bike attached to a pole, and it's been there for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2067.437s">So</a> I'm asking that these items be addressed by IDPW or the appropriate department to rectify the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2075.003s">Sidewalk</a> Hole in front of Highland Development is a trip hazard, Deep Pothole and 3rd Street in Bradbury across from Harris Park is a trip hazard as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2083.388s">trip</a> hazards on Riverside Avenue and Walter Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2086.47s">Riverside</a> Avenue and Walter Street are the result of tree roots, Mr. President, uplifting the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=2091.753s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support these measures and request that the DPW or the appropriate department take necessary impromptu action to rectify the situation.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3738.764s">Vice</a> President night, I think Councilor Penta did make some good points when he spoke last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3744.787s">When</a> he got <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3746.034s">to</a> around the year 2015 or 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3747.695s">I</a> think we started a little far back in time and then it made our way into the present day. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3754.341s">You</a> know, but one of those things that he was speaking about that I was concerned about, really concerned about, was the inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3763.008s">And</a> I think Consul Max has been an advocate for this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3765.95s">I</a> mean, he's been speaking on it for years now at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3768.853s">I</a> mean, decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3769.493s">I</a> think it's been a decade at least that he's been speaking on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3772.178s">And</a> it's something that I think does warrant some discussion, or at least recommend some commentary from the Chairman of our Water and Sewer Commission, just to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3780.785s">So</a> I wholeheartedly support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3782.787s">I</a> thank the Council for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3785.649s">You</a> know, I think sometimes Councilor Penta does a great job giving us information and providing us with initiatives in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3793.936s">And</a> you know, sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3795.433s">I</a> don't think that, but in this one, I do think that this is something that we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=3799.294s">And</a> I certainly think that it's a worthy cause, so I support the measure wholeheartedly, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4000.55s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4286.309s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4288.889s">I</a> kind of think that Councilor Marks and Director Nunley are saying the wrong thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4294.971s">I</a> mean, the same thing, not the wrong thing, the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4296.771s">I</a> think that Director Nunley's <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4300.843s">saying</a> that we have the ability to reduce by department, but not necessarily line it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4305.627s">So</a> when I read her email and I look at the general block, I think what you're, what she's referring to is exactly what counsel Knox is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4312.293s">And</a> it's just really an interpretation issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4314.535s">Um,</a> you know, my understanding was that we didn't have the right to do line items, vetoes, and that's from the division of local services where <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4321.748s">because</a> our budget is presented to us by department for ordinary and personnel expenses, we have the right to cut the department saying we want to cut ordinary expenses by X or personnel expenses by Y and take that from the bottom line out of that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4334.672s">And</a> I think that the division of local services language, if you look at their briefer on it, it would say that the reason that they do that is because that would leave the <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4344.056s">If</a> you didn't do it by department, it would leave the authority up to the mayor to determine where to make the cuts, and the council would, in essence, just be reducing the bottom line of the budget, but not focusing on the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4352.38s">And</a> I think if we're going to take that steps, the way that we would have to do it is the way that was done in the past when it came to the assistant director at DPW's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4359.183s">That</a> was the proper and appropriate way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4361.784s">So</a> when it comes to the line item veto, I think that the finance director understands it the same way that we understand it, but she's just saying it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4371.806s">I</a> may be saying it in a way that we're not necessarily interpreting it to be the same, but my discussions with her over the week seem to be in line right with what Councilor Marksley said. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4381.332s">So</a> I'd be interested to have a committee of the whole as well, Councilor, President Caraviello, because I think that this is something that needs to be done.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4652.278s">Sorry,</a> Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4653.799s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4654.319s">Uh,</a> council Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4655.579s">Um,</a> the reason I bring it up is because I'm thinking back now we've got a lot of construction going on high street right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4661.7s">And</a> it wasn't too long ago that, uh, several members of this council stood up and tried to secure some parking spots along that stretch of high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4669.211s">when</a> this construction project was going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4671.133s">And</a> the response that we got from the administration was that the traffic engineer did a dashboard survey and feels as though there's adequate parking in that area for the residents, and that this would cause no disruption whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4687.365s">Now</a> we're seeing the construction started, what, last Monday? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4690.887s">And</a> now Park Metro is in the neighborhood tagging all the secondary streets off of High Street, which leads me to believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4698.51s">Maybe</a> the dashboard survey that was conducted might not have been the most accurate assessment of the parking needs of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4706.272s">But</a> that horse is out of the barn, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4708.312s">That</a> project is underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4709.393s">We've</a> accepted the funding, a million dollars from the state, and that project is underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4714.894s">A</a> little bit about the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4717.075s">With</a> the Eversource project that's going on along Winter Street, and the High Street project that's going on along High Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4728.472s">Every</a> street in between Winthrop and Hyde that run parallel to each other looks like a loading yard for a construction group, whether it be the Eversource project or the High Street project. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4740.64s">There's</a> just trucks parked all over every single neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4743.482s">I</a> mean, I drove down a street today, Mystic Street, the street that Councilor Scarpelli is talking about, up on Mystic in front of Tile Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4750.266s">And</a> there was like a rig that took up <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4753.273s">19</a> parking spots, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4754.734s">All</a> heavy equipment that was there all day long. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4757.976s">There</a> has to be a better way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4759.857s">You</a> know, if we wanna put these improvements in, that's one thing, but can we do it in a way that's maybe a little bit less detrimental to the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4767.882s">Maybe</a> a little bit, you know, kinder to the eye, because right now, it seems like that winter street stretch, these residents are getting croaked. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4776.667s">I</a> mean, it's between the rotary, the Ebbersworth project, the water pipe replacement project, <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4783.084s">They've</a> been under construction now for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4785.447s">Eight</a> years. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4788.01s">So</a> there has to be some relief in sight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4790.213s">I</a> thank the council for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4792.235s">And</a> I'm hoping that the administration, as she said, hears it loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4796.02s">She</a> hears the council loud and clear when we talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4797.622s">So</a> I'm hoping that this makes it to the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4800.728s">that,</a> you know, we need to come up with a better plan when it comes to engineering and permitting, ground opening and construction projects that we need to come up with a better plan that doesn't impact the neighborhood so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4810.833s">Because</a> what I feel like is happening in this community is someone gets a permit from the engineering department, and then they can do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4816.576s">They</a> can dig wherever they want, park wherever they want, leave their equipment, their debris, their materials, wherever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4821.439s">And</a> it's starting to take an effect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4823.78s">The</a> weather's getting nicer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4825.361s">People</a> are opening their windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4826.442s">People</a> are spending more time outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4827.762s">This</a> is what they want to see in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4829.682s">I'm</a> sure with that being said, I think the council will bring the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4831.963s">I</a> support all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=4833.063s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5126.647s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5127.227s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5129.731s">I</a> do believe when the council at first met with representatives from the city administration in ever so us at the suggestion of Council of marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5139.241s">One</a> of the items that came up was that as a condition of permitting, they not leave equipment materials, or use city property for state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5150.178s">and</a> that they agreed that they were going to take everything at the end of the day and get it out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5153.422s">The</a> trucks weren't going to travel alone if they weren't a licensed vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5156.446s">The</a> backhoes and excavators were going to be escorted with a truck in front of it and behind it so that no one would get hurt because we remember what happened in Mississippi and Doreen and one of our crossing guys as well I believe right down in West Medford Square where they got hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5169.37s">during</a> a construction project, when they were doing some work down there, I believe it was the Complete Streets Project, Mr. President of the Brooks School, where two residents were struck by construction vehicles because they didn't have proper safety protocols in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5183.558s">So</a> then I believe the Eversource project was put out to bid, and I think Feeney Construction got it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5187.74s">The</a> Feeney brother construction firm got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5189.961s">McCourt.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5191.122s">And</a> then Feeney backed out of the bid, and then it ended up getting awarded to McCourt. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5196.745s">But</a> the discussions that we had initially <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5199.312s">I</a> think we're all with Feeney brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5201.733s">And</a> I'm wondering if those restrictions and requirements that the council asked me to put in place on the permits carried over when the entity that was performing the work had changed.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5542.004s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5543.224s">I</a> have it all highlighted out so I can read it for you if you'd like.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5663.647s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5665.208s">So</a> what this paper is, is it's a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5667.165s">for</a> the city council to adopt a local auction provided by the Massachusetts state legislature to establish a youth commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5673.948s">And</a> I wouldn't expect the council to adopt the provisions of chapter 40, section 80 this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5678.73s">I'd</a> be happy to send this to a committee in the hall to be further discussed with the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5682.792s">However,</a> Mr. President, the intent of this is to give the youth in our community a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5688.895s">We</a> have commissions for everything, but we don't have a commission for probably the most valuable asset in this community, our youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5696.719s">So</a> with that being said, I think this is a step in the right direction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5699.641s">I'm</a> looking at the language that you just read. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5702.063s">I</a> appreciate you going through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5704.544s">Ultimately,</a> what this would do is establish a commission from not less than three and not more than 21 persons that serve for a term of three years, appointed by the mayor subject to the provisions of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5714.771s">The</a> city council can also create an ordinance that will go along with that, that would outline the defined parameters as to who's eligible to serve, similar to many of the other ordinances this council has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5725.735s">relative</a> to the creation or establishment of boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5729.317s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this will be a statutory commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5732.639s">It's</a> something that I think is necessary in this community, especially based on the high levels of isolation that you have seen across Medford over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5741.043s">Just</a> finally, we're finally getting out to the ball fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5744.025s">We're</a> finally getting out of the house with the vaccination moving along in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5748.068s">But</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that we create a mechanism for us to actually hear directly from our youth and don't let them be a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5755.333s">We've</a> seen what great work the CCSR has done up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5760.897s">Great</a> work it's done in getting youth engaged in the government processing and getting them to be civically responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5767.141s">And</a> I think that this is just adding to that, Mr. President, to step in the right direction for us to continue to build upon the many successes that we've already had in engaging our youth and getting them to be involved civically. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5777.903s">So</a> in looking at this, Mr. President, I think it's a great opportunity for us to move forward and create something that could make a difference here in the city of Michigan. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5786.008s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5787.889s">I</a> asked my council colleagues to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5790.11s">The</a> motion will be to send it to a committee of the whole for further review and discussion and for us to also ask the city solicitor to be present so that if it is the council's intent to move forward with this, she can draft a ordinance that would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5802.978s">With</a> that being said, I would arrest my case, Mr. President referred to before the councilor, Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=5809.143s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6405.566s">I</a> just wanted to point out there's some differences between this commission and the commissions that were mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6413.112s">This</a> commission is statutory in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6414.513s">So</a> this will be adopting a local option that's been provided to us by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6418.677s">And</a> because it's statutory in nature, there is a defined framework and parameters that are already in place that we have to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6425.987s">quite</a> frankly, this might be one of the easiest things we've ever had to do in our life, because the law pretty much says what's required in the ordinance and at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6434.214s">So</a> when we're talking about the Gender Equity Commission, which started out as, I believe, a Women's Commission, and then turned into a Gender Equity Commission with investigatory authority and all this other stuff, quite frankly, I think that during that discussion about the gender equity stuff, I think a lot of the message got lost in the process, Mr. President, what it was we were trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6452.288s">We</a> got, I think, a little bit too <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6456.267s">involved</a> with the minutiae and the details, bringing it down to the lowest possible level when we could have been able to put a framework together in a much more timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6465.129s">So</a> I can certainly appreciate the frustration that Councilor Morell has expressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6470.31s">However,</a> this is a little bit different than that situation, because this is something that's statutory in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6475.25s">By</a> adopting the enabling language, we already have the defined parameters and frameworks that's necessary for us to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6480.511s">So</a> with that being said, I do thank my council colleagues for their kind words, and I move for approval.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6746.368s">Mr.</a> President, El Tecuba, Cochina and Tequila Bar is probably one of the most frequent questions I get asked when I go through Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6755.494s">When</a> is this place opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6756.635s">When</a> is this place opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6757.675s">When</a> is this place opening? <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6759.027s">I</a> know we've had a tough year, Mr. President, in terms of the economy, the shutdown, the pandemic, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6767.193s">But</a> with that being said, from what I can see, they have a building permit on the windowsill, the windowsill wrapped up like there's some construction going on inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6774.157s">And</a> I'm hoping that we could just shoot off a correspondence by authorizing the city clerk to do such, asking for an update on the status of their expansion from Tanaka to Alta Cuba, Kachina, and Tequila Bar, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6786.168s">I</a> know that a lot of that business plan was contingent upon the reopening of Shibahia Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6791.052s">And</a> from what I heard this morning, or earlier in the meeting, I should say, from the Director of the Board of Health was, it seems very promising that we're going to have events there at some point in time in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6801.261s">So</a> with that being said, hopefully we can kind of get a little update as to what's going on with El Tecuba and also with what's going on at Shibahia Auditorium, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6810.578s">So</a> I'd asked the city clerk to send off an email provided that my council colleagues support this resolution to reach out to the business owner and just ask what's the status. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6819.861s">This</a> was a license that was granted by the council and it was placed on a list for a 90 day review, 90 days after opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6827.143s">The</a> 90 days, the summer of 2020 maybe, June of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6833.025s">Yeah,</a> it's been a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6834.785s">So</a> it's been a bit of time and you know, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6840.7s">But</a> I'm just more curious than anything else, Mr. President, as to what the status is. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6845.542s">If</a> nothing, then maybe this is something that we refer up to a new Director of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6852.426s">If</a> in fact there are some hurdles or some problems that this business faces in expanding because there's so much community excitement for it, there might actually be a resource there in City Hall that can help them cut through some of the red tape or find some creative ways to meet some of the needs that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6866.156s">I</a> think that was, you know, the whole goal and purpose of us creating the position of Director of Economic Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/FOGKQdOAGpI&t=6871.34s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, maybe this can be the first project that he gets assigned, and now we can see if Delta Cuba can open.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1638.768s">Vice</a> President Knighton. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1642.43s">I</a> believe Republic Parking is the parking enforcement agent that is acting as Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1648.478s">It</a> uses ParkMobile as the application to allow individuals to purchase parking electronically. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1654.602s">And</a> the data breach affected that third party vendor, who is the largest in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1661.246s">So</a> it seems to me like Metro residents have been impacted because they have been notified.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1759.04s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1760.26s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1761.9s">One</a> of the best kept mysteries in the city of Medford is how to get a brick down at Tufts Park at the Gone Too Soon Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1768.581s">This</a> issue has been brought to my attention a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1771.542s">I've</a> tried to <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1772.978s">reach</a> out to individuals that are associated with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1775.799s">And</a> that's, it's really been a non fruitful search. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1780.201s">However,</a> I think that this going to some soon Memorial in Tufts Park is something that needs a little bit of love and attention, Mr. President needs a little bit more involvement from our city and our parks commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1792.985s">And</a> I think the application process also needs to be opened up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1796.006s">Since</a> the last time applications were accepted, we've lost a number of individuals in this community factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1800.9s">I</a> don't think anybody will ever agree that somebody's gone on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1803.302s">Everybody's</a> gone too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1804.824s">And</a> self-benefit is a great neighborhood filled with a lot of people that have pride from the area that they come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1810.209s">And</a> I've heard a number of individuals that are seeking applications for this purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1814.954s">So</a> I'm asking that the Parks Commission reopen the application process and maybe this summer we can install some bricks down at Tufts Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1822.201s">Also,</a> Mr. President, because we have the Community Preservation Act, <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1825.297s">I</a> thought that this might be an opportunity to see if we are eligible to receive CPA funding for this project to offset the cost for the families that are seeking to put bricks in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=1834.944s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2467.551s">May</a> I be so bold to suggest Mr. President that we send the paper to the administration and have them mark it up for us to reflect what existing practices and then we can build upon that document as opposed to us trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2480.854s">go</a> through that 60 year old piece of paper and figure out what it is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2515.324s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2517.545s">Existing</a> ordinance to reflect for the current ordinance to reflect existing practice.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2633.628s">Mr.</a> President, first and foremost, I'd like to congratulate Senator Russo on her service as the former president, the outgoing president. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2641.854s">She</a> did a great job over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2644.816s">But</a> recently, Mr. Pauli Camuso was elected as president of the Method Youth Hockey Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2649.9s">Mr.</a> President, I was wondering <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2652.362s">what</a> was going on with Paul and I kept seeing him show up at these meetings and the city council on TV every once in a while calling in and I didn't know if he was getting the bug again and he was gonna be seeking electoral office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2662.866s">But</a> I guess he is seeking electoral office, a subtle electoral office, but it was at the local level on the board of directors for Medford Youth Hockey, where he spends a lot of his time with his son, James. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2672.929s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, it's great to see Paul continue to stay involved in the community after so many years serving on this council and in the school committee and I just wanted <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2681.405s">reach</a> out and congratulate Paul for making another foray into elected politics and keeping his undefeated streak alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=2691.309s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3124.672s">As</a> amended by Council Falco Council night, just one further amendment Mr. President, to make this the most amended paper in the history of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GswFX5Excbs&t=3133.235s">I</a> just like to ask that we request a copy of the maintenance schedule for the spring for the city of med on the DCR as well.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=2636.881s">Vice</a> President Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4697.904s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4699.346s">And</a> thank you for my two colleagues that preceded me on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4704.189s">I'm</a> going to try to keep it short. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4706.091s">But</a> ultimately, Mr. President, bottom line is people should have the right to know what health risks are associated with devices that are being affixed to poles outside the house by government entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4719.04s">I</a> mean, that just <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4720.411s">It's</a> ludicrous to me to think that the federal government would not recognize health risk as a basis for denial of an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4727.537s">It's</a> shameful. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4729.018s">But</a> Mr. President, I think the understatement of the year was made this evening when Councilor Marks made his opening remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4736.684s">The</a> city of Medford was ill-prepared, ill-prepared for the 3/31 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4744.29s">Going</a> back to April of 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4747.674s">That's</a> when the first 5G site meeting was scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4750.735s">April,</a> 2019, two years ago, and it was canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4756.518s">In</a> August of 2019, then Mayor Burke came to us with this small cell ad hoc committee, and the council supported that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4765.061s">In</a> November, residents were notified of a site placement hearing, and that meeting was canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4775.965s">In</a> January of 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4778.271s">An</a> info session was held with Verizon and the members of this community here in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4782.294s">That</a> was a total and absolute failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4784.876s">Round</a> tables, no question and answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4787.438s">It</a> was more like a high school science fair than it was any type of symposium for residents to get questions or answers to their concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4795.465s">Which</a> brings us to January of 2020 yet again, when this council passed a resolution unanimously with, I believe, a councilor that was sitting here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4803.591s">No,</a> no, she wasn't sitting here anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4804.812s">Now</a> she was across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4807.574s">We</a> passed it unanimously asking the city call for a symposium where residents from this community could come and meet with the ad hoc small cell committee representatives from Verizon and the administration to talk about their concerns in the rollout of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4822.105s">That</a> never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4824.427s">The</a> very next week, Councilor Marks put forward a resolution because we haven't seen any movement that the small cell advisory committee implements stricter standards <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4837.634s">on</a> their application process to make it a little bit more difficult to walk into our community and do whatever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4844.036s">So</a> this is January 2020, February 2020, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4850.259s">March</a> 2020, there was a 5G site meeting that was scheduled and canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4856.121s">April,</a> May, June, July, August, September, radio silence, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4867.915s">No</a> movement, no activity, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4870.996s">November</a> of 2020, the city administration calls for an executive session with this council to discuss a potential lawsuit from Verizon to the cities in action on the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4882.96s">November</a> of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4885.6s">December</a> of 2020, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4888.781s">January</a> of 2021, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4892.623s">February</a> of 2021, a correspondence from the mayor's chief of staff indicating <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4897.742s">that</a> they're going to move forward with the site hearing for 5G with the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4904.868s">March</a> of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4908.591s">Scheduled,</a> canceled, and rescheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4911.333s">March</a> 31st, the meeting was held. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4914.296s">We</a> are two years, two years from the initial date that these applications became an issue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4923.724s">Two</a> for 24 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4926.089s">And</a> we are no further ahead today than we were on August 28th, 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4933.455s">No</a> further ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4935.636s">I</a> commend my colleague to doing his homework for raising the questions and bringing these issues forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4939.6s">They're</a> serious issues, serious issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4942.702s">And</a> to think that one of us behind this rail is gonna take a vote not knowing if one of those devices can cause cancer to just one person in this community is insane, is insane to think that we're gonna take that risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4954.975s">We're</a> going to take that risk, and it's shameful for the federal government to put us in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4959.158s">I'll</a> stay with my colleagues all day on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4960.939s">I'm</a> not taking a vote that's going to hurt people and put the health at risk if we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4965.082s">If</a> we don't know, we shouldn't be taking the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=4967.564s">And</a> I stand with my colleagues on this, and I thank you both for bringing this forward.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7582.129s">It</a> seems like we're talking a little bit more about national politics and state politics than we are about local stuff.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7668.947s">Having</a> worked in the legislature for a number of years, I've witnessed firsthand the fact that nothing ever comes out the way it goes in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7889.467s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=7891.367s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8441.769s">Mr.</a> President, I share Councilor Falco's concerns wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8445.069s">As</a> a matter of fact, this is a topic that I've brought up in the past as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8448.59s">And</a> when we look at this month's Warren article, this previous month's Warren articles, we'll see that we've received <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8456.776s">seven</a> bills of $5,000 to the tune of 30K, Mr. President, for what is labeled as, I'm sorry, six, I'm sorry, six, 30K. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8471.4s">Monthly</a> legal retainer, it says, monthly legal retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8474.221s">So</a> six months, monthly legal retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8476.121s">And</a> this is being paid, Mr. President, out of the professional services legal line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8481.122s">Now,</a> if we go to the previous year's budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8484.557s">We'll</a> see in the previous year's budget, underneath the law department, if we look for professional and technical services, other, that line item was funded at $1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8493.644s">Now</a> my assumption, Mr. President, is that this line item was not approved in the next year's budget at an amount that would be four or 500 times that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8506.354s">So</a> with that being said, it appears to me that they're doing some deficit spending and come the end of the year, there are gonna be some <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8512.059s">little</a> fuzzy math transfers that we're gonna be doing over here to figure out how we're gonna pay for this, Mr. President, because quite frankly, I don't see that it's being paid for out of an account that's funded to the level that it's being built. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=8523.988s">So</a> with that being said, I thank my council colleague and I support his resolution and I second it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9431.512s">We're</a> not going down that road.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9787.022s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9828.732s">Name</a> and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9829.813s">Tony</a> Pujol, I'm in Tanger Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9831.835s">Thank</a> you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9832.715s">Thank</a> you all for being in this beautiful chambers tonight to hear us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=9837.86s">I'm</a> not going to beat up a dead horse.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10611.184s">That's</a> okay, you've been waiting long enough.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=10785.83s">I</a> also believe that because it's a 40B project, there's some sort of contingency that would say that all the units that are developed can be considered underneath the safe harbor, as opposed to just the affordable units.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11225.508s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11229.291s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11274.096s">He</a> was a dear friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11274.936s">He</a> was very committed to American Legion Post 45 and the fundraising efforts and the volunteer and charity work that they do up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11281.558s">He</a> was a Verizon employee that worked at Verizon for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11284.638s">But</a> most importantly, Mr. President, he was one of those guys that would sweat blue and white.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11302.78s">So</a> Mr. President, I'm asking that my council colleagues join in and expressing their deep and sincere condolences to the family of McDougal, of Alan McDougal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11310.485s">He</a> was someone that certainly made a difference here in this community, certainly someone that touched the lives of many youth in this community, and certainly someone that has a legacy that deserves to be remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/0CWldZ_RYd4&t=11320.55s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case and ask my council colleagues to support the resolve.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=508.898s">So</a> 12 hours a day, seven days a week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=513.479s">And</a> then how many how many members do you have in your staff up there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=549.526s">Plus</a> this new permitting thing, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=552.928s">With</a> LaConti and home.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=570.079s">So</a> you think your office has the capacity based upon the number of hours that everybody's putting in right now to do these? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=574.98s">pre-screenings</a> of applications for people that are looking to rent the Hormel Stadium on the Coffey Rink? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=580.121s">We've</a> been doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=581.441s">We've</a> been doing that since the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=584.822s">No,</a> it was never a pre-screening before you could apply or get placement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=589.283s">It</a> should have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=589.783s">It</a> should have been.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=603.877s">So</a> so how's this going to work now can you just explain to me based upon you know the fact that your office is going to be handling the majority of these requests how this permitting is going to work for home Ellen my look on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=626.564s">The</a> fact that we got an email this morning saying that they've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=629.232s">a</a> number of changes to the way that two of our revenue-generating properties that we have here in the community are gonna be conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=635.997s">Now,</a> previously the way it worked would be that the applicant would seek placement at La Conte O'Hamel, they'd be provided placement, they'd be put in the schedule, they'd then have to go through a screening process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=647.805s">And</a> now it looks like that process is backwards or different, it seems like, from what I understood from this email that I got from Mayor Ungo, that she's taking control of some of the authority that the O'Hamel Commission has. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=658.925s">relative</a> to how they're supposed to be, you know, scheduling and booking events. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=663.969s">And</a> where these are two revenue generating facilities that we have here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=669.733s">And</a> quite frankly, they're very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=672.074s">If</a> it ain't broken, don't try to fix it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=726.707s">Is</a> that what happened with Ellington Catholic? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=728.709s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=730.03s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=731.751s">It</a> makes sense, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=733.012s">I</a> mean, if they have a plan that's in place, I mean, the CDC guidelines are going to be controlling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=737.575s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=739.676s">we're</a> really... They weren't following the guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=742.557s">That</a> was the problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=746.199s">Let</a> me tell you what, every single event that took place down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=748.44s">So</a> I'm pretty sure, you know, they may or may not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=751.322s">I</a> think that that's a blood accusation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=753.083s">In</a> any organization that hasn't followed the CDC guidelines, I'm sure that your office has taken the appropriate steps to find them and document such, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=787.128s">Wouldn't</a> it make it more sense from a number one, a consistency of government standpoint, number two, an operational standpoint that- No, not in a pandemic, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=798.392s">I'm</a> done talking, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=799.592s">I'm</a> done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=801.906s">I'm</a> not going to be able to finish, Mr. President, so I'll just stop right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=805.127s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1941.695s">Mr.</a> President, I'm just taking a look at the zoning use chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1945.215s">And</a> I certainly don't have any issue with Millett Automotive taking over this Fantasia Automotive location. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1950.796s">I</a> live in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1951.817s">I</a> know Mr. Millett, I see the type of business he's done down there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1955.997s">He's</a> done a great job over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1957.138s">He</a> keeps his lot clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1959.138s">He</a> is a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1960.678s">So</a> I have no issue or concern whatsoever about his ability or whether or not he'll be a good neighbor at the Fantasia site. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1966.381s">But</a> in looking at the zoning use chart, it says that under use 27, the accessory storage conducted entirely with an enclosed structure, the sale of rental motor vehicles, exclusive abuse car sales in a C1 district would be required for a special permit of the council, but it would also be required to be referred to the community development board first for review, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1988.339s">I</a> certainly don't have any issue approving this license this evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1992.549s">However,</a> if there is a requirement that it has to go before the CD board for hearing of some sort, I do want to make sure that the council is in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=1999.511s">So</a> I guess the question would lie as to whether or not Mr. Moki designates this application as a use 27 on the principal use chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2008.273s">So</a> we'll refer it to, if there's an issue, we'll refer it over to Mike and step out and call him even Mr. President, because I don't want to hold Mr. Mullet up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2015.975s">This</a> is more of a technicality and formality than anything.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2104.875s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2106.296s">Yes,</a> the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was kind enough to forward all the correspondence this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2111.279s">The</a> correspondence would provide us with an update as to the status of the ongoing construction of the ambulatory care center. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2117.403s">This</a> email goes on to read that beginning on Monday, March 22nd, we will begin planting trees and plants in the parking lot, islands, and surrounding buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2125.288s">This</a> work should be completed by Friday, March 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2127.909s">So</a> that looks like that was last week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2130.231s">Landscaping</a> work will be taking place on the corner of Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2134.266s">and</a> crews will be placing loom to prep for seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2138.127s">Following</a> the completion of the landscaping work, the repaving of the parking lot is scheduled to take place during the week of April 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2144.209s">All</a> work is weather dependent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2146.37s">Mr.</a> President, also in their correspondence, if you bear with me for one moment where I can find the other section of it, I will tell you that at 5.30 PM, the caffeine inside lobby lights will be reduced to 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2159.775s">At</a> 7 PM daily, the exterior bulbs and canopy lights will shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2163.886s">And</a> at 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2164.987s">the</a> ambulatory surgical care centers lights will shut off as well as the PACU, which faces the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2172.353s">Also</a> the landscaping work was what the major activity was on the corner of Governor's Avenue, Winthrop Street, that was such a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2178.678s">I'm</a> not Winthrop by Governor's Avenue and Lawrence Road, which was such a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2183.281s">So</a> that's the latest update from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital based upon the correspondence that they were so kind to forward to us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2386.571s">Mr.</a> President, that'd be 90 days after it opens, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2737.563s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2740.845s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2741.865s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2744.026s">I</a> remember this bus line is how all the kids from the Heights got the public skating when we were kids growing up and Kenny Phillips would be driving the bus and bringing everybody up and down the hill and putting up with kids to watch around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2755.792s">But</a> no, in all seriousness, it's not just kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2758.873s">It's</a> not just seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2759.653s">It's</a> not just commuters that are using this bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2762.034s">This</a> is really one of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2764.341s">only</a> bus lines that we have here in the community that connects certain portions of Fulton Heights to the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2771.005s">You</a> know, the MBTA talks about how they wanna restore service to pre-pandemic levels, but they're not gonna. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2777.249s">The</a> MBTA talks about how they want to see increases in ridership as the Metropolitan Area Planning Council has all the communities surrounding us stop more and more people into high rise luxury condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2789.657s">The</a> MBTA continues to cut service, cut lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2792.84s">You</a> know, with the 326, the 325, the 710 commuter rail hours are being cut back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2797.742s">The</a> service that's being provided to this community, Mr. President, in my opinion, does not add up to the amount of money that we're paying on our assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2804.944s">And</a> quite frankly, I feel like Medford is somewhat always the heel because of where we are geographically located between that crux of rail service and bus service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2814.087s">We</a> get beat up on both ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2815.247s">You</a> know, we look at the issues that we've had over time with the Salem Street car bond, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2821.175s">and</a> other facilities here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2823.096s">And</a> when we raise concern, they fall on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2826.179s">But</a> when the MBTA wants to come in and cut service, it's pat on the back and, you know, take your lumps kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2833.263s">It's</a> getting kind of old, Mr. President, quite frankly, and I'm tired of the attacks that we're seeing the MBTA take on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2839.648s">The</a> MBTA raises that green flag, the Green Line extension, and they say, well, we're giving you the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2844.551s">Well,</a> I'm going to tell you right now, I know a lot of people in the Fulton Heights that are never going to see that Green Line extension, they're never going to step foot on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2850.097s">But</a> I'll tell you what, the 710 bus does a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2852.82s">So</a> I thank you and I thank Councilor Falco for putting this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2856.084s">It</a> does bring back some great memories of taking that bus as a child being from West Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2859.768s">And</a> there was no other way to get up to the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2862.211s">I</a> certainly wasn't walking that hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2863.813s">That's</a> for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2864.714s">And</a> as a child, Cow Park was one of the most active parks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2869.532s">There</a> was no other park where you could find a better pickup basketball game besides Carr Park and Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2874.233s">Two</a> parks that always had kids playing, Harris Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2876.214s">The</a> three parks that always had kids playing, all geographically located in the community that are real far apart from each other, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2881.575s">So</a> this connectivity is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2883.536s">We</a> talk about wanting to take cars off the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2885.356s">We're</a> putting bike lanes in, bus lanes in, and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2887.777s">How</a> can we put bus lanes on Mystic Avenue and then take away a bus in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2891.098s">Don't</a> we want to promote bus use? <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2893.334s">So</a> with that being said, I thank you both for putting this resolution on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=2896.376s">I</a> just ask that it also be sent copies to our state delegation so that they're aware of this correspondence going out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4653.758s">I</a> do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that when this matter came before the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4657.622s">The</a> vote that the council was asked to take was to whether or not they were going to allow the administration to enter into a contract that exceeds 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4664.865s">Pursuant</a> to state law, a municipality can only enter into a contract with a maximum term of 36 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4669.948s">So</a> the issue that was before the council wasn't whether or not we wanted to have pocket meters or no pocket meters, have pocket enforcement officers, but not have pocket enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4677.011s">The</a> issue before the council at the time was whether or not we wanted to authorize the administration the opportunity to negotiate a contract that exceeded three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4684.115s">So</a> that was the matter that was before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4685.455s">I</a> certainly have the same concerns that I had <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4687.654s">Um,</a> for previously when it comes to Republic packing and the accounting methodology that's being used with the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4693.079s">Um,</a> but that's neither here nor there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4694.4s">The</a> administration is the entity that's responsible for the chief negotiation of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/ilBXW43EmQ8&t=4698.564s">And</a> these three air extensions are going to be incumbent upon her purview, not us.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q/2024-11-19_YjIKMi7y7_Q.html">City Council 03-23-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5335.614s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5337.035s">And</a> to Marie, I know you're probably at home watching, embarrassed because of all these kind words that the council is saying about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5344.428s">but</a> every one of them is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5347.049s">I</a> always picture Marie Cassidy as a person that never has a bad day. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5350.851s">Every</a> time you see her, she's always smiling, full of energy, full of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5354.292s">But</a> most importantly, she's always focused on the end goal, focused on the mission, focused on the prize, which is furthering the Medford Family Network and its interests and objectives here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5366.097s">And</a> she's done a great job doing that, Mr. President, as evident by the number of awards that you so eloquently spoke of earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5372.652s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, before Marie turns 71, I'd like to wish her a happy 70th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5378.898s">So</a> I join my council colleagues in extending these well wishes to her, and I wish her the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5384.102s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5384.482s">Council</a> Member Rao.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5656.773s">Mr.</a> President, I'd second the approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5660.155s">I</a> wish Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5661.936s">Campanoni</a> the best of luck in her new endeavor, and hopefully things work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5666.878s">But</a> I certainly see no problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5668.459s">It's</a> an existing use. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5669.56s">I</a> think it's a wash vault now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=5671.561s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6602.166s">I</a> just reviewed chapter 91, section 10A, and it says that the permitting authority would be the Harbormaster, not the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6615.073s">I</a> don't recall previously approving this in the past when they were in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6641.288s">So</a> I mean, I just want to make sure we pass the smell test that we're doing it right, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6645.952s">If</a> the statute says we need to have the harbor masturbation permit, the harbor masturbation permit, not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6650.175s">That's</a> the only thing that I was concerned about.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6760.187s">Either</a> way, I think that the council would need to issue a special permit on it, regardless of whether or not the harbormaster does, because it's a recreational use. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6767.328s">It's</a> a private entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6770.692s">public</a> consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6772.233s">So</a> the council needs to issue a special permit on anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6774.995s">I</a> just wanted to be sure that the Habermas, because all the appeals and the statutes say that the appeal of the Habermas decision to the state and the state makes a ruling on the Habermas decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6785.243s">I</a> certainly have no problem with, you know, the kayaks down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6788.706s">I</a> live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6789.427s">It's</a> not something that I utilize actually.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6827.183s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6829.345s">Should</a> legislative action have been enacted to appoint somebody other than the harbormaster to do it, where the city's had a harbormaster for, I can't tell you how many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=6836.19s">I</a> don't think there's any legislative action that exists that would have been taken to authorize that authority to anybody else under the city ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7174.517s">Yes,</a> I was just wondering what the term of the permit was in terms of from when to when?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7204.11s">So</a> do soccer clubs have to get a fee to go to the park so they pay guys who run an operating game pool business with no permitting fee?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7218.615s">That's</a> not on land either, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7219.976s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7260.864s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7262.324s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7263.124s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7263.724s">In</a> essence, we could be given them a nine month or a 10 month permit to operate, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7269.466s">It's</a> probably probably four or five months, six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7271.206s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7271.486s">It</a> could be, but yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7272.526s">You</a> know, we don't define the parameters.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7274.647s">If</a> you can get us the perimeter of what the season is, then yeah.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7285.734s">I</a> personally, I think they provide a benefit to the community, the service they provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7288.556s">I'd</a> like to see a little bit back to the community based upon what they're earning. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7294.601s">But</a> at the same time, I know it's something that people love and it's something that I don't have a problem having in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=7568.241s">Just</a> a point of clarification for the 5G, is that the digit five or the word five?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8954.662s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8954.922s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YjIKMi7y7_Q&t=8955.403s">Council</a> Max, the chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=284.094s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=285.816s">This</a> resolution has been put on the agenda on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=291.08s">The</a> Massachusetts Motorcycle Association is the premier organization that lobbies for motorcycle safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=297.486s">Many</a> of us <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=298.527s">around</a> town will see the signs on their coordinated campaigns across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=302.97s">Motorcycles</a> are everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=304.631s">Big</a> yellow signs with black writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=306.092s">I</a> think look twice and save lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=307.974s">Mr.</a> President, the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association has been at the forefront of motorcycle safety initiatives for as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=315.019s">Tonight</a> we have with us Mr. Paul Cote from the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association, who I met some 15 years ago while he was lobbying up the statehouse for motorcycle safety initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=324.685s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm offering this resolution on behalf of the Massachusetts Motorcycle Association and the motorcycle community here in the city of Medford to promote safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=334.269s">It's</a> an unfortunate and tragic fact that Medford was the site of a motorcycle fatality last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=339.272s">A</a> Malden resident was killed in an accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=341.413s">And</a> it's initiatives like this that help us bring awareness to the safety on the roadways and what's necessary and to be sure that we share them with the motorcycles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=349.436s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to ask Mr. Cote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2137.076s">It's</a> just... Mr. President, all we have to do is put the paper from last week on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2142.589s">We'll</a> take care.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2775.028s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2776.309s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2777.929s">Are</a> those totals cumulative or are they annual?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2781.512s">So</a> are you saying that in 2015, there was 300,000 now in 2016, there's 300,000 plus an additional 300,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2787.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2788.675s">Are</a> you saying that there's just $300,000?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=2796.757s">I</a> question the account.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3188.871s">When</a> this is a public participation item, I believe the proper procedure would be that the council would take it up and place it on the agenda next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3198.158s">It</a> will be correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3209.746s">So,</a> uh, because this is public participation, we changed the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3212.996s">last</a> year we said that public participation doesn't get a board number it doesn't need to be voted on by the council any councillor wants to address an issue in front of a public participation don't do so on the next week's agenda as a sponsor of the resolution thank you thank you i didn't hear what do you say thanks i didn't hear because i like as you explain that it's up to one of us to offer next week next week one of us can offer it they can do it now no not under the rules that we have there
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3441.266s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3441.646s">Vice</a> President Knight, this current program's being offered under the governor's executive order, is that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3520.701s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3522.262s">Mary's</a> a long time resident over on Grove Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3525.31s">She's</a> the proud grandmother of Preston Holt, one of Medford's finest firefighters, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3529.934s">And</a> just recently, she celebrated her 93rd birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3532.496s">And</a> if you know Mary, you know she's someone who's full of life, who enjoys her time down the beach in Cape Cod. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3537.4s">But</a> more importantly, she's someone that enjoys her family and loves the city of Medford.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3586.293s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, it's with great anticipation that many of us await the opening of our schools for in-person learning on a full-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3593.598s">And</a> with that being said, we're going to see an influx of vehicles driving to middle schools and schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3599.402s">I</a> mean, you look at Freedom Way and the condition that the roadway is in, I think it's an area that needs some attention, Mr. President, before the schools open back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3606.327s">So</a> I'm asking that DPW go down there and take a look and do some patchwork to ensure that when school does open, that it's safe and also <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3614.338s">If</a> I can just amend the resolution, also take a look at the crosswalks to be sure that they're properly striped and not school districts.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3799.593s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3801.375s">Ghost</a> Kitchens are an interesting new business model that's been popping up around the city, and it's something that's sparked my curiosity more than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3812.183s">You</a> know, I've noticed we have Kiki's Barbecue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3816.166s">We</a> have Mr. Beast Burger. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3819.184s">We</a> have Guy Fiori's Flavortown Kitchen, all ghost kitchens that are operating out of the city of Metchen. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3825.029s">I</a> was just wondering what the regulatory criteria was, whether or not the Board of Health had some sort of filing process that was necessary, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3833.355s">The</a> reason that I ask is because, God forbid, somebody ordered delivery from one of these places and got sick and then wanted to call the establishment or reach out to the establishment for whatever reason they may have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3843.763s">They</a> won't be able to find them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3845.192s">So</a> I just wanted to be sure, Mr. President, that there was some sort of process or what that process wants in place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3850.134s">So</a> I'm just asking the question from our Director of the Board of Health and the city administration as to what the process is for applying for a ghost kitchen, if there even is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3858.037s">It's</a> as simple as that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3870.241s">I</a> certainly wouldn't have a problem with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3915.983s">In</a> essence, it's the subletting of your license, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3919.024s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3919.444s">In</a> essence, it's subleasing your existing license.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3929.811s">I'm</a> not opposed to it, Mr. President, quite frankly, I think it brings a lot of options and opportunity to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3935.214s">I</a> just want to be sure that we're doing it right and we're protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=3937.575s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5082.071s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DEN45jLIzGE&t=5086.134s">With</a> the pandemic guidelines and restrictions that are in place, I don't think we're going to get a true picture.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_8GLOO-_Tbro/2024-11-19_8GLOO-_Tbro.html">City Council 03-09-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1313.827s">to</a> do, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=1314.747s">I</a> mean, she's the only way I know the worst.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3860.203s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3861.804s">I</a> think it's important to point out, and I understand what the council is saying, and I don't want to interrupt them, but I think it's important to point out that this base fee is something that's implemented by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3871.358s">It's</a> not a vote that was taken by the council, does not require council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3875.059s">It's</a> under the purview of the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3876.96s">They</a> meet monthly to discuss these type of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3879.621s">And</a> that the accounting that's being done should be done in accord with the GAA, the Government Accounting Office, the General Accepted Accounting Principles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3890.004s">And</a> looking at what the gentleman's saying, I do have some agreement with what he's saying, but there's also some items that we need to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3896.706s">And</a> the first item we need to clarify is this is the doing of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3899.971s">This</a> is the doing of the administration of the Water and Sewer Commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3992.271s">I</a> didn't say you didn't have legitimate concerns, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=3994.513s">What</a> I said was that it needs to be pointed out that the Medford City Council isn't the one that implemented these fees, and Medford City Council isn't the one that has the purview to remove them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4024.864s">But</a> the matter is never going to come before us for us to vote up or down because it is not within our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4029.866s">It</a> is within the purview of the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4031.746s">So</a> the beef is not here in the Alden Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4034.507s">It</a> should be in room 201 with the Water and Sewer Commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4839.248s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4841.229s">When</a> I learned that the existing council appointment, Mr. Guayona was not interested in reapplying for the position, I became very concerned about how we were going to fill this position and what quality of candidates we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4852.997s">And</a> when I saw the email of one, Mr. Brian Collins and his interest in serving on the position, it certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4860.758s">set</a> my fears at ease. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4862.099s">I've</a> had the ability and the good fortune of having to work with Brian for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4866.221s">I</a> also grew up in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4868.202s">Don't</a> let him fool you, he's a West Medford legend. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4869.883s">Everybody</a> who grew up in West Medford knows Brian Collins, knows who Brian and Mark are. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4873.645s">He's</a> a great guy and he's someone that puts his money where his mouth is, Mr. President, has a great proven track record of bringing successful programming to our community and also thinking outside the box. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4884.097s">And</a> watching what he's done down in the center, it's unbelievable to see the amount of program and the amount of effort and hard work that he's put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4889.96s">How</a> the center's evolved over the last 12 years since he's been involved is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4894.163s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly feel very confident in the application of Brian Collins to serve on the whole mail commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4902.108s">And</a> I for one would move for approval of appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4904.549s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=4906.83s">Council</a> Bis.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5305.202s">Mr.</a> President, I was going to put a resolution on next week to thank him. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5308.404s">I</a> would have had to do that now that you went out of my sales here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5398.509s">Here</a> in the city of Medford, we have about 140 miles of roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5402.395s">And</a> if we look at the capital plan that was released last week, I had the opportunity to watch the meeting on local access television. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5409.421s">Pat</a> Gordon did a good job delivering that TV program to us last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5413.484s">If</a> you look at the capital plan, you'll see that over a six-year period, it calls for the resurfacing of about 11 roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5423.632s">Now,</a> we're a community that has 145 miles of roadway, and I don't think there's one street in this community at this point in time that's <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5431.672s">pristinely</a> paved from curb to curb with no potholes, no markings, no proper markings and signage, proper crosswalks and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5440.016s">Everybody</a> in this community uses roads to get from point A to point B, whether it be school buses, fire engines, plows, police cars, you and me, bicycles, pedestrians, everybody uses the streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5452.822s">And</a> the condition of our roadways at this point in time are subpar. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5457.004s">When</a> you look at surrounding communities, you can tell when you get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5461.034s">because</a> the pavement changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5462.855s">When</a> you drive from Bedford into Malden, all of a sudden the ride gets a little less bumpy. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5466.638s">The</a> same thing when you go into Arlington or Somerville or Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5469.499s">So</a> Mr. President, we have a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5471.321s">We've</a> heard a lot about this pavement inventory that was going to be taken by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5476.364s">Ultimately</a> at this point in time, you know, the curb appeal in this community isn't what it once was. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5481.787s">And</a> we need to start investing money back in our infrastructure so that our curb appeal <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5486.758s">can</a> be something that's enticing, so that a curb appeal can be something that when a taxpayer looks out their window, they can be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5493.064s">Instead</a> of having to call C-Click fix, they can smile and tell their friends, why don't you come over and take a look at what a great job they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5498.429s">I</a> will say this, the plowing that's been done in the community over the past year or so has been excellent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5504.375s">But</a> with that being said, the toll that's taken on our roads is beginning to show. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5510.61s">So</a> with that being said, I'm requesting that the administration adjust the capital plan to take into consideration our aging infrastructure and roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5518.317s">With</a> 10 miles a year, it would still take us 14 years to resurface each roadway in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5524.142s">So</a> it's an ambitious goal, Mr. President, but I feel as though we need to do something more ambitious than 12 streets over six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5531.569s">That</a> coupled with the fact that we've been talking about ways to generate revenue in this community, to generate new growth, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5536.748s">to</a> address the $5 to $8 million budget deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5539.61s">We've</a> been discussing the revitalization of Method Square now since the 100-year parade when I was in the fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5546.635s">And</a> we had a great opportunity to address some concerns along Mystic Gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5551.338s">And</a> I think that that's kind of fallen by the wayside after all the work that the Metropolitan Area Planning Council has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5556.921s">I'm</a> very happy of the work that we've been able to do with Mr. Barbrowski. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5560.164s">And</a> once we get this recodification process <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5564.18s">completed,</a> I look forward to moving forward and hopefully securing the zoning consultant for further review of our zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5570.785s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution. <a

thing that everybody in this community uses is our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5583.874s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5723.639s">The</a> way I look at it, Mr. President, is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5725.279s">The</a> plan's been released. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5726.66s">The</a> plan is the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5727.66s">The</a> mayor didn't involve us in the planning procedure, in the planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5732.221s">This</a> council, week in and week out, sends the administration requests in the form of resolutions, making requests and recommendations as to where money should be invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5741.963s">This</a> proposal right here falls in line with the votes that the council's taken in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5745.957s">I</a> understand where he's coming from, but I respectfully decline. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5749.079s">I'd</a> like to have the paper be voted on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5750.72s">I'd</a> like to see the capital plan addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5752.641s">I've</a> had enough of the condition of these roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5754.702s">I've</a> been banging on this table since I got elected, talking about public utilities coming in this community, tearing up our streets, about what we're gonna do to come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5762.346s">And</a> we're not getting anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5765.068s">Now</a> we have a capital investment plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5766.929s">We</a> have a CIP and it doesn't address our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5770.291s">So</a> if the council is taking these votes and we're serious about the votes we've taken, <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5773.433s">And</a> there are many other items that are going to be priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5775.614s">I</a> certainly don't feel as though that's an incorrect statement to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5778.715s">And</a> I certainly understand that Councilor Marks has some priorities that he's fighting for as does Councilor Scarpelli and so Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5784.398s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, the paper that's before us is to ask that the capital plan be adjusted to call for these things as year one priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5792.461s">Any</a> further putting it off is going to put us into year two. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5794.842s">There</a> won't be year one priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5796.863s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5800.498s">It</a> is what it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5802.078s">The</a> mayor released the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5803.278s">We</a> asked for an opportunity to have involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5805.519s">That</a> opportunity wasn't afforded or awarded to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5807.739s">So</a> now we gotta do what we gotta do to get in there what we think is important for our constituents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5813.4s">This</a> is the approach I'd like to take in doing it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5815.541s">I'd</a> like to be put on record knowing that I support resurfacing of our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5820.421s">Again,</a> it's something that everybody in this community uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5822.602s">It's</a> something that everybody in this community needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5824.502s">And</a> the quality there right now is awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5827.082s">So</a> with that being said, I respectfully decline the gentleman's request <a href="https://youtu.be/8GLOO-_Tbro&t=5830.646s">at</a> this point in time, I feel.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qSI3HeMHz3A/2024-11-19_qSI3HeMHz3A.html">City Council 03-02-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=141.527s">That's</a> why I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=144.73s">Council</a> paper 21078 offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=149.514s">Be</a> it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that we reach out to one of the owners of the 630 Fellsway Plaza, Kimco Corporation to meet with the city council on the placement of collection bins on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=161.485s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=374.314s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=375.714s">This</a> is a resolution that I raised last year prior to the pandemic, and then the pandemic struck, and we were faced with a lot of fiscal uncertainty. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=384.213s">It's</a> apparent that that fiscal uncertainty still lingers over our head now, and I don't think that those circumstances are going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=391.354s">But</a> Mr. President, what I'm asking the mayor to do is to put forward a zero-based budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=396.655s">Instead</a> of continuing the trend of using last year as a reference point, to have each department start with zero and build a budget from the ground up, a budget that will be based upon measurables and goals, and will have <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=411.372s">every</a> expense justified based upon its funding mechanism, its impact, and its prioritization to the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=417.257s">I</a> think we're at a point now where we're still working off McGlynn One budget that's been traditionally budgeted as a reference point year in and year out now for the better part of three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=428.406s">And</a> it's time, Mr. President, that we take a look at our priorities, our spending in the way that we budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=433.15s">and</a> change the way we do it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=435.451s">I</a> think that this is something that needs to be looked at and the traditional way of budgeting where we use last year as a reference point and build upon that without measuring whether or not we've attained the goals that we've set our sights upon, whether or not we're seeing that the money that we've invested is giving us the most bang for the buck and whether or not we're meeting the measurables that are defined the previous year, I think is very important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=461.358s">And</a> in zero-based budgeting, every year you have to show that your expenses were justified, that you've made an impact, and that your prioritizations remained in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=470.821s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=474.041s">We're</a> gonna be facing very uncertain fiscal times, and I, as one member of this board, do not feel comfortable relying on more than 80% of our reserves, using more than 80% of our reserves to balance next year's fiscal budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=487.545s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues for support. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=491.083s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=491.924s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1135.818s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1137.279s">We</a> had a great presentation last week from the administration relative to their vision for a C-Click Fixed Program here in the community, something I'm very excited about. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1146.044s">I</a> think it's about time that we started using data to drive our decision-making when it comes to delivering services here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1153.594s">And</a> when you look at what this council's done over the past term, in terms of getting data and getting information, it's necessary for us to make good decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1164.122s">You</a> know, we've moved to require that the administration provides us with monthly warrant articles, so we know where money's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1170.587s">We're</a> requiring the administration to present before us quarterly updates on the financials, so we know what fiscal condition we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1175.951s">And</a> quarterly updates on C-Click fixed data, I think, Mr. President, goes hand in hand with those two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1183.464s">what</a> exactly it is, the types and levels of service that the people out there in the community are seeking right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1189.227s">It</a> also highlights what we're good at and what we're bad at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1193.249s">Now,</a> if we were a multi-million dollar for profit corporation, I'd say that our goal is to make profits, but we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1199.993s">Our</a> goal as a government entity is to deliver services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1204.075s">And</a> I think it's safe to say the city of Medford is not great at delivering services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1208.657s">We</a> lag behind our neighboring communities when it comes to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1213.876s">I</a> think that putting our money where our mouth is is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1217.458s">In</a> order for us to do that, we need the appropriate data and information before us to make well-informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1222.862s">And</a> I think that quarterly updates, quarterly data reports from C-Click Fix will allow us the opportunity to have more information in front of us when it comes down to making those difficult financial decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1234.069s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1236.971s">It</a> falls in line with the practice of open and transparent checkbook that we've supported all term long. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1242.985s">and</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1340.623s">I</a> as one member of this body could care less as long as we get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1343.646s">I</a> think the person that we really need to ask that question to sits across the hall as to when they're willing, able and ready to provide us with this information, some of which we fight tooth and nail to receive.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1399.793s">Mr.</a> President, I've moved to amend the paper to insert the following language, on a schedule sufficient to councilor Falco's liking. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1408.277s">I</a> like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1408.698s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1457.707s">We</a> can get a monthly too. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1458.707s">I</a> think it's a click of a button from the way they made it sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1460.989s">It</a> was going to be very easy reporting techniques. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1462.81s">So</a> we get the Warren articles monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1464.952s">I</a> don't see why we couldn't get this report monthly as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1573.444s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1575.325s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1577.527s">I,</a> too, go way back with the Wells family, Peter and Mary. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1581.31s">Peter</a> is Herbie's brother and I <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1584.127s">We've</a> been close friends for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1585.747s">His</a> niece and nephew, Brian and Julie, and I are very close as well growing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1589.688s">And</a> I had the pleasure and luck of having Mr. Wells as my sixth grade teacher at Brooks Arms Elementary School, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1597.029s">And</a> I'll just tell you what a gentleman he was, a great teacher, great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1601.31s">He</a> was someone that was willing to pull you aside and teach you the values of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1604.611s">Someone</a> that wasn't just a classroom teacher, but went a little bit above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1608.091s">Someone</a> that, you know, was really a mentor and someone that could help out someone that was on the wrong path. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1613.503s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, he'll certainly be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1617.324s">You</a> know, one thing I think that everybody who ever worked with Mr. Wells would say is that he was a hard worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1623.125s">I</a> think when he retired, he might have had, what, one or two days absent in his whole career as a teacher in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1629.786s">Never</a> missed a day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1631.327s">Never</a> missed a day of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1632.247s">He</a> came in every day and he did it because it was for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1634.587s">And</a> he was just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1636.248s">He</a> died very unexpectedly in his golden years down in Florida, Mr. President, while he was enjoying his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1642.163s">as</a> a snowbird. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1642.844s">So</a> that being said, I support the resolution and your commentary as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1949.387s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1950.668s">I'm</a> just thinking about this, and as Councilor Scarpelli is making his presentation, I'm picturing in my head, you know, where this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1957.271s">And,</a> you know, having worked at La Conte Skating Rink for a while, and, you know, having been able to whip the Zamboni around the ice down there a little bit back in my heyday, one of the things that always amazed me was how much it costs to operate these facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1971.158s">You</a> know, the electrical bill at La Conte Rink is like $30,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1975.561s">Imagine</a> if we were able to put these solar carports in, <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1978.26s">between</a> La Conte and Homel and generate enough electricity to pay the electric bill at La Conte and for the lights at Homel. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1984.144s">It's</a> a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1985.105s">It's</a> a win-win, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=1986.125s">So,</a> you know, I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this on, for putting this on, and I'm put in support of it wholeheartedly this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2218.37s">Thank</a> you, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2220.951s">Mr.</a> President, I can remember the charter school debate being raised when I worked on Beacon Hill with Senator Shannon, when they first came around. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2229.693s">And</a> this has always been an ongoing <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2232.57s">back</a> and forth charter schools public schools yes charter schools and public schools, how come they're not funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2237.834s">The</a> same way that public schools are funded then how come an assessment is levied upon the community, which participates. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2242.877s">I</a> appreciate Council based measure and I move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2246.66s">I</a> think it's a great idea Mr. President to reach out to our state delegation and let them know this is something that's really negatively impacting our budget, and the way that we operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2255.246s">I</a> don't think it's fair that you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2257.372s">We</a> have to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, but the assessment continues to go down, down, down, down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2262.513s">I'm</a> sorry, the assessment continues to rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2265.374s">There</a> has to be some sort of balance and some sort of permanent solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2268.595s">This</a> has been a discussion and debate that's been going on for now, it's been about 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2272.675s">And</a> our legislature still hasn't been able to solve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2277.036s">So</a> with that being said, a whole harmless provision is something that's necessary at this point in time, Mr. President, to support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2282.038s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2733.459s">Mr.</a> President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2734.96s">You</a> know, six of one doesn't the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2736.721s">I</a> took an opportunity to read over the state legislation that was offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2741.163s">A</a> couple of things, you know, it's the bill, the legislative session just started a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2746.486s">The</a> bill was just filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2747.186s">It</a> doesn't even have a bill number yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2749.447s">Normally</a> in my experience, I haven't worked in the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2752.049s">Nothing</a> comes out the way it goes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2755.21s">So</a> I don't know if the council wants to monitor the progress <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2759.126s">of</a> the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2759.986s">There's</a> going to be assignment to a committee, testimony, so on and so forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2765.749s">A</a> letter like this is great, but if we really want to do something, why wouldn't we monitor it? <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2771.933s">And</a> then send letters when the time is right, when testimony is being solicited from the public, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2779.597s">I</a> get a little wary of having the mentioned city council sign on to pieces of state legislation every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2787.552s">With</a> that being said, I have no problem supporting the paper this evening, but I think it's a little early in the game when we're looking at this, Mr. President, to have bills that don't even have bill numbers yet, docket numbers that haven't been introduced to a subcommittee yet in the state legislature for us to be jumping on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2804.0s">We</a> have a representative democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2805.361s">We</a> elect representatives in the state house to represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2809.623s">Let's</a> give them an opportunity to do that, give them a little bit of breathing room, maybe pick up the phone and call them, see if they'll sign on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2815.47s">before</a> taking such a public action. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2817.351s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this evening, based upon the paper that's before us, I really see it as a whole harmless provision if we support it or don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=2825.497s">I'm</a> sure I'll support it this evening, but moving forward, it's something that I would be wary of.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3500.544s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3501.985s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3503.285s">Yes,</a> it's always been my understanding that local elected bodies were exempt from the governor's executive order and that we were always <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3514.101s">warranted</a> the ability to meet in person, provided that we work within the guidelines, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3519.465s">Number</a> two, I do think it's important to point out that since this body has begun to meet in person, we've been very productive, more so than we were when we were working in a telecommuting fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3532.974s">So</a> I thank Councilor Scapelli for putting a resolution on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3539.219s">Being</a> a frontline worker, Mr. President, I welcome anybody <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3543.054s">who</a> wants to come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3543.976s">I'm</a> here to do the people's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3545.759s">I'm</a> here for the people, not for the cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3547.823s">So</a> that means that we have to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3549.928s">We</a> have to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3550.549s">So</a> I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3551.491s">And</a> I thank Councilor Scott Feller for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=3553.555s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4379.534s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4381.114s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4383.096s">That</a> information that the Councilor speaks of is a direct result of the work that this Council has done in ensuring that Eversource is brought to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4391.141s">The</a> administration had nothing to do with ensuring that we got bi-monthly and bi-weekly updates during the construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4397.204s">That</a> was something this Council did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4399.225s">I</a> can remember when this project was first introduced back, I think it was in 2015, and Councilor Marks, way ahead of the curve on this one, was demanding that Eversource come down to the city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4410.794s">I</a> believe they brought, Mr. Bill Zamparelli was here before us on multiple occasions, before they even got a grant of location or a permit to put a shovel in the ground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4420.161s">And</a> they had a gentleman by the name of Sean Shortell was his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4425.145s">And</a> Sean is the community outreach liaison who is working <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4429.032s">on</a> the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4430.173s">And</a> I believe the last update that we received from him was right around in between Christmas and between Halloween and Thanksgiving, Mr. President, that said that the work would resume in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4441.041s">And</a> that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4441.862s">But</a> I think Councilor Scott is probably on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4443.783s">We</a> haven't heard in a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4444.804s">It's</a> time to come back to the table and tell us exactly what's going on, provide us with the construction schedule, and let's get this project moving so that we can go back to some sense of normalcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4455.692s">That</a> coupled with the fact that we have a commitment from <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4458.848s">have</a> a source when this project's done to resurface our roadways from curb to curb, to fix the Winter Tree Rotary and the mess that was left behind when the water pipeline project was done there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4467.292s">I</a> think we're gonna see a lot more construction in that area before it's over, but the final product will be something that is well worth the wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4475.457s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I look forward to seeing another source here in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4479.058s">I</a> share many of the concerns that not only my colleagues, but most importantly, my neighbors share, and I look forward to having the opportunity to have them addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qSI3HeMHz3A&t=4486.302s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3363.7s">Councilor,</a> Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3365.842s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3367.102s">This</a> matter has been before our body on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3372.168s">We</a> took a look at it and we had some concern as to whether or not the city council should be approving an application for a permit where the entity would be doing business on school property. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3382.975s">And</a> we asked the school committee take a look through the application report back to us, whether or not it falls within their fundraising policy criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3392.501s">And</a> looking at the applicant that's before us personally, I'm not too crazy about the idea of doing business with them, but I don't wanna stand in the way of the PTO getting the fundraiser <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3402.175s">under</a> their belt. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3403.556s">I</a> wouldn't necessarily call this a fundraiser, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3406.119s">I</a> would call it the food truck provider jacking up their prices 16% and that 16% of sales being donated back to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3415.729s">I</a> don't think that that's quite in the spirit of philanthropy. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3419.332s">However,</a> as I stated, I don't want to get in the way of the PTO conducting <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3426.83s">a</a> fundraiser or an event to bring excitement about the return to their school and to raise much-needed funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3434.516s">So,</a> Mr. President, my concern now lies on the fact that we have an entity coming into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3440.44s">They've</a> asked for permits in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3441.641s">We've</a> denied them permitting in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3444.343s">They're</a> now pursuing permitting through our PTOs in our public schools, through our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3451.888s">My</a> concern is that this PTO fundraiser is no more than a data mining initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3457.289s">where</a> they're going to be able to get people's personal information, emails, and the like, and then use that to begin a marketing campaign in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3465.334s">So</a> I certainly have no problem approving this paper this evening for the simple fact that it's for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3473.539s">However,</a> I would like there to be requirements that no personal information or data be retained by the applicants following the conclusion of the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3484.885s">Once</a> they get paid, the party's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3486.968s">And</a> they're not going to be taking email addresses and emailing individuals in the community saying, do you want to be an ambassador? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3492.592s">Do</a> you want to have a food truck on your street? <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3495.635s">Use</a> that as a form of solicitation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3498.817s">You</a> know, to jack your prices up 18% and call that philanthropy and donation, I don't quite see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3505.482s">In</a> my world, when you give, you give. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3508.244s">Sometimes</a> that comes right off the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3509.625s">You</a> know, jack your prices up and then pass off your jacked up profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3514.709s">They</a> call that fundraising. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3516.62s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would move that the paper be approved with the following conditions, that no personal data be utilized or retained by the applicant following the conclusion of the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3528.344s">Thank</a> you, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/CEBUcuE3cuo&t=3529.184s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4/2024-11-19_3v7haMF7rG4.html">City Council 02-16-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=618.023s">I</a> appreciate you reading this into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=621.466s">Very</a> recently, I received an email with a post indicating that the Benford Historic Commission was seeking applicants to fill a vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=631.815s">And</a> at first glance, I looked at it and I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=635.31s">That's</a> no big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=637.111s">And</a> then I went on to read the requirements of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=640.812s">And</a> I have some talking points on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=644.094s">The</a> historic commission is calling for letters of intent for interested parties to join their commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=650.517s">Applicants</a> should have an interest knowledge and experience in fields related to historic preservation and method history. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=656.179s">And</a> they may contact the commission for further information. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=659.701s">Candidates</a> may be contacted by the commission for an interview <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=663.07s">and</a> the commission shall then present a list of nominees to the mayor for final selection and appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=669.494s">And</a> this struck me as odd, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=671.335s">The</a> way the boards and commissions are filled usually doesn't operate in this fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=680.441s">The</a> composition, appointment, powers, and duties of the commission are outlined by statute, by general law, chapter 40, section 8D. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=689.147s">And</a> nowhere in that <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=692.273s">legislative</a> act, does it provide the commission with human resource authority or selection power? <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=697.656s">That</a> power is the exclusive purview of the mayor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=701.898s">So</a> when I look at the commission seeking to attain letters of intent to then screen applicants to then send it to the mayor for who's going to be appointed, it becomes concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=716.104s">It's</a> a clear overreach of the authority that's outlined in the statute, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=720.363s">And</a> it's problematic from a human resource perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=724.125s">A</a> member of a board of commission, once appointed, becomes a city employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=728.007s">And</a> that opens a city up to certain liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=732.03s">When</a> you're applying for a position on a board or a commission, the process should be open, transparent, but you should also be very cognizant of workers' rights and the applicants' rights, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=741.135s">I</a> don't think that the board of commission has the technical expertise to ensure that the city's liabilities aren't going to be at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=750.548s">Further,</a> when a board of commission is the screening entity to select members of its own board of commission, creates the impression that this becomes a good old boys club, a network where you have to be a friend of the board in order to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=767.259s">The</a> mayor was the person that was vested with this authority through statute for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=771.582s">It's</a> so that we can have a diverse board that represents various aspects and walks of life in our community that have concern and interest over our historic preservation <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=779.765s">So</a> I thought that that was very concerning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=783.986s">And</a> the biggest, most concerning part of it is that, you know, certain applications will never reach the mayor's desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=790.967s">The</a> commission will interview individuals and then they will send to the mayor who they feel should be appointed after their screening process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=798.368s">So</a> that raises some concerns relative to record retention and the like that surround the municipal government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=804.65s">So</a> with that being said, I'm asking that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=807.432s">the</a> administration report to us what their hiring practices, what their policy is, and take a look into this issue that's going on with the historic commission because I feel as though number one, it's a extreme overreach of the statutory authority, number one, and number two, opens the city up to liabilities related to the human resource world and also records retention and other criteria that behest upon a professional administration related to the implementation of human resource policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=833.859s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=837.76s">Um,</a> you know, and looking at it, I feel as though it's somewhat odd that a border commission would try to handpick the members that they're going to serve with and the members that they're going to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=849.071s">I</a> think that that's problematic and I don't think that that was the intent of the state statute that was passed when it was enacted here in the city of Medford to establish a historic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=858.139s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=882.015s">I</a> certainly have no problem with that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=883.836s">I</a> do believe we look back in our package four weeks, four and a half weeks, five weeks ago, I believe we did get a copy of the list of the boards of commission, but I have no problem asking for that again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=896.175s">Chief</a> of Staff Rodriguez.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=966.022s">Mr.</a> President, through you to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=967.562s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=968.342s">Through</a> you to the gentleman, Mr. President, that was our case in point when we were speaking about some of our appointments that the council has authority for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=975.363s">We</a> requested that the administration provide us with any applicants that expressed interest in the Mel commission, for example, because I was under the impression that they had a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=984.145s">So</a> this is just something I want to make sure that I'm able <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=986.105s">without</a> a rise across it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=987.085s">It's</a> a slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=989.607s">And</a> I appreciate the chief of staff for his willingness to investigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=994.169s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=995.31s">Councilor</a> Belco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1114.949s">Withdrawn</a> the paper, Mr. President, the administration not provided that information prior to the meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1125.158s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, the administration has established the Cannabis Advisory Commission meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1130.743s">They</a> kicked off just last week, I believe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1140.751s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, that was related to the Board of Health, and the administration has put out a couple of new hotline numbers related to COVID vaccine response and coronavirus response. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1151.681s">I</a> did have a difficult time <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1153.967s">reaching</a> the individual on the phone there last week, I called over 30 times and did not get a live operator. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1158.669s">But</a> it appears that the administration's cognizant of the high volume of calls that are going through the office and have taken appropriate steps to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=1164.991s">So</a> I have no issue here.

href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2725.09s">As</a> I had stated earlier in the meeting, the Cannabis Advisory Commission has been meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2729.333s">You</a> know, today at 530, we met and we talked about the financial circumstances surrounding our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2735.577s">We're</a> looking at anywhere between a five and a half and $8 million structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2740.56s">And</a> we need to come up with ways to generate revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2744.102s">And</a> one of those ways that we can generate these revenues, Mr. President, is by enacting the voter approved <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2752.437s">marijuana</a> dispensaries here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2755.117s">And</a> on the 11th, I did understand there was a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2759.058s">I</a> logged into the meeting and I watched a portion of it, and it did raise some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2764.479s">This</a> council, when it met and crafted the ordinance for the Cannabis Advisory Commission, did so in a fashion that was very cognizant of number one, the mayor's reported conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2777.821s">Number</a> two, keeping politics out of the selection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2782.18s">And</a> number three, ensuring that through the screening and application process, the entities that are going to be responsible for regulating these type of businesses in the community would have a large say in who gets to get a good score going forward to negotiate a host community agreement with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2801.532s">The</a> administration seemed to have quite a hands-on role in the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2806.215s">It's</a> a little bit concerning to me because the legislative intent was to keep the administration separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2811.23s">And</a> the reason the council structured it that way was because the administration is going to be responsible for negotiating the host community agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2818.595s">So</a> the administration was kind enough to provide us with the materials that were presented at the 2-11 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2826.439s">The</a> 2-11 meeting wasn't called by the commission, it was called by the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2829.962s">That's</a> like us calling a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2831.583s">We're</a> the city council, we're not the school committee, we can't call a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2835.325s">The</a> Cannabis Advisory Council has an outline responsibility in the ordinance, it's a duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2840.937s">that</a> they have to follow through with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2843.118s">And</a> in looking at the materials that have been submitted, I haven't had a chance to give it a good glance because it was sitting on my desk when I got in here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2852.74s">But</a> it appears that they have put forward a proposed scoring system that adds weight to certain criteria more so than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2865.904s">And</a> I think that's really determination that the Canvas Advisory Commission should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2870.053s">Um,</a> so I'm a little concerned about how this is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2872.874s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think the biggest concern that everybody has in here is that the mayor has this conflict of interest that she's expressed time and time again when it comes down to the issue of implementing the will of the voters and creating legislation that would authorize the marijuana dispensaries here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2889.857s">Um,</a> so at this point in time, Mr. President, I'd just like to ask the administration to disclose <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2894.772s">their</a> conflict of interest to provide the council with a copy of the conflict of interest opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2898.895s">Um,</a> that's a public documents, public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2901.216s">Um,</a> so that maybe some of these concerns could be set to rest because, uh, one of the biggest things that we want to ensure Mr. President is that we do this the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2908.6s">And</a> the last thing we want is people in orange jumpsuits when this is all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2912.463s">Um,</a> so with that being said, you know, I want to make sure that everything's done about bar, um, and that, you know, every individual gets a fair shake. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2918.887s">It</a> does apply investment application. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2921.517s">And</a> understanding what this conflict of interest is, I think will be very helpful in us in alleviating some of our fears and concerns moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2929.282s">The</a> administration has made quite a pledge to transparency throughout many press releases and campaign pledges that have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2936.607s">And</a> I see that that transparency pledge should apply here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2939.969s">It</a> should be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2941.17s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to approve the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2945.192s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=2946.133s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3412.715s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=3414.096s">Mr.</a> President, I too, as the alternate to the gaming commission, will be joining you in a recusal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4461.831s">Mr.</a> President, before we move on, I'd just like to take an opportunity to recognize the work of traffic engineer Todd Blake and his assistants in getting a couple of signs on the corner of Winthrop Street and South Street removed at the request of a constituent last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4478.592s">He</a> and I have been going back and forth for a few weeks trying to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4481.353s">And</a> I just wanted to thank him for his hard work and his effort in making sure that it became a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4485.475s">So</a> I wanted to point out a job well done by our traffic engineer in response to a constituent concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3v7haMF7rG4&t=4494.578s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Vice President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM/2024-11-19_DNuiAY3aRNM.html">City Council 02-09-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=309.743s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to take an opportunity to recognize the work that this council has done on this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=315.071s">This</a> came to us some time ago when there were some concerns over the composition thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=322.603s">document</a> that was creating a commission that was comprised of mainly individuals that didn't have a reflection or an involvement with our public schools, with our local experts in public health coming out of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital Hallmark Health Area or Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=339.534s">And</a> through a number of meetings, a number of hours of deliberation, discussion, and debate, we were able to come up with this document that I think is reflective of the needs <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=348.74s">of</a> the behavioral health concerns in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=351.102s">I</a> think it's going to put us in a better place than we are today with this passage, and I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=356.186s">I'd</a> just like to take this opportunity to recognize the work of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=359.288s">I</a> think we had over 10 meetings on this one document that's before us here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=364.272s">I</a> don't want individuals to think that it's being rushed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=366.814s">This</a> is something that we took a long and hard look at and took a long time vetting, and it's something that I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=372.959s">I'm</a> very grateful that we were able to get it completed, and I ask my council colleagues to support it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=377.801s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=861.821s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=863.302s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=864.723s">This</a> is an item that had come up for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=866.965s">This</a> is something that this council has been working on for more than one term. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=870.147s">I</a> know in the past I have sponsored resolutions to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=873.489s">You've</a> sponsored resolutions to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=875.05s">Councilor</a> Marks has as well, if my memory serves me correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=878.932s">I</a> do believe Councilor Falco and Scarpelli have also sponsored amendments or resolutions going forward to address the unattended donation collection bins in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=889.582s">All</a> of us have been contacted by residents that live over by Fellsway Plaza, live over by the mall, and other areas where these donation bins are located. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=898.59s">And</a> in some circumstances, they can become rather unsightly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=903.434s">The</a> ordinance was a well thought out ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=905.415s">It</a> allows us to continue our textile recycling programs that our school PTOs be using for fundraising efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=912.94s">It</a> allows us to properly address quality of life issues in the neighborhood with proper call numbers and information provided to residents when they have a complaint or a concern who's occupying or operating the donation collection bin and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=929.151s">So</a> this is a great ordinance that provides safeguards to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=931.953s">And</a> it's something I'm very proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=933.274s">I</a> thank my council colleagues for the hard work that they've put on it, and I'm glad to see this finally come to fruition.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1219.273s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's very important to point out that what this road and control ordinance does is it requires that there's an individual pest management program for permittees that are receiving permits for dumpsters, permits for food establishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1233.43s">Permits</a> for transfer and recycling facilities, keeping animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1237.893s">Also</a> permits for public property, individuals that are coming in our community to open our streets and provide construction services. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1244.316s">Also,</a> individuals that are composting in their backyards, and that's something that we've heard a lot about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1250.219s">Individuals</a> that have seen rodent problems due to composting and the way that composting has been handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1256.322s">And</a> this puts some regulations in here that allow us to continue composting in the community, but put some safeguards in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1261.669s">And</a> that's something that I'm very glad that the council supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1264.872s">So</a> with that being said, I do thank them for supporting that amendment that I added, and I move approval as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1269.595s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1455.496s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1456.656s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1458.136s">This</a> paper was passed by the state legislature and signed by the governor into law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1461.978s">And</a> it has a requirement that says that MBTA communities must have a high density zoning district within close proximity to their MBTA station, one MBTA station in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1473.206s">I</a> believe that it's 15 units per one acre is the defined basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1479.05s">So</a> I'd just like to ask this question to the city solicitor as to whether or not we're in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1483.068s">The</a> reason I ask the question is because this council is going through a rigorous process of recodifying our zoning right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1490.156s">Earlier</a> this evening, we talked about housing production plan that the administration is working on with private consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1497.563s">And</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that we take into consideration <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1501.387s">perspective</a> all of the new changes that have happened at the state level to ensure that we're in compliance and that we're not spending money on consultants and studies and doing so not complying with the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1514.773s">So</a> with that being said, it's just a request for information to ensure that as we move forward as a council in addressing our zoning here in the community, that we're doing so with the proper legal guidance and information necessary to make informed and wise decisions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1566.982s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1568.123s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli is also a co-sponsor of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1572.445s">Many</a> of us know the Mosher family from the fine meals that we've all received when we cross the border over into Bar Square and go to Victor's Deli. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1582.009s">And</a> I'm sure many of us have had the world famous chicken a la Rosa, or famous beef stew, or famous escarole soup, world famous calzones, steak and cheese, chicken pie, and the list goes on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1596.375s">Rosa</a> Mosher opened a restaurant with her husband Victor called Victor's Deli over in Somerville some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1601.758s">And</a> these longtime residents treated everybody like family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1605.98s">That</a> restaurant was their kitchen, and that restaurant was their home, and everyone was allowed to eat around their dinner table. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1611.821s">And</a> Rosa recently passed due to some complications with her health. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1615.563s">And</a> having recently retired from Victor's and passing the business on to her son Michael, who has expanded it to the Ball Square Cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1624.166s">He's</a> been taking up some of Rosa's recipes and delivering them to the public over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1627.988s">But</a> Rosa recently passed, and she's someone that's touched so many people's lives, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1633.37s">I've</a> been going to Victor's Deli for as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1635.852s">Every</a> Saturday morning in high school, we'd go down there and get chicken parm subs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1639.517s">Rosa</a> would greet us with a big smile, and she'd put the order in before we even walked through the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1644.039s">When</a> you're short a couple of bucks, she was the first person to look the other way and tell you to get out the door before her husband caught you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1649.762s">She</a> was a very, very kind person, a very warm soul, and she was someone that I was very lucky to have been able to forge a friendship with through patronizing her business, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1662.129s">Long</a> time Medford resident, I've had the opportunity of <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1666.278s">becoming</a> great friends with her son, Michael, and her daughter, Nancy, over the years, all through the restaurant, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1671.022s">So</a> it's just amazing what a small business in the community can do to bring so many people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1675.846s">And</a> Victor's Deli was really <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1677.938s">one</a> of those types of places where, whether you're from Medford or Somerville, the door was always open and people were always there gathering, meeting, having a laugh, sharing a sandwich, and, you know, just really getting to know each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1688.67s">It's</a> a place that we had a great sense of community, and that was because of the way that Rosa ran her business and the type of person that she was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1697.399s">Her</a> business was no different than her home. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1698.841s">The</a> door was always open. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1700.222s">And</a> she's someone, Mr. President, that's touched me over the years greatly with her humor and her kindness. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1707.124s">And</a> she's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1709.884s">At</a> the risk of babbling on any further, I will rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1713.545s">But</a> it's something that I certainly believe deserves some recognition this evening, is the service that Rose has done to the community in Victor's Deli. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1720.997s">all</a> that they've done for people here in the city of Medford, so I'd ask that the council support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=1725.158s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2093.609s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2094.929s">In</a> recent weeks we've seen our <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2097.917s">Colleagues</a> in government on the school committee's broadcasts providing closed captioning services. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2103.981s">Our</a> human rights commission has discussed the city council's potential to expand the way that we communicate with people, whether it be through translation services, closed captioning services, and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2117.33s">I</a> think, Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2120.952s">It's</a> to ask that our director of community media provide us with a cost estimate for closed captioning services. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2125.956s">So</a> that once we get that back, we can take the appropriate and necessary steps to ensure that it is provided during our broadcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=2132.086s">I</a> yield the floor to Councilor Falco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3551.307s">This</a> council has <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3554.013s">We've</a> been requesting the city's vaccination plan since December 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3559.654s">Since</a> before Christmas, we've been asking what the vaccination plan is and what direction we're going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3567.036s">It's</a> unfortunate that at our state level of government, we have been unable to get this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3574.758s">I</a> think it's sad, Mr. President, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3578.587s">We</a> look at a congressperson being elevated to one of the more powerful positions in the US House. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3587.81s">I</a> call on the mayor to reach out to our colleagues in government that represent us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3591.991s">Because</a> if we're 44th in the country in the distribution of vaccinations, but we are, as Councilor Mark said, the premier provider of health institutions in the world, there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3602.495s">There's</a> something wrong, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3604.615s">And</a> every day that goes by, someone else dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3607.797s">Every</a> day that goes by, someone else dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3609.559s">I</a> really don't want weekly updates about what we're going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3613.884s">I</a> want a vaccination plan in place where we're actually have boots on the ground, needles going in arms and people getting vaccinated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3622.514s">Did</a> we not know that there was going to be a vaccination at some point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3628.382s">I</a> think we all knew there was going to be a vaccination. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3630.264s">I</a> think we maybe focused a little bit too much on testing and a little bit less on a solution to the problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3637.09s">And</a> here we are now, almost two months later from our initial request for a vaccination plan, and we still don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3644.657s">And</a> that's problematic, Mr. President, because if the council is asking for the vaccination plan, it's because we know it's a pressing need in this community because we've all heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3654.227s">So</a> I support my council colleagues in figuring out what's going on, because we need to get the appropriate and sufficient amount of doses to address our high need community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3667.973s">And</a> as Councilor Marks has stated a number of times in the past, Medford has a high number of senior citizens that reside in this community, higher than the state average. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3678.137s">So</a> with that being said, we should be a priority community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3681.372s">looking</a> at the number of individuals that we have that would fall into the high risk categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3685.913s">So</a> with that being said, I support, I support my colleagues and moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3689.594s">I</a> don't want updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3690.395s">I</a> want action. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3691.135s">I</a> want a vaccination plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3692.795s">But</a> you know, I think that the public needs to be informed in a better fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=3696.436s">And</a> I do have all the faith in the world and Jackie Peaks and her ability in the communication office to put together a comprehensive communication strategy that will meet that goal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4030.564s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4031.925s">I</a> also echo Councilor Falco's sentiments concerning City Solicitor Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4036.868s">I've</a> known City Solicitor Scanlon now going back what feels like 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4040.069s">We</a> went to high school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4041.51s">She's</a> a very capable person. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4042.771s">I</a> know her very well personally and professionally, and I think she's doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4048.674s">This</a> item came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4050.479s">last</a> year is one of our council priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4053.24s">And</a> in the committee of the whole that we have, the administration talked about this great new contract that they were going to be executing with a firm called KP Law, who based upon the bills I've received from the administration, we still haven't paid, or been billed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4069.708s">But</a> one of the biggest things, I think, Mr. President, to promote a successful relationship between an attorney and a client is trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4079.104s">And</a> KP Law came before us and we asked them the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4083.241s">Who's</a> your boss? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4084.301s">Are</a> you working for the city council right now, or are you working for the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4087.143s">They</a> said, we're working for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4088.463s">We're</a> just giving the city council advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4091.545s">I</a> don't think that trust is there with KP Law, with this group, with this council in KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4095.606s">I</a> just don't think we have that trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4097.727s">And</a> quite frankly, we're a very productive council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4100.568s">As</a> Councilor Falco pointed out, we pumped out three ordinances tonight for first reading, but we didn't just pump them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4106.751s">Those</a> took years, I mean literal years, for us to finally get to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4111.373s">And</a> I think we'd be able to enhance our levels of productivity if we had the necessary technical expertise and support on issues like zoning, the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4123.697s">The</a> drafting of ordinances, the compliance with Chapter 40A, the crafting of requests for information from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4131.099s">Because</a> sometimes I feel like we spend more time asking for information that we're entitled to than we do about actually working on the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4138.24s">And</a> more importantly, Mr. President, we'll have somebody here that will help us ensure compliance with the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4144.901s">Everybody</a> on this board took an oath. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4147.943s">that</a> to the best of their abilities they were going to uphold the laws of the Constitution of the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the ordinances in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4155.553s">By</a> having legal counsel available handily to provide us with that technical expertise and support will be beneficial and will only make us a more productive body, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4165.736s">Number</a> two, it will make us a more productive body, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4169.617s">This</a> is something that I feel is a necessary priority for inclusion in the next fiscal year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4177.46s">As</a> we see an increasing number of matters coming before us, <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4184.082s">I</a> think it's necessary for us to ensure that we have the tools to do the job appropriately and properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4193.284s">And</a> that's why I'm going to support this resolution this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4195.925s">And</a> that's why I'm going to be very concerned if when we start our pre-budget meetings, which are coming up relatively shortly, which were also a council priority from last year, if this isn't included in some of those discussions, I'm going to have a very difficult time moving forward and supporting a budget that doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4215.074s">adequately</a> support the city council in the work and time and efforts that it puts in to meet our obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4221.296s">So</a> with that being said, I second the motion of Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4225.678s">Thank</a> you, Vice President Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4449.982s">I</a> second the amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4453.444s">Any</a> further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4454.284s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4455.685s">I</a> also, Mr. President, would like to add a B paper or a further amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4464.409s">Must</a> be 60 days ago, 75 days ago now, we requested from the administration a breakdown of the claims over accounts 5761 and 5762 outlined in our Warren articles. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4478.493s">We</a> had a discussion relative to the fact that claims over a certain dollar figure, I believe it was $2,500, were required to come by this council if there were settlements and not legal judgments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4488.318s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we still have not received that report as to what the breakdown of these claims over consists of and whether or not any of these payments were judgments or settlements that were voluntarily entered into. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4504.863s">If</a> we want to talk about transparency, then let's talk about where the money's at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4508.786s">Let's</a> follow the buck and let's see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4511.808s">I'm</a> not sure what the secret is, but I'm interested in getting to the bottom of an itemized breakdown of those two accounts so that I can better understand the inordinate number of expenditures that have gone out of that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4526.578s">Now,</a> I'm not saying there's any wrongdoing going on, but what I am saying is that based upon the dollar figures that have been expended from those accounts, that's a lot of $2,400 settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4535.528s">that</a> don't have to come before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4538.089s">So</a> that's information, I think, that's very necessary for us, Mr. President, moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4543.211s">So</a> with that being said, I would also like to add that as an amendment for- Well, a B paper is an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4549.074s">A</a> B paper is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4549.794s">It</a> would be a further request. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4551.295s">Actually,</a> I'll offer it as an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4552.995s">I</a> don't think it's an issue that we've ever voted against in the past, and I don't anticipate we'll vote against it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4557.521s">We're</a> looking for financial accountability and transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4559.942s">So</a> I don't think any member of this board is going to vote against that, because every member of this board speaks on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4564.983s">They're</a> for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4565.563s">We</a> represent that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4567.424s">So</a> with that being said, I'll offer it as an amendment, and I will ask for, again, a second time, an itemized breakdown of accounts numbers 5761 and 5762 claims over. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4578.242s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4579.042s">Councilor</a> Belko.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4642.329s">At</a> the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4643.029s">We</a> also, I believe, funded a solicitor's position and an assistant city solicitor's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4646.891s">So</a> we funded two positions, one of which has gone vacant for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=4649.632s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5100.528s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5102.449s">I</a> didn't know if you wanted to speak on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5104.69s">I'll</a> let you speak and then I'll come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5106.471s">I</a> was just going to say that the Hormel Commission's appointment has, the council's appointment to the Hormel Commission has expired for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5113.655s">And</a> the council, when the administration changed Mayor Lungo-Koehn, has been soliciting applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5121.399s">for</a> the past year for individuals seeking to serve on a board or commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5125.722s">So</a> I just ask that we would make the request from the city administration to provide us with a copy of any of the letters of intent or interest that her office has received during this year-long process of collecting and soliciting applications for our boards and commissions and provide them with the council so that we can take those applications and give them the proper review in executive session or committee of the whole or whatever process that we decide to undertake to vet them and appoint.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5273.18s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5274.841s">To</a> that point, Mr. President, if I may, vice president, I can appreciate what Councilor Marks coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5278.885s">Um,</a> and I think it's important to point out that because the Hormel commission was, um, something that was established by way of a statute through a home rule petition when we did the land transfer to get the land over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5290.235s">The</a> way that the commission is structured is statutory through the home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5295.54s">And</a> the mayor has two appointments and the council has one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5298.502s">So</a> while the mayor may not have received any applicants for individuals that wanted to serve as the council appointee, she may have received applicants for individuals that wanted to serve in the mayoral appointee positions that remain filled still within the term limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5315.815s">So</a> that's why I thought it might make sense for us to get those applications as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5368.44s">And</a> amended by me to get the mayor's... And as amended by Councilor Knight to get any applications from the mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=5723.488s">Second</a> the Councilor's motion to refer to the subcommittee, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6095.206s">Thank</a> you, Constable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6096.146s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6097.407s">Mr.</a> President, yes, as I read through this, you know, it sounds like the intent of the ordinance is to replace gas powered leaf blowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6109.043s">or</a> eliminate the use of leaf blowers entirely in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6113.706s">When</a> you look at the resolution, commercial grade gas leaf blowers can operate at high decibel levels, harmful to the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6121.731s">Well,</a> Councilor Scott probably has presented us with some data to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6124.673s">But</a> also, wouldn't an electric blower <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6129.051s">perform</a> the same exact impact if, you know, we have data that says that it's only a WISPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6134.236s">Number</a> two, commercial grade glass leaf blowers launch particulates and hazardous materials into the air at a rate of over 150 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6140.862s">And</a> the councilor went through a list of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6143.225s">I</a> think- What information- Sorry to interrupt you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6173.807s">Vice</a> President, that's what I was getting at, was that I think gas and electric blowers are going to have the same effect and the same impact when it comes to the blowing of particulates and the decibel levels of noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6188.374s">But</a> the question I ask, I guess, is that the intent to eliminate just gas-powered leaf blowers or all leaf blowers in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6196.152s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6196.592s">Number</a> two, I think it's important to point out the people that are using these gas blowers are working too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6201.594s">So</a> while someone might be trying to work from home because they're fortunate enough to have a desk job, there's an individual that's out there, a blue collar worker that's using a leaf blower, and I don't think they're using it for their health. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6212.358s">They're</a> using it as a means to provide for their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6215.959s">So</a> I guess the question is, is the intent to eliminate leaf blowers entirely? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6220.12s">Is</a> the intent to eliminate just gas leaf blowers? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6222.961s">Or</a> is the intent to study the issue?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6276.057s">I'm</a> not finished, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6278.517s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6281.838s">I</a> was just asking a question while I had the floor, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6287.32s">No,</a> I was just asking what the intent was from the sponsor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6291.441s">She</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6291.781s">I</a> have further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6294.822s">I</a> would, Mr. President, I think maybe if the intent is to study the issue, then that's what the paper should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6301.02s">Because</a> by voting for this, it looks like the council is saying, we're going to eliminate the use of all leaf blowers in the city, and let's send it to the city solicitor to draft an ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6310.848s">Be</a> it so resolved, the city council requests that the city solicitor draft language to establish an ordinance around commercial grade leaf blowers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6316.953s">Kind</a> of sounds like it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6317.833s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6318.314s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6318.394s">But</a> anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6318.954s">Same</a> thing about private law team. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6322.377s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6322.897s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6323.438s">So</a> I think it's important, Mr. President, that maybe we strike the language and replace it with, be it so resolved, that the subcommittee on energy <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6329.054s">study</a> the issue of the use of leaf blowers in the community and report back to the council its findings at a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6334.999s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6335.859s">I'd</a> offer that in the form of an amendment to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6338.181s">As</a> amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6340.603s">Councilor</a> Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6341.023s">As</a> a strike and replace.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6424.387s">So</a> in response, Mr. President, I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6429.091s">We</a> should be asking for what we want, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6431.393s">We</a> want the issue to be studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6432.795s">We're</a> saying the issue needs to be studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6434.576s">We</a> don't know whether or not creating a draft ordinance or draft language around commercial grade leaf blower use is in the best interest of this community because it hasn't been studied. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6444.645s">And</a> we talk about due diligence and we talk about vetting quite a bit when we are being critical of the person that sits in the corner office across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6451.758s">And</a> I think that if we're going to be that critical of others, we should be holding ourselves to the same standard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6457.76s">You</a> know, so with that being said, I mean, I don't think it makes sense for us to draft an ordinance that we haven't studied yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6472.638s">strike</a> and replace with be it so resolved by the Subcommittee of Energy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6707.454s">Point</a> of amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6708.715s">I</a> made an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6709.395s">She</a> can't say, no, you can't make an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=6711.276s">I</a> made an amendment to get seconded.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7316.355s">I</a> do believe that the gentleman is reinforcing our argument that this issue needs to be further studied and examined. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7323.641s">He</a> did state that this is something that needs to be looked at because there's a lot of science involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7328.065s">It</a> needs to be studied to understand the science. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7330.587s">That's</a> all this council is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7333.67s">I</a> don't think we need to go into the demographic makeup of the landscapers and the landscaping crews at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7341.517s">What</a> this is was a call for the council to study the issue that's before it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7344.699s">We</a> didn't vote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7345.42s">We</a> didn't say, no, get rid of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7346.56s">We</a> said, if you want to draft an ordinance, it needs to be studied first. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7349.843s">And</a> the study report needs to be submitted to the council for further review and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7354.305s">Bottom</a> line, that was all it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7356.087s">This</a> isn't like the thing is dead on the vine and it's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7358.568s">What</a> it's saying is it's not ripe for the drafting of an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7360.97s">And</a> we need further information in order for this council to build consensus. <a href="https://youtu.be/DNuiAY3aRNM&t=7364.072s">And</a> the way that we can do that is by having a study.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_bJDrOFPloZA/2024-11-19_bJDrOFPloZA.html">City Council 02-02-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=393.584s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=394.885s">I</a> appreciate you bearing with me and going through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=398.626s">I</a> apologize for the length of my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=402.608s">However,</a> I think it's a very important issue, and I think it's very important that we take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=408.511s">It's</a> evident that during government shutdown, Mr. President, we've all become more and more reliant upon e-commerce options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=415.671s">But</a> while e-commerce certainly has its many benefits, the adverse impacts that it's had during the pandemic upon Main Street USA is something many of the businesses here in Medford are never going to recover from. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=429.565s">And</a> the expansion of Amazon in particular is negatively impacting the well-being of our community and our local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=437.816s">Mr.</a> President, there were just a number of reported concerns that Amazon's lowering the bar concerning safety standards, misclassifying of employees, failing to pay a living wage, provide health insurance, or secure retirement prospects for their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=452.928s">And</a> quite frankly, our community's lost jobs to this mega corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=456.931s">And</a> as one of the most profitable corporations in the world, Amazon has a social responsibility to its consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=464.157s">the</a> environment of the communities that they service, and most importantly, its workers, to replace jobs lost in our community during this pandemic with opportunities that meet our current community standards and raise the bar, not lower it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=476.642s">And</a> that's not what we're receiving right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=479.183s">The</a> Medford City Council's called upon Amazon to appear before us in the past to address the concerns that we have regarding their operational practices, the way their drivers park and drive down the street, the way their drivers aren't properly quarry checked, the size of the vehicles that they're <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=493.228s">distributing</a> across our neighborhoods, Mr. President, much to the chagrin of many of the residents and the quality of life of us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=501.133s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support this resolution in calling Amazon to the carpet to address a number of concerns that we have here in the community and raising standards for living people and for working people here in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=514.34s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=516.962s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=707.589s">Any</a> further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=709.51s">One</a> more thing, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that, you know, when we talk about community standards and what we expect here in Medford for employers to do and what it takes to be a good employer, or what it takes to support the rights of workers in the community, we have to also look at the fact that this resolution does speak to asking that Local 25 be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=730.446s">And</a> when you look at local 25 the teamsters union and the work they've done related to individuals in the trucking industry and professionals in the trucking industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=738.89s">When</a> we talk about community standards, local 25 help set that bar, Mr. President, when it comes down to a fair living wage when it comes down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=746.713s">providing</a> health benefits and providing secure retirement prospects for the community, we have to look at the organizations that are in this community that provide people with jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=755.522s">And</a> Local 25 is a large employer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=758.405s">We</a> look at the work that Sean O'Brien does as president of Local 25, a Medford resident, a Medford high school grad, someone that maintains pride in his community, someone that has the blue and white running through his veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=768.295s">You</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=769.375s">We</a> have to respect the work that these individuals have done for Medford in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=773.298s">And</a> that's why I asked Local 25 to be involved in this process as we go forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=778.0s">I</a> thank President O'Brien for his leadership in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=782.963s">And</a> when I say the region, I don't mean eastern Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=788.089s">Eastern</a> United States of America, because he's really helping set the tone and set the bar and raise standards across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=794.932s">So</a> I want to take an opportunity to also thank Sean O'Brien and the work that he's doing on behalf of the residents in Medford and also across America. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=801.735s">Thank</a> you very much to Sean.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=954.717s">If</a> I may, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=956.425s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=957.746s">This</a> is just one piece in a regional approach that Local 25 is taking and working with the community stakeholders to raise the bar across the region where Amazon is looking to expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=967.714s">So</a> the next steps would be that, you know, we're going to get community support from communities surrounding Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=972.237s">Somerville</a> had a resolution on very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=975.079s">The</a> city of Boston has as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=976.901s">The</a> next step, and what my intention would be, would be to coordinate with representatives, the sponsors of those pieces of legislation, as well as the legislative arm of Local 25 <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=985.627s">to</a> begin putting pressure on a dialogue with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=988.589s">So</a> that's the next steps that I'd like to take, Mr. President, and the next steps that have been coordinated through the political arm of Local 25.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1015.102s">And</a> I mean some of the things that we can look at Mr. President would be establishing no truck zones, working with the Amazon to be sure that they understand what on resident access only means not using streets or cutthroats then also those other community standards issues that we're discussing where you know we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1033.468s">The</a> delivery driver that's coming to Medford is also going to Malden and Winchester and Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1037.051s">So</a> we want to make sure that person's properly quarry checked, properly licensed, and properly trained in the safety standards that are acceptable to us in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1046.497s">And</a> the only way that we're going to be able to do that is by coordinating locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1049.72s">And</a> then I'm taking the next steps that the stakeholders are able to establish for what they think will work in their individual community and also regionally.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1191.765s">right</a> for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1193.506s">Council</a> President Gabriela I understand that and again, like I said, the jobs that were replacing in the community should not be lowering the bar that should be raising the bar so we're taking jobs away from truck drivers we should be bringing jobs back in truck drivers that met those same community standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1207.29s">You</a> know, high-tech jobs are high-tech jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1208.891s">When</a> we're talking about blue-collar working people that need to get paid a living wage in order to survive in this community, in order to be able to live in this community, in order to have discretionary dollars that they can spend in the local economy here so that we can all rise together, I think it's very important that we focus on those jobs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1225.377s">I</a> thank my council colleague, Councilor Scarpelli, as a co-sponsor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1321.09s">Thank</a> you for that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1323.592s">Vice</a> President night for about the last seven weeks now I've been working with the city traffic set the city's traffic engineer to get a couple of signs removed on the corner of South Street, and went for up and these signs are located on that recent complete streets project that was performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1340.522s">It's</a> a cut out or a bump out right in front of the first house on the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1344.713s">And</a> the city in the, their approach to trying to mitigate traffic along South Street, put two signs up one that says 93 and the other one that says 16 right on the corner of South Street and Winthrop Street, probably arm's length distance from the <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1362.045s">If</a> you were standing on the front porch of the gentleman's home that lives on the corner, he could reach off the front porch and touch the science Mr. President, I've made multiple attempts to ask that these signs be relocated or removed in my conversations with the city traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1376.731s">He</a> said it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1377.991s">I'd</a> like to see it happen but in an inordinate amount of time has passed Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1382.213s">for</a> these signs to still remain in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1384.074s">So</a> I'd just like to ask Councilor Bears, if he doesn't mind that I offer a B paper, requesting that these signs be relocated as agreed to by the traffic engineer as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1906.601s">This</a> passage of this ordinance is something that this council and previous councils have worked on now dating back to the McGlynn administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1916.565s">The</a> voters of this community have passed their will, they passed their desire that they'd want to see medicinal recreational marijuana dispensaries legalized in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1924.349s">The</a> council did its due diligence and put together a work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1927.402s">and</a> that work product was properly vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1930.624s">It</a> addressed numerous safeguards for our community and our neighborhoods, and it was sent to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1936.166s">And</a> the administration was confined to a certain deadline as to when this process and procedure was supposed to be implemented and take place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1944.81s">We're</a> leaving millions and millions and millions of dollars on the table during a time <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1948.442s">when</a> our community is facing financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1951.466s">And</a> it's concerning to me that the administration is not acting on the will of the council and also in the best interest of the community and the will of the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1959.23s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have the community, the Cannabis Advisory Commission appear before us next week to provide us with an update as to where we are in the process, as to what exactly is going on with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1972.659s">You</a> know, I know that the Chief of Police is very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1974.681s">I</a> know that the Director of Health is very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1977.163s">I</a> know that the Building Commissioner is very busy, but I think we're all very busy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1980.825s">We're</a> all very busy because we're dedicated public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1983.867s">Now</a> the question comes upon being dedicated public servants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1987.288s">It's</a> our duty and responsibility to comply with the timelines and guidelines that are outlined in these ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1992.369s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to see where we are in this whole entire process, because I feel as though once we reach a certain point, the city will begin to see an influx of much needed funds that we can use for necessary program that all of us have talked so much about previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2004.793s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2037.629s">that</a> my assumption is that the commission's formed by legislative action, but I'm a little concerned about whether or not the commission has established these guidelines within the 90 day time period and again, accepting applications as outlined in the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2050.96s">Got</a> it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2074.125s">Who's</a> they, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2076.146s">Is</a> they the Cannabis Advisory Commission, or is they the mayor's office?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2093.917s">There's</a> this, this council Mr. President during the debate discussion and deliberation of the ordinance before us was very concerned about this mysterious conflict of interest that may or may not exist that the mayor received a conflict of interest opinion from an outside attorney that she hasn't shared with anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2111.08s">relative</a> to some sort of conflict of interest surrounding the application of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2115.864s">We</a> talked about it at length in the subcommittee meetings, we talked about it at length in the committee of the whole meetings, but we were crafting this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2122.63s">So</a> it's concerning to me, Mr. President, when we have a mysterious, never seen before conflict of interest opinion from a private attorney, which <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2131.818s">really</a> holds no water because it's not an opinion from the city solicitor who by ordinance is the only person that can give a legal opinion to the mayor or the city council in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2140.361s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2140.802s">Number</a> two, Mr. President, in fact, a conflict does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2147.317s">The</a> Transparency Administration should be telling us what this conflict is and where it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2152.744s">Number</a> two, if in fact the ordinance says that the Cannabis Advisory Commission is the entity and body that's supposed to establish this process and procedure, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2162.997s">The</a> reason it was structured like that was to keep the administration out of it, because the administration has to come back and negotiate the host community agreement after the recommendations are made from the Cannabis Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2173.105s">So</a> it seems to me, for an ordinance surrounding an issue where the mayor has this expressive, mysterious conflict of interest, she sure has a lot of interest in what goes on with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2185.195s">And</a> it's very concerning to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2186.776s">I</a> think we need to look at this a little bit harder than we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2189.959s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council call.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2401.385s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2402.645s">Again,</a> thank you for entertaining the length of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2405.466s">I</a> want it to be very specific and outline what it was I was talking about, because I don't want this to be portrayed as Councilor Knight wants to allow commercial vehicles to park on residential streets, because that's not what this is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2418.391s">What</a> this is, Mr. President, is an opportunity for us to look at a situation, a certain very specific situation, and see if we can provide relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2426.454s">Now,</a> I was contacted by a constituent who lives in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2430.585s">And</a> he lives in a very nice neighborhood, a neighborhood of homes that exceed values of $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2435.273s">And</a> he got a building permit to perform some construction on his home. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2440.942s">And</a> as part of this building permit, he also went and he got a dumpster permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2446.719s">And</a> we all know in the city of Medford, there are two types of dumpster permits that you can get in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2451.841s">You</a> can get an in driveway permit, or you can get an on street permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2455.762s">And</a> this homeowner opted to select an in driveway permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2459.703s">And</a> the reason he opted to select the in driveway permit was, as he felt as though it was more considerate for his neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2467.072s">They</a> have 800, $900,000 homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2469.754s">They</a> don't want to look out their window every day and see a dumpster sitting in the middle of the street, taking up two parking spots that could be very well utilized during the day if the dumpster wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2478.58s">So</a> what's been happening, Mr. President, is because the dumpster is taking up the parking spots in the driveway, and the gentleman is a contractor, an electrician who performs contracting services, and he runs his business out of his home, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2495.253s">home</a> and parks his commercial vehicle at his home overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2498.455s">He's</a> run into a situation where he's getting tickets for having a commercial vehicle parked on the street overnight, but the reason that the driveway is not open is because he's taken out a permit to perform work on his residential structure, which in the end is going to be beneficial to the neighborhood and to the community, because we're going to be able to capture new growth on the value of the improvements in the <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2518.79s">in</a> the property, plus the quality of life and public safety issues that are addressed by having the dumpster in the driveway as opposed to on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2527.136s">So</a> it's a very unique set of circumstances, Mr. President, that I'm hoping the Traffic Commission can take a look at and include as part of their study. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2536.443s">in</a> the recommendations that are going to be made by our other little traffic advisory group there that's been established by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2543.806s">So</a> with that being said, I'm just asking my council colleagues to ask that the traffic commission look at whether or not this is something that they feel would be possible, whether it's not something they feel would be able to be properly administered even. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2555.63s">It</a> might not be feasible at all, but I did want to make sure that I outlined a very specific subset of criteria and also neighborhood safeguards that could be in place should they wish to pursue it <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2565.734s">or</a> should they wish to find it feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2567.574s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, it's nothing more than asking the Traffic Commission a question as to whether or not they feel as though this is a policy that they'd like to adopt or something that might be good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2576.496s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2653.084s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, this is in no way, shape, or form a critique or criticism of the work that this parking commission is doing, ultimately, where the traffic commission is the ultimate policymaking authority, and the traffic commission is doing their diligence anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2670.139s">The</a> reason that I asked the traffic commission to examine it would be because this is a council action, so the council would send it to the official government body, the official commission to do the examination. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2677.966s">I</a> certainly have <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2680.455s">every</a> belief that the parking enforcement committee that's been established is going to take the proper necessary steps to examine certain aspects of parking in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2689.722s">And</a> this is no way, shape or form of a way to be critical of what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2694.325s">However,</a> it's a very specific ask that, you know, that I'm placing on the traffic commission based upon a very stringent set of circumstances and rare criteria that doesn't normally happen here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2853.38s">Mr.</a> President, the only issue I have with that is that where the council is not the policymaking authority to establish parking policy in the community, the vetting that we're going to conduct would have no implement on the outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2863.927s">The</a> traffic commissions the policymaking authority, the council so we could do all the vetting in the world and we can make all the recommendations in the world but <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2870.404s">What's</a> gonna come out is what comes out of their policymaking authority that's enacted by statute, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2874.465s">So,</a> you know, we can look at it and say, you know, is there a possibility to enable, to establish a temporary parking permit for commercial vehicles who are conducting home maintenance in an owner-occupied home and let them come up with the safeguards that they want, or we can make recommendations of safeguards, but we're not the policymaking authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2892.851s">You</a> know, how much time, energy, and effort do we wanna put into vetting something that's not under our scope and purview when we have so much more on our plate to already chew?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2964.633s">Mr.</a> President, in the spirit of compromise and to not waste time on an issue that's really asking for an advisory opinion, what I'll do is <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2971.866s">withdraw</a> the paper and write the traffic commission's chairman under separate cover as an individual, not as a member of the body, asking that they take a look at this and they can take it up or they can not take it up as an individual, as opposed to as a member of the public body. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2986.511s">And</a> maybe that's something that can get them to take a look at it and still address some of the concerns that the councilors have. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2991.632s">But</a> at this time, Mr. President, I'd withdraw the paper, whereas it's not ready for prime time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=2997.214s">We</a> can take another look at it at a later date once we get some more information on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3194.11s">Mr.</a> McGregor, how are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3195.491s">Through</a> you, Mr. President, to Mr. McGregor, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3198.594s">I</a> do have 100% support of voting for this paper that's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3206.461s">I</a> wanna preface that before I ask you a series of questions, because I don't want you to get nervous or worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3211.786s">But</a> one of the things that the council's been doing is taking a look at what we require when people come before us, in terms of what materials and documentation we're requiring, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3221.438s">We're</a> looking at special permits and what's required of special permit applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3226.323s">Now,</a> sometimes we get some reports that when you apply for a common victuals license, it's quite an inordinately long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3234.53s">Can</a> you just tell me a little bit about your application process? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3237.653s">When</a> you first submitted your application, how long it took you to get your approvals after you had your packets submitted and all that stuff?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3291.769s">Okay,</a> and so from start to finish, what are you talking, three months, four months?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3313.525s">And</a> do you have your final inspection scheduled with the Board of Health? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3316.146s">Has</a> that already occurred?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3319.947s">And</a> everything was all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3321.907s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3324.288s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3324.968s">I</a> appreciate both your time and answering the questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3671.39s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3672.691s">So</a> what I'm hearing is this sounds more like a commissary location where the food's prepared, packaged, and then you use that as a delivery hub where you get everything ready and packed up at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3684.54s">And</a> then you go and take it out and deliver it to the community just like you'd be a delivery driver based on basically fulfilling the orders that you had received previously that morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3693.887s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3694.788s">Yes,</a> sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3695.528s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3696.989s">And</a> how many trucks do you operate out of this location?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3701.614s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3702.515s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3703.195s">And</a> do you have any employees?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3707.358s">Five</a> at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3708.439s">And</a> I'm just because I'm going over your application and I'm looking at, you know, and I think it's a great concept and it's something that I'll support. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3715.463s">It</a> says that you don't carry any workers' compensation insurance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3741.989s">Okay,</a> so you understand your obligations then? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3744.47s">once</a> you have employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3745.371s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3746.653s">And</a> lastly, similar to the question that I asked the previous individuals that were before us, from start to finish, how long did it take for you to get the permitting application and all that stuff put together? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3757.404s">And</a> once you submitted your permit, how long did it take for you to get to this point where you're at tonight?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3830.1s">I</a> don't think you have anything to be nervous about. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3833.242s">Well,</a> I'm glad that the process worked out well for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3836.084s">Thank</a> you very much for sharing your experience and you have my support this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3985.66s">One</a> at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3986.2s">Practice</a> has always been one at a time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=3999.427s">Danielle</a> is, there she is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4205.531s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor Marksley is 100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4208.112s">If</a> you look at the City of Medford's ordinances, you'll see Section 6 <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4215.032s">The</a> book commission is still exercise all the duties assigned under Massachusetts general laws, chapter 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4220.755s">And</a> it also says that the public city losing council or maybe used or known. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4240.304s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I'm not so comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4244.623s">given</a> up and making an appropriation of any funds without at first going through the proper channels outlined by city ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4498.178s">I</a> think we're also going down a slippery slope and we're relying on the legal opinion of the CPC representative from the Pax Commission to make a determination, the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4508.683s">And,</a> you know, we have a outside council that the city has been relying upon so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4514.145s">We</a> apparently have ample legal minds to address a concern or a question like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4519.368s">So</a> maybe we should get that answer before we move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4709.979s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4712.367s">Point</a> of information, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4714.965s">The</a> response we received back from the administration wasn't necessarily reflective of the policy that was adopted by the school committee in the prior years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4724.23s">I</a> know the opinion is what it is and what came from the school department is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4727.671s">But</a> I think that if we go back and take a longer how to look at what was actually said at those meetings when they were talking about donations, that a policy was enacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4736.796s">So</a> look, you know, the question was, we want to take a look at that policy and see what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4740.918s">But</a> I for one, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4742.807s">don't</a> feel comfortable appropriating any money unless we're sure we're doing it legally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4746.189s">I</a> mean, that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4747.23s">Why</a> don't we get the confirmations that we need to properly vet the issue and make a vote that's rooted in the basis of, you know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4951.366s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4953.533s">I</a> do believe that the council does have the prerogative to either appropriate the requested sum or reduce the requested sum. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4961.277s">And</a> maybe we could reduce the requested sum by the amount that the excavation will cost and allow the applicant to come back to us at a later date once we get our questions answered, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4971.804s">Number</a> two, I keep hearing that the wall's called Pop's Wall, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4975.666s">That's</a> the name of the wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4977.622s">So</a> why do we keep calling it the Slave Wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4979.463s">Why</a> don't we call it what the wall's named? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4981.444s">Why</a> do we keep referring to it as Slave Wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4983.345s">Slave</a> Wall, Slave Wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4984.385s">If</a> it's Pop's Wall, why aren't we calling it Pop's Wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4986.927s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4987.927s">Why</a> is that the message that we wanna deliver in Drill Home, that it's Slave Wall when it's Pop's Wall? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4991.929s">It's</a> called Pop's Wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4993.15s">And</a> it has a history behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=4994.39s">And</a> I think that, you know, the history that's behind it, that, you know, might be a little bit more interesting to people if they say Pop's Wall, why is it called that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5002.775s">Let's</a> learn about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5004.235s">As</a> opposed to the thing being called Slave Wall, especially, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5007.778s">based</a> upon the tenor of what's going on in America and Massachusetts and in the area these days, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5014.002s">So</a> I'd just like to put that out there as a non sequitur. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5017.083s">But</a> with that being said, I wouldn't be opposed to appropriating the funds that are necessary to repair the wall and withhold the funds that are necessary to perform the excavation, if that's a direction that we wanna go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5029.691s">So</a> I'd offer that out there for my councils to discuss and debate so that we can move on to some of the next items on the list.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5384.584s">I'd</a> prefer, Mr. President, that if we're gonna proceed, we earn the side of caution and make sure that we take a vote that's confident and rooted in the legal basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5392.726s">And</a> if in fact we're moving, I mean, can we even do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5395.907s">Can</a> we even take a vote that says that it's contingent upon something else happening somewhere else once we appropriate the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5400.308s">Are</a> we ever gonna get it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5401.208s">Are</a> they gonna, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5402.608s">And</a> I'm not too confident that the administration is gonna adhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5406.456s">to</a> the contingencies that we're putting in place based upon some of the conversations that we've already had earlier in the night.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5429.798s">And</a> I mean, my recommendation would be to table the matter until approval from the Park Commission is garnered or the city solicitor provides us with an opinion saying that this project isn't subject to their approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5451.814s">Or</a> the city solicitor determines that this type of project isn't subject to their purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5455.917s">Or</a> the city solicitor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5509.72s">Certainly</a> not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5511.161s">And,</a> you know, the reason there is the issue is because, you know, we're the fiduciary, you know, we're the ones that are responsible for the... And, you know, I just really think it's important that, you know, at all... <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5525.549s">of</a> all the jobs and responsibilities that we have as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5528.651s">This</a> is the most significant, you know, spending a taxpayer's dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5532.114s">It's</a> the spending of taxpayer dollars that's above and beyond the assessment of the property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5536.077s">So</a> I really think it's important that we do it the right way and that we get the question answered once and for all so we don't run into these circumstances again in the future.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5578.38s">motion</a> to table this is for a date certain after the park board meeting after the park board meetings commission meeting right yeah that would be my recommendation if my Councilors agree you know getting the opinion from the solicitor i think is important so that um next year or next round when this question comes up again we don't have the same discussion we have the document right before us thank you
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5835.768s">Seems</a> like my connection is unstable.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5840.61s">Yeah,</a> so he said it looks like I was shaken out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5844.191s">I</a> do have some concern, Mr. President, and it's not going to stand in my way of supporting this paper this evening because, quite frankly, we don't have an entity that provides this type of service, servicing the residents of our community right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5857.294s">But</a> when you review the appropriations that we're making to Action for Boston Community Development and the homelessness prevention initiatives that we're supporting, we're seeing that the eligibility <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5869.717s">requirements</a> and the people that are calling for services, about 70% of those people are being turned away because they're not eligible for services because they don't reside in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5879.663s">And</a> I think a lot of that has to do with the fact, Mr. President, that ABCD is Action for Boston Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5886.187s">And</a> while they are filling a void in this community, I think more people in this community would be inclined to call the Medford Housing Authority for assistance or the Medford Housing Authority for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5897.644s">with</a> Director Driscoll over there about potentially expanding their programming and their services to deliver this type of service that we're seeing here through ABCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5909.03s">So</a> that's something I'm very excited about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5911.732s">Also,</a> in looking at the type of service that we're seeing ABCD perform in this community, we are seeing a duplication of efforts because we do have our, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5922.117s">The</a> office, the Metro Consumer Advisory Commission, located in City Hall on the first floor, is also handling certain aspects of eviction and raft application implementation with the raft program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5934.135s">So</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, as we move forward and begin to further disperse funds related to affordable housing and housing in general, that we take a look at possibly expanding our relationship with the Medford Housing Authority to develop a much more city-specific program that really works for us, where 70% of the people that are calling aren't being turned away because the resources are not meeting the eligibility requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5959.515s">You</a> know, when you think about a housing need or someone that's looking for help regarding housing, the first place they call is the housing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5966.42s">So</a> I think that that might be a great spot for us to really start focusing our efforts and expanding this type of programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=5971.603s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to add my two cents and put forward a B paper requesting that the housing authority and the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission report back to the council what steps and efforts they've taken in expanding their rental assistance and eviction assistance programming that they have here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6016.569s">The</a> housing security concerns in the programming that we're funding through the Community Preservation Act and whether or not they'd be willing to expand their role based on the conversations I've had with Director Driscoll. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6027.076s">I</a> have said that, but we'd like to get it back in formal fashion, if that's not too much to ask.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6219.865s">Um,</a> public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6223.127s">Mr.</a> President, if I could make a, take a moment to make a brief announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6227.23s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6228.991s">And</a> I think that this is really, I don't know if Councilor Marks got a chance to see this, but I know this is going to make his day. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6234.754s">Just</a> a couple of weeks ago, we put on a resolution for Brian Branson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6238.416s">Councilor</a> Marks was the lead sponsor of that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6241.058s">And</a> I was going through my packet this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6244.179s">And</a> you know, as part of that resolution, we amended the paper and requested that we send it to Mr. Maloney in the athletic department to discuss doing something and Brian's on it to reflect and recognize all the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6254.585s">on</a> behalf of the youth in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6256.426s">And</a> in our paper in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6258.847s">This</a> week, Mr. President, we have a paper before us, relative to Council Resolution 20682 offered by Councilor Marks, and I think it's really great so I just wanted to share this with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6271.29s">Councilor</a> Marks's resolution to recognize Brian Branson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6273.833s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6275.035s">Hank</a> Morse and I have had a great opportunity of being Brian's teammates on both the Medford Babe Ruth Red Sox in Medford High School 1984 baseball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6282.984s">I</a> will be creating the annual Brian Branson Memorial Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6286.969s">which</a> will be given out at the annual Medford High School M Club Club Banquet. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6290.812s">Councilor</a> Marks' comments will be included in the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6293.513s">Decades</a> of unselfish volunteerism and commitment to Medford High School student athletes programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6298.097s">Thank</a> you, stay safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6299.297s">Sincerely,</a> Robert Maloney, Director of Athletics, Medford School Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=6303.08s">Mr.</a> President, I just wanted to take an opportunity to read that in the record and congratulate Councilor Marks on a job well done and on, you know, great effort in recognizing someone in the community who's done such great things and is going through a tough time.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_r-A28SRNwTU/2024-11-19_r-A28SRNwTU.html">City Council 01-26-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=345.69s">Mr.</a> President? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=346.71s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=348.932s">Would</a> the gentleman be so kind, Mr. President, to explain to us how much of that $300,000 is for the architectural dig services?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=394.202s">Mr.</a> President, the other question I do have is, is there any documentation that the council can review concerning the parcel that was on that property? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=402.929s">It's</a> my understanding that there was a home that might've been located there and that there was a consultant that was hired that did some type of review or study and reported that there <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=414.853s">of</a> the opinion there may be artifacts there, and I'm wondering if the council can get a report, take a look at the report at some point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=439.038s">And</a> Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, when they talk about artifacts, what type of artifacts would come out of a location like this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=446.423s">I</a> believe it was the Brooks setup, that was like vacation homes for the Brooks family, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=452.227s">What</a> type of artifacts would you expect to find or consider finding if you did such type work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=484.741s">Correct,</a> which would lead me to my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=486.683s">If</a> they did find something, would there be a request for further or future appropriation relative to further or future excavation of the site? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=493.432s">If</a> something was found, would this $50,000 cover everything?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=516.437s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. Carr.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1316.659s">I</a> do believe that if this parcel of land is dedicated park land, then it would fall into the control and jurisdiction of the Parks Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1325.647s">because</a> it's a park, and that's what the Park Commission is there for, to govern parks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1670.95s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1672.832s">Before</a> the approval of the construction plans for the ambulatory surgical care center, this council engaged with our friends from Circle Health to conduct a series of monthly meetings to keep the neighborhood and the community informed as to the progress and status of that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1691.093s">After</a> the passage of the paperwork that was before this council, construction started, and we had made a commitment to the neighborhood and to this community that we would periodically have Circle Health back in before us to provide us with further and future updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1705.263s">And</a> this paper before us this evening is just that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1708.165s">I'd</a> ask that we turn the floor over to the co-sponsors, and then after that, the representative from Hallmark Health, Mr. Trubilski. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1716.291s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=1716.651s">Council</a> Marks, co-sponsor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3031.834s">First</a> of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Fuller and Sam and the rest of the team for coming out this evening to provide us with an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3038.479s">Secondly,</a> I'm hoping that they can provide us with a little bit of information of how they've done in securing some <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3050.647s">I</a> don't want to call them clients, but doctors to fill these rooms that they're going to be creating there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3057.428s">I</a> know that was one of the concerns that we had was what type of treatment modalities were going to be coming out of there through the ambulatory care center in the medical village. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3064.91s">So</a> maybe Mr. Fuller can tell us some of the highlights of how far they've come along in getting some doctors, recruiting doctors and other practices to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3073.672s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3134.936s">And</a> if you could just speak a little bit to the status of the urgent care office, the current and ongoing status at the future of the urgent care office may be.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3176.752s">And</a> the last question, Mr. Fuller, I know recently the state legislature passed a law requiring the proper demarking of a emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3187.477s">And</a> I know that we had some concerns over the signage on the highway, directing people to a hospital, and some of the signage at the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3193.963s">I</a> know that the city was able to, through the work of the council, write to Mass Highway and have them take down some of the highway signs that guided people to the LMH site as an existing hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3204.173s">Is</a> there any issues or concerns with the hospital being in compliance with this law at this point in time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3227.252s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3227.592s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3695.606s">As</a> such, I withdraw the motion before the council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3725.062s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, this paper 2 shall be withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3728.084s">I</a> have to speak to this because this is an item that you have marked up for a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3731.807s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3732.528s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3852.724s">I'm</a> moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=3853.824s">To</a> move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4513.486s">Vice</a> President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4515.066s">Mr.</a> President, I'm just wondering where this item is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4520.007s">Well,</a> let me start with, if we look back several years ago, the school department, I do believe, through their school committee, established a policy on accepting donations and also a policy on the use of school facilities and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4535.35s">And</a> before this matter comes before the council, my question to the administration would be, has the school committee approved the proposed use? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4543.943s">I</a> cannot answer that, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4548.312s">The</a> second concern I have, Mr. President, when you're looking at the application, if you see the application that's before us, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4555.527s">Food</a> Truck Festivals of America, 50C3 status, no, a for-profit organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4561.091s">Then</a> if you turn to page two of the application, Mr. President, you'll see we add 16% to each meal's costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4566.934s">Families</a> pre-order a meal and welcome the opportunity to also support the school's PTO as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4571.437s">So</a> it seems to me like this is just a surcharge on a meal that then gets passed along to the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4576.54s">Those</a> are some concerns that I have based on my first and initial view at this application, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4627.95s">I'm</a> satisfied with your looking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4629.991s">I</a> mean, it's a function of government that has to go through the process, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4632.713s">So</a> if the school committee hasn't voted on it, then why don't we just table it, and when they do, we'll come back and revisit the situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4639.989s">That</a> would be my recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4643.392s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4643.553s">Hsu,</a> do you want to speak on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4645.114s">I</a> have no problem hearing what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4646.235s">Hsu</a> has to say, but in terms of, it has to go through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4650.179s">And</a> I'd feel more comfortable if that process was approved before we approve this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4654.543s">Or</a> took even consideration on deliberation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4708.155s">Point</a> of clarification, we approved it once. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4710.096s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4710.276s">They</a> held zero events. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4711.336s">They</a> came back for another permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4715.537s">We</a> denied that permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4716.537s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4717.859s">Because</a> there was no dates or times. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4719.821s">Well,</a> because we didn't want to also harm our brick and mortar restaurants in the community during the middle of the COVID pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4726.686s">And</a> then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4728.347s">Anger,</a> I think her name is, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4729.909s">Angry,</a> she left and we voted it down and then their application was withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4736.194s">And</a> now this is the... <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4738.52s">That</a> wasn't a fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4740.061s">That</a> was to go into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4741.601s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=4741.881s">So</a> this was never before the council before to be on school premises or, um, or to be, um, some sort of donation, um, have some sort of donation mechanism, both of which need to be approved by the school committee if it's going to be on their grounds and if those funds are going to go to the PTO.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5095.877s">Um,</a> yeah, I can understand what Councilor Marks coming from and, you know, in the interest of supporting our PTO locally, um, I will go along with that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5106.758s">However,</a> to see a for-profit organization gouge the community for 16%, in my opinion, this is in no way, shape, or form an effort to give to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5116.862s">This</a> is an effort for them to open the door to get into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5120.383s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5120.963s">This</a> isn't like a brick and mortar store that wants to give back to the population that's made them successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5125.865s">This</a> is an entity that wants to come into Medford and wants to bring food trucks up and down our streets and compete with our brick and mortar stores who have always been there for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5133.517s">So</a> that's my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5134.538s">I</a> don't see this as necessarily a business that's coming to Medford that wants to do well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5141.524s">I</a> think that this is a business that's coming to Medford that just got a permit denied, and now because they got a permit denied, now they're saying, well, what can we do to butter up the city council to get further access to more permits? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5151.532s">But</a> I will go along this evening with what Councilor Marks has proposed, and I will second his motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r-A28SRNwTU&t=5194.109s">And</a> I do also want to point out that we can't control when, how, and if the school committee even takes this matter up.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk/2024-11-19_lQjJdcfTNfk.html">City Council 01-19-21</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=265.482s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=266.463s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=268.023s">I'd</a> like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=271.704s">I</a> believe it was two and a half years ago that this council voted to reduce <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=279.342s">the</a> interest rate on payments that were in arrears from, I think it was from 18 down to 14 or 15 as Councilor Marks noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=286.972s">And</a> that was in an effort to assist with individuals that needed some relief, the individuals that weren't able to meet their obligations here underneath these certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=297.127s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing the paper up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=300.549s">Ultimately,</a> there's a lot of discussion about housing in the community, and a lot's being asked of the residential property owner here in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=309.053s">You</a> know, the community only has so many ways that it can raise money, and residential property taxes shares the brunt of the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=317.177s">So</a> anything that we can do to help our residential property owners, I think, would make sense, Mr. President, and I support the matter wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=322.64s">Look</a> forward to hearing from our state delegation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=849.276s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=853.622s">Building</a> on what Councilor Scarpelli said, those are two pair of very big shoes to fill if young officers want to fill these shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=862.146s">Officer</a> Kelly and Officer Butts have been long time fixtures in our police department for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=868.409s">Individuals</a> that earn the respect of the community because of their efforts and actions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=873.772s">Not</a> because they wore a badge and a uniform, but because of what they did while wearing that badge and uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=879.095s">I've</a> met Officer Kelly a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=882.289s">Had</a> the opportunity to develop a decent friendship with Officer Butts over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=886.412s">And</a> he's someone that really has quite a great outlook on the way things work, great outlook on life. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=894.078s">And</a> I know that his compatriot, Officer Kelly, shares that same outlook, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=899.082s">To</a> have the opportunity to have a professional career in law enforcement and be able to work for over three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=907.088s">And</a> at the end of that career, have the opportunity to stand in front of your colleagues and retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=912.11s">And</a> safely go home to your family for that last call is something that really deserves to be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=918.331s">These</a> two officers have put <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=926.795s">their</a> life on the line for the residents in this community, and that should be recognized. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=931.819s">I</a> thank Councilor Marks for bringing this matter forward, and I wish them both the best of luck in their golden years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=937.283s">It's</a> been well deserved, and I hope that they are able to pursue all their dreams and wishes in retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=944.148s">Because</a> it's all too often that we hear the statistics of individuals in police and <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=949.592s">that</a> when they retire, they usually don't retire in good health. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=952.914s">And</a> I understand that both Mr. Kelly and Mr. Butts have a lot of good life left in them and they're going to be able to collect that pension money for a long time and enjoy it and spend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=963.12s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I echo my council colleague's sentiments and congratulate them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=969.184s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=969.864s">Councilor</a> Falco.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1731.448s">Isn't</a> everyone going to be vaccinated by then?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1779.087s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1780.088s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1782.529s">I</a> was saying, I think that this was something that we asked Councilor Falco to do last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1787.673s">But</a> then with the pandemic and everybody wanting to work from home continuously still to this day, makes it a little bit difficult sometimes to get everybody in the same room, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1801.063s">But</a> I really think it's important that we look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1803.925s">And</a> for the last several years, this has been a discussion and a topic at this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1808.268s">The</a> format and presentation of the budget, what's required by the administration per law versus what's requested of the administration by the council so that we can make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1819.437s">And</a> I think one of the most important things that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1822.799s">is</a> to make data-driven decisions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1826.521s">And</a> that goes right into what Councilor March was saying about utilizing the 311 of the see, click, fix information that we have at hand to see where our needs are and doing this needs assessment and looking at service delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1838.086s">We</a> could talk all day about why the diversity director shouldn't be merged with the HR director and eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1845.369s">But</a> at the end of the day, the services that the people in this community want to see is their streets paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1849.686s">They</a> want to be able to pick up the phone and call the DPW and get a tree taken down and not have a stump there for the next 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1855.05s">And</a> then when the stump comes down, they want to make sure the sidewalk gets fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1857.411s">They</a> don't have to wait another five years for that, so it's not a 25 year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1860.593s">That's</a> what the people want to see in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1862.635s">They</a> want to see services delivered and they want to see a return on their investment of their tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1867.838s">So</a> I think it's very important that we start talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1871.06s">And</a> I personally feel as though the most vital department that we need to start this conversation with is with our public works department. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1879.745s">Everybody</a> wants to pick up the phone and be able to call the DPW and get a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1883.006s">And</a> right now, you can't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1884.206s">You</a> get put on a list and it takes a year or two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1887.507s">For</a> 11, 12 months now, we've heard about a pavement management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1890.367s">I'm</a> still dying to see what that looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1892.048s">I'm</a> very excited to see what this pavement management plan looks like because we have about $7.5 million in 2016 money worth of emergency arteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1902.93s">that</a> could be replaced tomorrow, because the condition of our roadways is subpar, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1908.176s">So</a> there's a lot of work that needs to be done, but it all comes down to the mighty buck, the mighty dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1912.581s">And</a> unless we're all sitting in the same room, working together towards a common goal, we're never going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1918.846s">We're</a> never going to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1919.907s">So</a> with that being said, I think Councilor Marks bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1922.309s">I</a> support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1922.97s">I</a> mean, I constantly Falco for bringing the matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1925.312s">I</a> support this resolution wholeheartedly and I look forward to working with you, Mr. President, to put a schedule together for us to conduct these pre-budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1933.459s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1934.14s">Councilor</a> Morell.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1989.613s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1990.113s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, I disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1991.934s">I</a> really disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1992.595s">It</a> should be mandatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1993.595s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1994.416s">I</a> disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1994.936s">It</a> should be mandatory that they come and appear before this body if they're going to be talking about how we're spending taxpayer dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=1999.879s">As</a> long as we can do it safely and within the guidelines that have been put out by the CDC and the Board of Health, we should have our department heads in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2005.403s">It's</a> going to be seven city councils, the city clerk, and one other individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2008.825s">We</a> could find a room big enough to fit all those people in here if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2011.527s">We</a> have the personal protective equipment available. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2013.888s">We</a> put up these <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2017.03s">Sneeze</a> gods, I guess you want to call them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2019.311s">But</a> I disagree, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2020.632s">I</a> think that we can do this, and we can do it safely, and we can do it in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2024.234s">The</a> department heads are coming to work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2026.895s">This</a> is part of their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2027.776s">This</a> is part of their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2029.877s">And</a> they should be willing to meet with us as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2032.479s">So</a> with that being said, it's neither here nor there. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2036.202s">I</a> want to get the meeting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2037.343s">It's</a> not going to be something that's going to affect my vote this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2039.946s">But</a> I disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2041.367s">I</a> think that we've got to roll our sleeves up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2043.569s">When</a> we're talking about something as serious as the finances in this community, how we're spending taxpayer dollars, we should all be in the same room doing it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2380.048s">Councilor</a> Knight has it in front of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2381.89s">I</a> think, I'm looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2383.131s">See,</a> click, fix.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2387.535s">I</a> believe it came in at 10 past 1 today, January 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2390.258s">And</a> what it says is, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2394.951s">Dear</a> President Caraviello and Councilors, I wanted to reach out and give you an update on C-Click Fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2399.913s">Over</a> the last several months, Lisa and Daria have been getting trained on the system we had in place and have been working to update our system by meeting with department heads and City Hall staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2410.038s">They</a> have customized it to fit Medford and our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2413.86s">Trainings</a> have started and we will continue throughout the next 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2418.481s">I</a> actually received a training today and then a pothole email request came in and I was able to log it through C-Click Fix quite easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2426.883s">We</a> plan to publicly launch the newly updated system in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2431.024s">Our</a> hope is that all city-related requests can be logged in through C-Click Fix and we ask that you use it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2437.445s">Daria</a> and Lisa can meet with you anytime to train you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2440.426s">I</a> have CC'd them both so you can easily set up an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2443.647s">Brianna.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2486.521s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2489.966s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2492.449s">C-Click</a> fix has been a, I guess we'll call it a bee in my bonnet for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2498.155s">Ever</a> since it's been rolled out, I've requested a lot of data because I'd like to make those data driven decisions when it comes down to what our needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2506.995s">And</a> for some reason, the information that gets put into see click fix always seem to be, you know, the fruit from the poisonous tree that no one was ever allowed to touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2515.922s">And</a> if we ever saw it, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2517.363s">We'd</a> have to sign on old, the secrecy or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2519.965s">So</a> I thank councilor Falco for bringing this up and I welcome the opportunity to sit down and see where we are with the open requests, the requests that remain outstanding and the requests that have also been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2532.214s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2533.095s">I</a> know, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2533.96s">Some</a> of the concerns that have been raised over time, like Councilor Marks would always say, that's not a city road, so it's not our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2542.225s">Call</a> your state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2543.365s">Well,</a> that's not giving a taxpayer a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2546.988s">So,</a> you know, I think Councilor Falco hit the nail on the head when we talked about the see, click, fix system and ways that we can improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2553.451s">It's</a> something that we all want to see be successful here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2555.773s">And</a> I think we all have opinions on how it could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2558.154s">So</a> I welcome the opportunity to meet with the administration and talk with them a little bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2561.977s">our</a> vision for how this all works. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2563.84s">It</a> wasn't too long ago that Mayor Lungo sat right here and she expressed some of the same concerns that we're expressing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2570.731s">So</a> I look forward to this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2572.534s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=2573.275s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3152.764s">I</a> do believe that the chair <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3157.308s">The</a> co-chairs expressed that the purview of their analysis did not extend to paid for park. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3165.453s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3165.953s">So</a> it was not extending to the business districts or to the parking meter situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3170.035s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3170.255s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3254.229s">Point</a> of information, they can be ready to come, but I think the parking related questions that they're going to be ready to answer is why aren't you focusing on this when this sounds like a bigger need in the community than what you're looking at? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3266.036s">That's</a> my concern, but I just don't want to lose focus of the meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3531.583s">Who</a> are we sending this condemnation to?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3543.635s">I'm</a> pretty sure they didn't like what was going on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3678.57s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3679.251s">Mr.</a> President, on December 15th, this council passed paper 20677, which is virtually identical to the paper, the council of bears is put on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3686.972s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3687.579s">The</a> chief of staff says he needs a paper to cross his desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3689.78s">He's</a> got to look back in his calendar about three weeks, because he's already got it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3887.767s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3890.728s">In</a> usual form, any legal settlement over $2,500 would have to come before the City Council if that settlement was voluntary and not a judgment by a judge. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3900.19s">And</a> when we got a copy of the Warren articles that we fought for for so long, I had the opportunity to review them. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3908.537s">And</a> when I got to the legal expenses line items under accounts numbers 5761 and 5762, I saw a number of expenditures that exceeded $2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3920.646s">Which</a> led me to believe that there were legal settlements that were made that the appropriations were not passed through the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3929.113s">So</a> I'm asking for a detailed line item breakdown of those two accounts to do a review and conduct due diligence to make sure that we're in compliance with municipal finance law and to make sure that the matters that are supposed to appear before the council due to those, what's that word that everybody likes to use? <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3943.184s">John,</a> what's that word?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3945.146s">Transparency,</a> that's the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3947.247s">So</a> that we can be as transparent as possible, but also so that we can be in compliance with municipal finance law. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3951.731s">So</a> in the past, we've seen people that have come and have tripped on a sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3956.955s">broken</a> an arm, come before the council and the council has had to approve their settlement. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3961.579s">Um,</a> we've had vehicles damaged by a fire engine. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3964.562s">Those</a> individuals been damaged in car accidents by a fire engine and a DPW truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3968.545s">Those</a> settlements have had to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3970.467s">Um,</a> so I'd just like to see an accounting of a five, seven, six, one and five, seven, six, two, um, because it stuck out. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3977.99s">it</a> didn't look right to me and I want to make sure that we're doing things the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3982.011s">Um,</a> as the fiduciary in this community, the city council has a strong responsibility financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3988.153s">Um,</a> and if we're expending money without the appropriate approvals, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=3992.774s">Um,</a> so I'd ask that the, uh, finance director provide us with this breakdown, um, in conjunction with the city solicitor, um, to be sure that we protect everybody's rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4000.736s">If</a> it's something that needs to be addressed in an executive session, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4003.977s">I</a> would happily welcome that opinion from the city councilor, I mean the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4008.518s">But</a> I really think it's something we need to take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4012.14s">There's</a> a lot of talk about legal settlements that are occurring in this community, but some of those have to come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4018.041s">And</a> I'd like to make sure that we are being provided with the opportunity to do the work that we've been elected to do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4066.952s">I</a> have no problem amending the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4068.233s">I</a> just think it's important to point out that there's a difference between a settlement and a judgment. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4072.214s">If</a> there was a judgment by a judge, then it automatically gets paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4076.355s">But</a> if there was a settlement that was entered into voluntarily by the parties, then that voluntary expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4080.956s">has</a> to come through the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4082.017s">The</a> council has to approve that money because it wasn't ordered by a judge, where if it's ordered by a judge, we can't say no to it anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4090.962s">So</a> I think that that's the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4131.052s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4133.054s">Gene</a> McGillicuddy, as many of us behind this rail know, was a fixture in the city of Medford for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4139.259s">Any</a> given summer afternoon from probably 1985 to 1995, you could have found him down at Santoro Field coaching Foodmaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4149.408s">I'll</a> tell you, he wasn't a great pitching coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4151.87s">Mr.</a> President, because I moved to lacrosse after Little League, after playing for Coach McGillicuddy on Foodmaster for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4158.674s">Maybe</a> too many. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4159.355s">I</a> probably should have got moved up to the minors, out of the minors by the time I turned 15, but that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4164.658s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. McGillicuddy and I go way back. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4167.38s">He</a> was a dear friend of mine personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4169.461s">I</a> had the opportunity to play for him as a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4172.243s">My</a> mother actually worked with Mr. McGillicuddy in the same office for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4176.445s">And</a> then I had the opportunity of being a neighbor of his very recently, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4180.628s">I</a> had the opportunity to go to school with Kathleen, grew up with his daughter, Kathleen. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4184.17s">I've</a> become very friendly with his son-in-law, John, over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4187.032s">And</a> let me tell you, Gene McGillicuddy was just a great guy, someone that was always willing to help out, someone that was always willing to volunteer, someone that wore his heart on his sleeve. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4196.558s">He</a> was a quiet man that carried a big stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4200.44s">When</a> he spoke, he made sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4202.342s">He</a> didn't talk often, but when he did speak, it was because he had something to say and it was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4206.564s">And</a> he was someone that I admired, someone that I enjoyed growing up around, learning some of the lessons of life through Mr. McGillicuddy's dry sense of humor and interesting way of approaching things was always something I enjoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4218.615s">So</a> I had the opportunity of, like I said, living next door to Mr. McGillicuddy for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4222.878s">And</a> he and Maureen were just great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4224.98s">And</a> he's going to be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4226.421s">He</a> was certainly someone that contributed to the fabric of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4229.482s">He's</a> put in years and years and years in the city of Medford, grew up living on Hugh Mav, right behind the Dame School. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4235.303s">Mr.</a> McGillicuddy was a fixture in that neighborhood, taking care of his neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4238.524s">His</a> house was always open to the kids in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4241.945s">And</a> when he moved and downsized to the condos over at 190 High Street, he was someone that was always willing to give his time as a member of the board of trustees. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4249.708s">So</a> Gene's volunteerism is second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4253.969s">that</a> probably donated 50 years of his life to the city of Medford, to his neighbors, and to his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4258.852s">He's</a> someone that should be admired, someone that should be recognized, but first of all, most importantly, someone that should be remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4263.934s">So</a> I ask that my council colleagues join me in extending a deep and sincere condolences to the McGillicuddy family in their time of need.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4898.647s">I</a> had the pleasure of working with Karen for a number of years while she was here as our health director. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4903.27s">And</a> to echo Councilor Marksley's sentiments, <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4907.878s">She</a> was firm, but very fair and very compassionate. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4911.561s">And</a> when Karen was here as a Director of Health and Elder Services, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, she was also a very devoted daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4921.388s">Karen</a> played the role of caregiver to her father when her father was very ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4927.472s">And</a> that never got in the way of the work or the job that she did here. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4931.835s">And</a> I can't think of a better person to be selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4935.165s">for</a> Mystic Valley Elder Services to serve as the vice president at the Karen Rose. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4939.528s">A</a> true professional, a great department head, someone that I sorely miss seeing around the building and seeing around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4945.973s">I</a> haven't seen her as much as I used to because of everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4950.016s">But</a> I'll tell you this, I feel better knowing that Karen Rose is on the board of directors and that she's a vice president over there where I have two aging parents that are in this community and I know <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4961.605s">that</a> there's somebody over there that's making decisions that's going to be sure that they put people first, not the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4967.53s">And</a> Karen Rose is that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4968.971s">So</a> thank you very much to my council colleagues for putting this on and congratulations to Karen because she's a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/lQjJdcfTNfk&t=4974.136s">And</a> this is truly nothing more than a reflections of all the hard work, dedication, dedication and action that she's put in over the past 30 years as a nurse.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_u0KcLn7Rc-s/2024-11-19_u0KcLn7Rc-s.html">City Council 01-12-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4157.808s">Mr.</a> President, I'm hoping that I'm, I'd like to actually, I'm not hoping to like to make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4161.391s">I</a> am making a motion now that we have a committee of the whole on this, um, on both positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4165.254s">Um,</a> I do have a couple of questions and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4167.335s">Uh,</a> I do believe back in January or February of last year, uh, this council asked for a legal opinion from the city solicitor, um, relative to whether or not it would pose a conflict of interest that a diversity director was also acting as a human resources coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4182.466s">Um,</a> so I'd like to just take the opportunity to go through those, those, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4185.828s">responses</a> and files, Mr. President, before we take affirmative action on this paper that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4190.949s">So</a> I'd ask that the paper be scheduled for a committee of the whole.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=4327.027s">I</a> do believe it's a reappointment, correct, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5390.584s">Also</a> Tuesday evening, Mr. President, I do believe is the traffic commission meeting relative to Southern Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5395.389s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5396.668s">relative</a> to South and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5397.868s">So</a> again, check the city website for more information on how to log on via Zoom for the traffic committee commission meeting relative to South Street and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/u0KcLn7Rc-s&t=5406.632s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_y31vTPCB2oY/2024-11-19_y31vTPCB2oY.html">City Council 01-05-21</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1345.944s">Mr.</a> President, well, many of us were glad to see 2020 pass us by in the rear view mirror. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1351.646s">There</a> are still many of us, I'm not talking about my wife, I swear to God, that wants to keep the Christmas tree up a little longer than January 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1359.008s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can petition the administration to extend Christmas tree pickup for one additional week so that the week of the 11th and the week of the 18th, Christmas tree pickup can be conducted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1421.085s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1422.566s">For</a> those of you who don't know Michael Callahan, Michael Callahan was a resident of Medford lifelong. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1427.891s">Born</a> and raised in the Fulton Heights on Saunders Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1430.853s">He</a> was someone who worked in government tirelessly for his whole career. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1435.217s">Senator</a> Bullock, Senator McKenna as the Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Racing, the Chief Steward of the National Association of Government Employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1443.526s">In</a> 1978, he became the founding member of the Medford Consumer Commission, a commission that still exists in this community today that we fund through a line item in our budget every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1453.457s">Michael</a> Callahan was elected to the Governor's Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1455.58s">He</a> served 12 years as our Governor's Councilor representing the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1460.106s">Upon</a> the conclusion of Michael's 12th year, he passed away on the day that his successor was sworn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1467.918s">Michael</a> never got <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1469.192s">an</a> opportunity or a chance to enjoy his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1472.094s">But</a> I think what Michael really enjoyed more than anything was the 50 years of public service that he was able to put in to the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1478.8s">He</a> was a Vietnam veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1480.041s">He</a> was the author of the Veterans Buyback Bill, which allowed public servants in the police and fire department to buy back military time to put it towards a creditable service. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1489.188s">He</a> was someone that was a forward thinker. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1490.889s">And</a> most importantly, he is the man that saved Wrights Pond from development. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1495.453s">Local</a> legends would say that back in the early 80s, <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1498.835s">A</a> developer came in looking to purchase large portions of land around Wrights Pond to build condominium developments and Michael Callahan led the charge to start that development and here we are some years later and we still have Wrights Pond as a beautiful natural asset to the residents here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1514.502s">If</a> you go up to Wrights Pond tomorrow, you'll see the Michael Callahan monument up there that's been kept in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1520.044s">by</a> our staff at the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1522.304s">And</a> annually, I take the time to remember my friend, Michael, a mentor of mine, someone who I sadly miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/y31vTPCB2oY&t=1529.766s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support me in remembering Michael and the fine work that he did for the people of the city of Medford.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=917.288s">Mr.</a> President, I didn't realize that we had a copy of the rendering in our package as I went through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=921.492s">I</a> bypassed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=923.954s">And</a> in looking at the rendering, if we look at number 93 Mitchell Avenue, on each side of the property line, there is a existing, there will be a telephone pole, and then we'll be putting a new pole in. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=936.417s">Now,</a> unless that house doesn't have a driveway, or the driveway goes right down the middle of the property, it looks like this pole is going to be very close to the driveway at 93 Mitchell Avenue, should they have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=952.766s">And</a> I'd hate to get into a situation where we approve a pole to go up in a location where if we move it five or six feet in one direction or the other, we would improve someone's access to their drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=968.567s">Is</a> the city engineer on the call by any chance, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4480.574s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4482.395s">And</a> I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Patrick for all he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4487.256s">I</a> echo the sentiments of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4489.276s">I</a> think when we talk about Patrick Gordon, we know that he's good at and loves what he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4495.818s">And</a> I think that the most embarrassing part of this whole thing is that we're actually putting Patrick in the limelight right now, because he's usually the man behind the scenes operating like a cat in the dock, someone that's always bouncing around from meeting room to meeting room, making sure the Zoom calls are set up, making sure that Zoom call's set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4512.487s">And</a> he's done an amazing job, not only with bringing these meetings to the public, but also with the efforts and the work that he's done with our public schools through the Metro Community Media Lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4523.373s">Over</a> the past 10 months or so when we've been in this crazy world, I've had the opportunity to get to know Patrick very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4529.836s">And</a> I consider him TV royalty, access television royalty, the count of TV three. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4536.699s">He</a> does an unbelievable job and he's someone that I really respect and thank for all the work that he's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4541.14s">And</a> I'm glad that he received this award because it's a reflection of the hard work and dedication that he's put forward to his position, to the pride he takes in his job, and to his commitment to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4550.024s">So</a> I'm very grateful to call Patrick Gordon a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4553.287s">The</a> Council TV3 in the City of Medford does an unbelievable job, Mr. President, so congratulations, Patrick.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4818.178s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4820.2s">As</a> you're well aware, and my council colleagues are, the Warren articles are actually a copy of the bills that we pay at the end of every month. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4826.468s">And</a> when we talk about transparency in government, one of the things we always hear is, follow the dollar, follow the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4833.536s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, if we are going to be a transparent community financially with an open checkbook, that this council is made aware of where the money is being spent and when it's being spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4844.32s">For</a> example, our vendors that are providing testing for COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4849.642s">have</a> to get paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4850.682s">Are</a> they being paid? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4851.542s">Do</a> they have a balance? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4852.963s">How</a> much money have we invested in COVID testing? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4854.723s">Is</a> this money reimbursable through the CARES Act or the HEROES Act? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4857.684s">This</a> is good information for us, Mr. President, to have to make solid, strong financial decisions moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4863.085s">So</a> absent the fact that multiple requests have gone unanswered, I do think that this is a good legislative <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4870.638s">in</a> action, because it will provide us the opportunity to receive this information on a monthly basis required by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4876.861s">And</a> then after that, we will have that information at our fingertips to disperse and spread to those people that have questions, to maybe possibly adopt a council record, a council rule where we read it into the record at the beginning of every month, what we spent money on the previous month. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4891.366s">So</a> there's that fiscal and financial transparency here in the community, Mr. President, that we hear so much about. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=4896.088s">So</a> with that being said I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and ask that the city solicitor draft an ordinance for us to review to peruse and debate and in the meantime she can also send across a freedom of information request for us to get those Warren articles that we've been waiting for for an extended period of time so that we can begin to examine those as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5172.519s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5174.48s">In</a> recent months, we've had a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5177.797s">meetings,</a> public hearings related to special permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5180.378s">But</a> more importantly, we've had a lot of discussion relative to the codification of our existing ordinance and the potential to expand the special permit granting authority to various bodies in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5191.362s">You</a> know, one of those bodies is the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5193.722s">And</a> from what I understand, a lot of the proposals that are going to be coming back to us relative to the codification of our zoning are going to require some city council special permit issuance, some changes to the issuance of permits and the governing authority of the special permit granting authority, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5208.167s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it would make sense for us to take a look at the existing requirements that are currently filed with the city clerk's office as required by city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5216.271s">Review</a> them to see if they're up to date and up to par with the information and materials that we need to make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5221.694s">So</a> I think that this is an opportunity for us to review the way that we do business, the way that we conduct business, the type of materials, maps, and other type of information that we require as we deliberate and discuss creating special permits in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5234.941s">I</a> think it will provide us with an opportunity to be more informed, better informed, and also for an opportunity for us to review and update the existing requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5242.524s">For</a> example, we have a lot of talk about special permits and our ability to require the developer to conduct a traffic study or pay for a traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5251.368s">But</a> our existing requirements might not necessarily speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5254.89s">So</a> I think that there's an opportunity for us to review these and to strengthen them to put us in a better place to address issues that require special permit granting authority, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5262.674s">So</a> I ask my council colleagues to support this quest for review of information and hopefully an opportunity to improve the way that we do business and do things a little bit better than we are.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5364.948s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5367.51s">Earlier</a> this evening when our meeting opened up, we started off with a public hearing relative to a grant of location on Mitchell Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5374.473s">And</a> the procedure was we call the public hearing to order, we read it into the record, and then we ask if people are opposed to or in favor of the project that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5384.512s">Then</a> we close the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5385.734s">Then</a> we allow the petitioner to provide us with a presentation as to what the project's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5394.966s">Over</a> the years serving as a Councilor, one of the things that's frustrated me is the process and the way that our public hearings are conducted. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5401.42s">because</a> we're asking people whether or not they're in favor or opposed to a project that they haven't seen a presentation on yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5407.702s">A</a> lot of times, individuals in this community get their local news through the city council, and the first time that they see an issue on the agenda is at this public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5418.406s">So</a> what happens is the council's having a public hearing, people are offering opinions as to whether they're in favor or opposed to it, then we're closing the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5426.208s">Then</a> we're turning the floor over to the developer, or the applicant, I should say, <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5431.01s">And</a> the applicant gives a presentation, the council asks questions, and then we vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5435.132s">I</a> think it might make more sense for us, Mr. President, to have the petitioner give a presentation as to what the application is before the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5441.595s">So</a> that individuals that may not know if they're opposed or in favor of the project have an opportunity to understand what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5448.924s">before</a> they're asked to come up and speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5451.385s">Secondly,</a> what this proposal would do, and I really don't care what the language in terms of where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5455.766s">It's</a> something that's going to have to be hashed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5457.126s">This</a> isn't something that is at the end of the line discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5460.807s">This</a> is just a launching pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5462.387s">But</a> when the public hearings closed, the council then usually votes on the matter immediately thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5467.629s">And</a> there's no waiting period. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5469.089s">So</a> the public hearing closes, and then they said, OK, now on the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5471.59s">Is</a> everybody in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5472.29s">But</a> OK, sure, we'll grant it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5474.675s">Because</a> people don't necessarily read the council agenda and see what's on it, and there are individuals in the community that might get their news and understanding from community access, from the great work that Patrick Gordon is doing on account of community media. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5485.287s">It</a> might make sense for us, Mr. President, to allow a six day comment period for individuals to express whether or not they're in favor or opposed after the close of the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5492.615s">before</a> we take the matter up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5494.476s">It's</a> just a pet peeve of mine as to the way that things operate and I'm hoping that maybe we can take some steps to correct the way that we do it and improve the way that we do it so that individuals are more informed when they're speaking at public hearings whether they're in favor or opposed to them and so that residents in the community after hearing the presentation from the administration get the I mean the applicant get the opportunity to chew on it for a couple of days <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5514.809s">and</a> then decide whether or not they are in favor or against it, and send that information to us so that we can read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5519.631s">Food</a> for thought, as we say, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5522.173s">So</a> with that being said, this is something that, you know, I'm not too concerned about it passing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5525.874s">It</a> can go to subcommittee, it can go to committee of the whole, whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5529.056s">I'm</a> comfortable with the language, but I wrote it, and this is the first time most people have seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5532.457s">So,</a> you know, I certainly have no problem with this going through its diligent process. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=5536.879s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the matter, to be referred either to the rules committee or committee of the whole for further discussion, debate, and deliberation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6392.299s">I</a> just asked that when the subcommittee does meet that they invite the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6396.903s">We</a> recently had a report back from the city assessor that we have a high volume of homes in this community that are owner occupied, whether they're single family residences or multi-family residences, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6407.872s">And</a> we also have people that are homeowners that are taxpayers that are hurting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6413.275s">People</a> that own a home that are also suffering from the same effects that COVID-19 is putting on people that are renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6422.579s">And</a> the question comes as to what relief are these homeowners being provided if they're unable to pay their tax bill to the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6429.583s">We're</a> assessing, what, 18% penalties for individuals that are unable to pay their tax bills on time at this point in time, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6434.745s">I</a> think it's 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6436.717s">So</a> if we're going to look at a relief package, I think we have to have some equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6441.041s">It's</a> not just about evictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6442.422s">It's</a> not just about people that are renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6444.924s">There</a> are homeowners in this community that are suffering too, homeowners in this community that are struggling, that have to pay a property tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6451.297s">And</a> there's an area where we could also help. <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=6453.62s">So</a> I'd ask that the city assessor be invited to the housing subcommittee meeting for her input in that regard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/v8c6yqLwu5E&t=7108.979s">Mr.</a> President, before we start public participation, I'd like to make a motion to cancel next week's meeting in the interest of holiday celebrations with our families.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_r8CjiaVVNxs/2024-11-19_r8CjiaVVNxs.html">City Council 12-15-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=174.834s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=176.849s">Some</a> maybe four years ago, the DPW implemented a practice where they would use asphalt to replace sidewalk panels with the intention of coming back at a later date and replacing them with concrete when concrete crews are out performing the type of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=191.374s">But</a> what I'm seeing is that it's becoming <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=196.091s">few</a> and far between that these asphalt replacement panels are actually replacement panels, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=201.457s">They</a> stand there, I think, far past their shelf life, and they're degrading at a rate that would be much faster than that of our concrete sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=208.865s">Plus,</a> they don't necessarily have the same curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=212.829s">And</a> just not as aesthetically pleasing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=214.81s">So</a> we've seen issues across the community where asphalt sidewalks have been put in front of the Morris Memorial Hospital, for example, and other places where the neighborhood really hasn't liked the look of it, hasn't wanted that to be the standard that's acceptable in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=228.059s">And</a> I really don't think it is an acceptable standard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=230.541s">So</a> with that being said, I'm asking that the DPW discontinue the use of using asphalt sidewalk replacement panels and revert back to using concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=238.526s">or</a> some other semi-pervious material, Mr. President, that has a little bit more curb appeal than that of a black asphalt.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=286.121s">To</a> me, the continuity of aesthetics, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=289.929s">To</a> remain, to have some continuity in the aesthetics.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=471.531s">Mr.</a> President, I feel as though this is a rather self-explanatory resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=475.033s">I'm</a> just asking to know what it is, what approach it is that the city administration intends to take when vaccinations become available in our community, what the sites are going to be, what the locations are going to be, who the priority individuals to receive the vaccination will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=488.383s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that this paper be forwarded to the administration for a written response.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=522.603s">Motion</a> to table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=530.466s">One</a> week, yeah.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=534.198s">Whatever,</a> we can always take it off the table if it doesn't have a date on it, but yeah, that's fine, next week is great.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=552.582s">Just</a> put it on next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r8CjiaVVNxs&t=553.442s">Next</a> week.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc/2024-11-19_L-hLu0ibDYc.html">City Council 12-08-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=188.415s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=192.119s">Yeah,</a> I do believe this paper was before the council previously and the council said we have no problem with entertaining the idea provided that they provide us with the dates and locations as to when these food trucks are going to be operating in our community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=252.115s">I</a> don't recall voting in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=254.617s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=255.338s">I</a> don't recall voting in favor of this paper, Mr. President, previously.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=260.94s">It</a> was contingent upon them submitting the dates to us for further review to dates and locations for further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=265.821s">But</a> it wasn't something that we said, yeah, okay, do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=267.882s">Just</a> go five locations anytime you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=270.683s">We</a> still wanted to know the dates and times and locations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=398.313s">I'm</a> not here for a TV show.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=403.717s">So,</a> Mr. President, ultimately, I believe the food truck licensing process was established as a pilot program, if I'm not mistaken, well before my time on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=412.584s">And</a> I guess my question is, has this <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=414.342s">application</a> process change now? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=416.144s">I</a> mean, are we doing things differently than we were previously based upon the nature of the applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=420.308s">And</a> if so, maybe that's something we need to talk about because the council has prioritized the food truck ordinance as something that we want to look at moving forward on through the ordinance subcommittee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=431.118s">So</a> if there's any changes to the application process that's going on, it might be nice for us to know about that as well so that as we <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=436.784s">further</a> discussions on the food truck ordinance, we can have some of the input that the administration's had based upon the applications and the nature of requests that they've seen over the course of the last year or so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=714.424s">I</a> certainly appreciate their willingness and desire to want to work with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=718.725s">We</a> have a number of great establishments in Medford, like Roswell's Restaurant, for example, does great work here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=724.307s">This</a> councilor just recognized Richie for the work he does in his philanthropy here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=729.07s">So,</a> you know, we have a number of businesses that want to do good things for the people that live here that are based here in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=734.352s">I</a> did hear that the way this is is they want a blanket permit and then they want to come back to the council to tell us when they're coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=740.814s">Well,</a> that's pretty much the way it works right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=742.814s">If</a> you want to come, you just tell us what the date is and the time is and you come before the council with your application and we'll hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=747.836s">So,</a> I'm a little confused as to why we're changing the process when the processes seem to work pretty well in the past and if, you know, it's like not like they're going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=755.878s">If</a> they don't know, there are people here that are going to buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=757.779s">It</a> sounds like it's pretty much just, does your neighborhood want to do delivery from this pizza place today? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=761.701s">Because</a> this pizza place will come to your neighborhood with the truck and bring you the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=765.623s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking at this and I'm kind of saying, we're changing the process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=771.326s">It</a> seems like the process that we've had in place previously is a process that would work just fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=775.549s">They</a> have a date, a time, and a location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=776.949s">If</a> they want to go to a neighborhood, come before us, petition us, and we'll vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=780.551s">But</a> a blanket permit and the changing of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=784.829s">material</a> application of the food truck pilot program, which shouldn't be called the pilot program anymore because it's been in place for like nine years, you know, is ultimately problematic to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=794.679s">And</a> this is a paper that, you know, I don't think we need to deviate from the way we've been doing things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=799.463s">I</a> don't think this makes it any <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=803.166s">better</a> for the community, any more protections for our business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=807.39s">Just</a> based upon what I'm hearing right now, maybe my mind can be changed and I can be swayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=811.654s">But</a> I just kind of, I'm starting to get the feeling that it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=815.963s">It</a> doesn't matter what the rules say. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=817.084s">We're</a> just doing anything, however we feel like doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=819.646s">And</a> then when anybody says anything about it, it's coronavirus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=823.73s">So</a> I'm a little confused by the way the application process has changed and the way that the criteria has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=829.755s">With</a> that being said, I'm not opposed to food trucks in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=832.017s">I</a> think we should have an ordinance, and I think we should allow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=835.04s">But</a> I think it needs to be tightened up a little bit more than what we have here presently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=838.703s">The</a> proposed ordinance is far more restrictive than what's been outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=842.646s">this</a> document right here, for example, the proposed ordinance would say that if you are going to be located within 200 yards of a brick and mortar establishment, you have to get their permission to locate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=853.014s">So</a> there are some things I think that, you know what I mean, safeguards that we can put into the community, and that's what we've been working on through the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=859.338s">So,</a> you know, when I look at this, it's not something that I'm comfortable supporting this evening right now, I'll tell you that.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1938.134s">I</a> think it needs to be reviewed by legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1940.035s">And</a> the reason I think that, Mr. President, is because we can't request that an entity or an organization waive their rights under federal law as a condition of permitting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1950.641s">So</a> I think that that's something that might need legal review from Solicitor Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1955.444s">But</a> I would like to offer a C paper, Mr. President, requesting that Monogram Foods and the administration meet with Boston Building Trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1966.747s">to</a> discuss the potential for a project-specific labor agreement at this house, at this location for the build-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1973.228s">And</a> that gentleman would be Francis X. Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1975.549s">He's</a> the Chairman of the Building Trades at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1977.529s">I'd</a> offer that as a C paper, Mr. President, if this is approved and moving forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2500.707s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2502.088s">I'm</a> going to tap it on my zoning book here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2503.829s">Section</a> 94-145, hours of operation of retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2511.373s">A,</a> no retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant shall conduct business or operate in a single family general residence, apartment, commercial, or industrial zone between the hours of 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2521.119s">and</a> 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2522.78s">A</a> special permit to extend those hours of operation between 11 and 7 may be granted by the council provided in section 9481. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2529.908s">So</a> it appears that the extended hours permit would be applicable in this instance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3177.457s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3178.977s">Point</a> of information, Councilman Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3180.678s">It</a> appears that this project would be subject to linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3183.078s">Would</a> the administration be willing to dedicate the linkage fees that are generated through this project for improvements to Middlesex Avenue for partnering with the state in making those improvements?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3316.312s">Yes,</a> linkage fees apply, and yes, we'll be willing to do it, and no, we won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3319.414s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3319.934s">That's</a> as simple as I'm looking at you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3326.659s">Okay,</a> why would linkage fees not apply at this location?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3337.703s">Renovation</a> over a certain size. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3339.564s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3339.945s">A</a> substantial reservation in excess of 50% of the structure that's 10,000 square feet, which is what this project is, I believe, based upon what was presented.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3392.377s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3392.637s">But</a> we can't partner with the state, just like we've seen neighbors in Malden do, for example, when they partially funded a study for the reconfiguration of the Highland Avenue-Fells Way intersection there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3406.106s">And</a> the city put up some money to do the traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3408.648s">And</a> once the traffic study was complete, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3410.429s">the</a> state kicked up the money to do the repairs.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3717.652s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3718.952s">And</a> Mr. Monica, I want to thank you for your patience in going through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3723.135s">I</a> know it's quite an initiation to the Medford City Council that you've taken over the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3728.177s">And</a> I as one council want to say, number one, it's great to see that your company wants to invest here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3734.121s">Ultimately,</a> there is zero jobs at this location now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3737.345s">And</a> with the approval of this TIF, we have the ability to bring 250 jobs to our community, plus the construction jobs that are going to be related to it, plus we're going to be able to redevelop an underutilized site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3748.762s">And</a> from my discussions with the city assessor, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3752.507s">If</a> nothing happens at this property, then we don't lose anything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3755.589s">I</a> mean, right now, it is what it is based upon the way the tip is structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3761.332s">In</a> order for us to move forward on this, we're going to be in a much better place than we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3765.894s">So</a> why is one councilor uncomfortable supporting this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3768.815s">I</a> think we've raised a lot of issues, A paper, B paper, C paper, D paper at this point, Mr. President, and they're all valid, valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3780.502s">more</a> focused, not necessarily on the merits of the organization or the business that's going to be done, but the application in the seamless transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3788.191s">to</a> a renovation of a site that's located in the neighborhood and our ability to make sure that those that are responsible and accountable to make sure that certain aspects of this job go right do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3800.078s">So</a> when we talk about linkage and we talk about the solar ordinance, we're talking about items that we want the applicant to know about and know what they're getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3808.543s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3811.304s">This</a> evening, I'm very comfortable voting to support this TIF. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3813.867s">I</a> think we've done a good job vetting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3816.229s">We've</a> taken the opportunity to open our eyes and our ears to the neighborhood and the neighbor's concerns, while also examining the economic benefits that it's going to bring to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3825.857s">So</a> I, as one councilor, will be supporting this paper this evening, and I would move forward for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5350.486s">I</a> think it might make sense for us to outline what votes we took in the subcommittee meeting earlier in the evening so that the people understand what it is that they are either opposed or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5361.015s">Right</a> now it's, are you opposed to a paper that would determine a residential factor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5367.779s">I</a> don't think that that's really a very indicative of what exactly on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5372.781s">I</a> think it might be better off set if you know, we had a little breakdown as to what each of these four items meant and what the council voted on in the subcommittee meeting so that we could move forward in that regard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5405.569s">I</a> think, I mean, ultimately the council voted in subcommittee to determine that we would adopt the lowest residential factor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5413.033s">So</a> the issue before us is whether or not we want to, people are in favor of us adopting the lowest residential factor by having a single tax rate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5422.013s">And</a> I mean, I think that's as simple as the explanation goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5424.275s">I</a> know when we get into the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption, the explanation might be a little bit further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5430.3s">But</a> a brief synopsis, I think, would be warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5432.862s">We</a> don't need to get into the law books on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5440.828s">So</a> maybe we go through the votes that we took, the council voted to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5443.33s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5443.971s">And</a> then Ellen can explain what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5445.292s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5469.819s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5475.801s">Sounds</a> good to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5476.642s">Okay,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5576.476s">I</a> do believe it was not recommended by the administration to adopt such at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6113.67s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6114.491s">Motion</a> to adopt the lowest residential factor to be used for FY 2021, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6696.921s">Motion</a> to adopt an open space discount.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7028.618s">And</a> just on Councilor Marks' point, Mr. President, looking at the math and the numbers that were put before us this evening, that 4,000 households looks like it represents about almost a quarter of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7040.584s">So</a> that would be one in four paying more, even though they're owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7045.586s">And</a> I think that's very important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7047.147s">So,</a> you know, I think that, you know, garbage in, garbage out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7050.348s">You</a> can only make good decisions with good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7052.029s">And</a> that's what we need to focus on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7080.335s">Motion</a> to adopt a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7082.417s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8376.822s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8378.703s">Mr.</a> LaRusso, thank you for coming this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8380.984s">I'd</a> first like to start off by saying that your abilities nor is your character in question this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8388.565s">I</a> got a phone call from a dear friend of mine, Chris Murphy, raving about your character and the type of person that you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8396.068s">And</a> his opinion that you'd be a great fit in Medford, and that goes a long way with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8403.431s">You</a> know, personal relationships that I have with individuals in the community and their opinion mean a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8410.237s">I'm</a> certainly no prude, I have tattoos. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8412.479s">Not</a> too happy that I got them when I was a young kid, but I got to live with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8415.621s">They're</a> forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8417.043s">And</a> I think that you're well aware of the concern that some people in the neighborhood have and some people in the parish have relative to the location of the studio and the aesthetics that may or may not be present there upon opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8431.585s">And</a> I do have a specific request, and I'm hoping to be willing to entertain it, would be that you conduct a community meeting with the neighbors and with the residents in the parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8442.954s">To</a> explain to them exactly what it is you're trying to do down there, and what direction you're looking to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8449.058s">I</a> certainly have no issue with the tattoo shop in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8452.88s">I</a> voted for one just a couple weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8456.763s">I'm</a> no prude by any means. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8458.724s">But</a> there are certain concerns that have been raised by my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8461.606s">I</a> live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8462.346s">I</a> live within walking distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8464.127s">I've</a> heard about this application before I knew about it when it was coming across our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8469.311s">And</a> it's been an issue of concern for some of the residents that live down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8474.375s">So</a> I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8477.865s">with</a> the hope that you'll be willing to conduct a community meeting or an open house of some sort to allow people to come down so you can explain to them what it is you're doing, what it is you're trying to do in the neighborhood, and address some of the concerns that may have arisen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8490.857s">Ultimately,</a> because this is a special permit that's before the council, we do have the ability and the right to attach special conditions upon it, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8499.805s">I'm</a> not thinking this is going to be a tattoo parlor that has vulgar pictures hanging in the windows right across the street from a church that just doesn't fly anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8508.932s">The</a> days of those type of tattoos are over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8511.273s">This</a> type of art form has transformed from bikers, veterans, and people in jail to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8518.578s">The</a> barista at the Starbucks has a tattoo now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8521.4s">The</a> Reverend in Sanctuary Church has a tattoo, everybody has tattoos. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8524.281s">They're</a> commonplace, they're normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8526.861s">But</a> that doesn't alleviate some of the issues that have been brought up to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8530.502s">So</a> I'm asking that you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8532.223s">I'm</a> on your own, I have no problem supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8535.323s">However,</a> I would ask that you at some point in time prior to opening, conduct just a small meeting with the residents and the neighbors and members of the parish to tell them what you're doing and to kind of explain to them what your aesthetics are going to be like so they don't have any fears as to any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8552.549s">Imagery</a> that may be offensive to the practice of their faith.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8634.254s">Mr.</a> President, I just asked that we put a <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8636.452s">90-day</a> review on it, just to be sure that the meeting happens and if any issues pop up, we can bring them back in and sit down and talk about what we can do to resolve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8646.46s">It's</a> not a mechanism or a vehicle for us to come and yank your license away from you after three months or anything like that, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8651.945s">I</a> don't want you worrying about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8653.286s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8653.866s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8654.246s">What</a> it is is it's a mechanism for us to address some of the concerns that may come up during the first months of operation so that we can come up with a plan so that you can live harmoniously with the residents.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8900.445s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10329.297s">Mr.</a> President, the notes I have say, I said, why don't we move to have a committee of the whole with the MWRA and National Grid over the project and mitigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10336.02s">I</a> mean, ultimately, National Grid wouldn't even be here if it wasn't because MWRA asked them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10340.322s">And</a> as I looked at the heat map just a couple weeks ago, the map that allows us to take a look at the gas leaks in the area, we've had a significant number of gas leaks along that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10350.446s">That</a> we're going to remain on that street is gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10352.547s">National</a> Grid admittedly had no intention of coming down there and repairing any of those unless they really had to, unless they were grade one gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10359.47s">You</a> know, so I'm looking at this project and I'm saying to myself, you know, National Grid was never going to come here unless MWRA asked them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10369.516s">Now</a> that they're coming here, they are going to make repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10372.058s">Okay,</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10373.359s">But</a> this isn't about the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10374.599s">This</a> is about mitigation to the residents in the neighborhood that are going to be forced to put up with the construction that's going on down there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10380.623s">So</a> the one question I do have would be for the city engineer and it's, you know, is there a code relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10388.692s">a</a> safety code or a building code or a construction code relative to sidewalk and curving height in relation to the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10397.055s">And</a> if there is, when we're allowing these public utilities to come in our community and restore them to equal or better condition, we're really letting them come in and establish something that's not up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10413.545s">I</a> mean, if someone were to come into this building, when we built the new police station, we had to make sure that it met the seismic requirements that were necessary for a building of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10421.954s">We</a> had to take into consideration the floodplain and all these different other items when we were building a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10428.161s">When</a> we renovate buildings, we talked about the renovation of certain homes in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10433.887s">And</a> we have to bring those homes up to code when they're given a building permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10437.31s">So</a> I guess my question is, is there a code relative to sidewalk height in relation to the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10441.853s">And</a> why are we allowing public utilities to come into our community and restore them to the condition they were in and not up to code if there is in fact a code? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10449.419s">Which</a> there probably isn't, that's why we're letting them do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10645.093s">And</a> in terms of the gorilla in the room, the elephant in the room, whatever you want to call it, MWRA, have you sat down with MWRA and discussed the further criteria of the mitigation agreement or the requests and recommendations that your office has related to their project when they come on board? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10664.823s">Or</a> is this still a little premature for that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10711.545s">Mr.</a> President, I think at this point, I'm very comfortable echoing the sentiments of Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10721.605s">The</a> city engineer just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10723.046s">These</a> three parties haven't even been in the same room. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10725.929s">So</a> I would suggest an offer in the way of a motion that we have a committee of the whole with the MWRA National Grid, as well as representatives from the administration to discuss this permit and mitigation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10903.077s">Just</a> a couple of weeks ago, Mr. President, a similar item came upon the agenda and we discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10908.838s">It's</a> very important when we get updates from bodies, boards, commissions, the administration, that these updates are provided to us in writing so that we have that snapshot in time so that when the item comes up again at a later date, we have something to compare it to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10921.68s">And</a> I'd hope that that still stands.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12447.467s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12448.848s">I</a> don't know if it's the result of flushing or whatnot, maybe some underground utility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12454.553s">But</a> for about nine to 11 days over the past two weeks or so, there's been a tremendous amount of brown water in South Medford neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12465.262s">Sometimes</a> actually stretching all the way up to the back end of High Street, over by the river, near Mari's restaurant actually, up the street more or less though towards the barbershop and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12476.811s">the</a> jewelry store, Rollins and VIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12479.417s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I've gotten a number of complaints stretching from Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12487.088s">all</a> the way back to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12488.97s">So</a> I'm asking the DPW Water Department to provide us with an update as to what's going on, why there was so much brown water in the area for such an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12496.957s">You</a> know, a lot of people were a little upset when they were trying to make the mashed potatoes and they ran the water and it was brown on Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12503.483s">So</a> I'm just hoping we can get some clarification and address some concerns, Mr. President, as to what's going on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12909.4s">Mr.</a> President, didn't we vote on a paper that was very similar to this, asking the mayor to appear before us and she agreed to appear before us periodically to give updates?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12924.769s">I</a> think she said Perry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12926.272s">I</a> think the mayor's response is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12928.135s">It</a> was periodically. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12929.597s">I</a> don't think it came out monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12931.08s">It</a> came out periodically. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12933.063s">But</a> it's my understanding that the statistics data and the like are all compiled on <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12938.913s">Wednesdays,</a> and they have their powwows on Wednesdays relative to this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12942.476s">So</a> we'd be getting the week before's information if we did that on a Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12948.842s">But</a> whatever direction we go when we go, and Mr. President, I just again request that we get this in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12954.206s">I</a> feel like our meetings are turning into more like television shows and less like meetings.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13400.13s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13401.491s">What's</a> this, a motion to table the rest of the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13403.913s">Absolutely</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13404.874s">It's</a> to suspend the rules.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13416.684s">You</a> know he's on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13418.305s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13500.455s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13502.577s">Are</a> these parking spots right now, are they business only, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13507.13s">I</a> think just regular parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13508.391s">Just</a> regular parking?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13510.111s">They're</a> not marked.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13521.817s">Is</a> it the sponsor's intention to reserve these spaces just for business permits? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13526.679s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13532.101s">People</a> can't park, so they need lines?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13540.533s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I vote in favor of this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13657.058s">Approval</a> is amended.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13675.37s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13678.392s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13678.692s">Vice</a> President Ferriero? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13679.192s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13679.272s">Seven</a> in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13679.793s">Motion</a> passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13680.713s">We're</a> under suspension, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13681.854s">The</a> records?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13822.704s">I'd</a> like to offer a B paper, Mr. President, on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13825.987s">I</a> mean, it builds right upon what Councilor Bears is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13829.772s">It's</a> the narrative and the spin that's put on certain issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13833.896s">I'm</a> offering a B paper asking what the criteria is for a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13842.082s">Over</a> this past week, we all got robocalls concerning certain business establishments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13848.345s">That</a> was the only robocall I ever got about a business establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13851.427s">I've</a> never heard about any other establishments ever in this community that have ever had any type of outbreak or any type of contract tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13858.97s">So</a> it's very concerning to me, Mr. President, especially based upon the current circumstances in the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13865.993s">where</a> one out of five is unemployed, where we're seeing a lot of small businesses closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13870.277s">I</a> think sometimes taking a deep breath and thinking a little bit before speaking makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13876.181s">I</a> know I'm certainly guilty of not doing that a lot of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13879.964s">But</a> ultimately, I'd like to know what the criteria that's being used is for a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13885.114s">notification</a> to the community relative to COVID clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13887.915s">Is</a> there a policy or a protocol? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13890.156s">Is</a> it just, you know, when I feel like doing it, I'm going to do it or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13894.138s">I</a> mean, because I think that, you know, every action has a reaction and the reaction that the community has can be very damaging to small businesses if our ducks aren't in a row and our facts are not accurate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14116.917s">I</a> don't want to remember this, I want to forget it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14284.177s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14286.119s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14286.799s">I</a> think during these trying times, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14290.253s">placing</a> more restrictions and more burdens on businesses and eating establishments is the last thing we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14295.356s">If</a> I go to Carol's restaurant and I sit down and I want to have something to eat and I say, no, Mari, keep the silverware. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14300.759s">I</a> don't want the silverware, I want the plastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14302.46s">Or</a> I can, plastic by request, I just don't understand it, Mr. President, if they send out a delivery to a house or a work establishment, then they get a phone call, there are no forks and knives, can you bring them back? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14313.586s">I</a> mean, it puts an impact on the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14316.247s">When</a> it comes to cost-saving measures and cost-cutting measures, businesses do a pretty good job policing themselves and regulating themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14322.09s">And</a> if this is something that they want to implement, they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14325.031s">But</a> I just don't think at this point in time, further regulating and further burdening businesses, especially, mostly these are small businesses that do take up business, is the right thing to do at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14336.396s">So</a> for that reason, I'll be voting no.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14775.697s">I</a> was just going to ask if Mr. Costas was still on the call from the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. President, but I think he goes to bed at 930.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14807.436s">I</a> have the floor, Sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14808.197s">So</a> there was there was a couple of a couple of amendments that were put forth.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14886.148s">We</a> can put it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14886.989s">You</a> just take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14887.95s">Either</a> way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15104.472s">Councilor</a> Marks, I'll answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15105.472s">The</a> reason I offered the motion was because in 2017, in 2019, in 2020, we've tasked the city solicitor with drafting an ordinance relative to short-term rentals in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15117.381s">Between</a> 2017 and 2019, there was a series of litigation events and other regulatory parameters that were established that created a criteria that would now allow a community to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15130.031s">So</a> I know I've sent <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15132.96s">the</a> solicitor's office at least 50 pages worth of documentation, a white page report on best practices on how to regulate short-term rentals and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15145.183s">And</a> in the last discussion that we had with the city solicitor, it was that she was working on a draft, still to date, I do believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15152.385s">And</a> the reason to send this to her would be to have her review it and contrast it with what she has already worked on to see if there's any items in here that might be <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15160.707s">left</a> out and then present it back to the council for us to review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15212.514s">The</a> ordinance subcommittee just met, what was it, last month and we prioritized several papers that were in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15218.138s">The</a> first paper I believe was, we had food trucks, we had sick leave bank, we had short term rentals, we had small cell wireless towers were the four top items that we discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15230.066s">There</a> might have been one other in there out of the five, but <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15232.621s">you</a> know, right there at the top of the iceberg from important items that the subcommittee was going to be working on to put out as a work product to this committee of the whole as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15241.646s">So</a> with that being said, maybe we send it to the subcommittee that's working on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15246.749s">And</a> we could take some of the ideas that are in this and contrast it with what the city solicitor gives us when she does.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15343.809s">I</a> do believe when the paper was initially introduced in January, Mr. President, and the clerk may be able to take a look in the records if he hasn't before him, the prior paper was joined to it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15356.992s">The</a> prior paper was joined.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15361.953s">The</a> paper from the previous session that we were working on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15366.674s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15367.335s">The</a> paper from the previous session was joined to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15370.531s">And</a> now the paper from the previous session still remains in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15375.496s">And</a> it's never been reported out of the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15377.959s">And</a> the reason it hasn't been reported out of the subcommittee is because we're waiting for the information from the city solicitor's office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15540.41s">Motion</a> to table subcommittee reports for the next meeting, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo/2024-11-19_TH89eXSxkYo.html">City Council 12-01-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4007.801s">I</a> think, and I don't want to speak for my colleague, but I think what he was asking was if the paper for $740,000 was amended or the police supervisor position was sliced out, I don't think you'd get much pushback from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4020.149s">I</a> think we all understand that there's a need for that, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4022.421s">Um,</a> the question is whether or not we want to support a supplemental budget for 740 K. Um, and there are some items in there that, um, some of us have concern over and some items in there that some of us, um, uh, some items that aren't in there that some of us have, um, but I think all of us behind this rail would be supportive of a standalone paper to amend the supplemental budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4042.849s">Um,</a> so that we didn't have to go through the process of using the existing funds in the police budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4047.23s">so</a> that we can use those funds to hire the dispatchers that we so need. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4050.032s">We</a> want to hire this police dispatch supervisor, a dispatch center supervisor, so that they can perform in-house training. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4057.776s">If</a> we can't get the training done at the state level, we need to get it done somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4061.198s">They</a> need to keep their continuing ed certifications up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4064.359s">We've</a> heard from <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4065.889s">Lieutenant</a> Rudolph saying that, you know, there's really no one that's in either department that's qualified to perform the functions of training. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4072.437s">So</a> I'm just trying to clarify, Zach, I think that's what you were getting at, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4076.943s">Is</a> that if you give us a paper that's for the, you know, whatever it is, $100,000 or whatever that line item was, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4083.651s">I</a> don't think the council will stand in the way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4085.813s">Um,</a> that still leaves the argument relative to the other items that the council has been discussing and the other items that are on that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4091.439s">Um,</a> however, you know, I think it'll address the issue of the nine one one call center supervisor, uh, in relatively short order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4437.767s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4439.629s">The</a> mayor said something relative to the supplemental budget and how if it's not passed this evening, then it dies and the money would revert to free cash come the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4449.316s">Is</a> there anybody from the administration that can speak to the impact that this will have on our levy limit, our new growth? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4458.669s">for</a> the upcoming fiscal year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4509.424s">So</a> it wouldn't apply to the levy limit for the next fiscal year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4514.386s">And</a> is any of this money applying to new growth for the next fiscal year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4544.16s">and</a> the benefit of increasing the city budget is because it would allow you to have an increased levy limit next fiscal year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4579.642s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4581.163s">Just</a> one second, Michael, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4582.583s">But</a> what I'm saying is if the budget is amended, the levy limit is based upon the previous year's budget, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4591.289s">How</a> much money we were able to generate? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4593.33s">How</a> much money we spent?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=4631.16s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=5506.262s">I</a> just have one quick question before you pass it off, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=5515.143s">I</a> just heard if Monogram Foods comes here as opposed to is Monogram Foods coming here or is it contingent upon whether or not we give them this tax incremented financing? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=5524.605s">I</a> mean I'd hate to see us pass it and have them shopping around from city to city to city and then say wherever they get the best deal they're gonna go but we're making a commitment to them is there a commitment back you know I mean that this is where they want to be or is this a shopping spree?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7454.394s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7456.716s">It</a> appears to me that this would be what's classified as a bakery wholesaler. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7460.638s">Am</a> I correct in making that assumption?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7484.995s">And</a> in this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I do believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7489.317s">Because</a> you'd be considered a bakery wholesaler and you'd be subject to USDA approval and inspection, you wouldn't be subject to the authority of the local board of health, is that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7508.76s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7510.241s">And</a> we talked a little bit about the jobs that Monogram's going to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7515.065s">And</a> I'm relatively familiar with Monogram Foods from my day job working in the insurance industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7520.609s">And</a> I understand a lot of these positions are packaging jobs and manufacturing almost type jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7527.674s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7528.815s">And</a> then you'd have also a smaller array of positions that were mid to upper level management and then you'd have some drivers?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7550.358s">And</a> is there any local hiring preference that's part of the TIF? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7555.302s">I'm</a> sorry, any local- Local hiring, if you're located in Medford and you have two applicants, and one of them's from Medford and one of them's from Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7563.142s">Does</a> the Medford person get the job? <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7565.043s">Is</a> there a local hiring preference?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7599.532s">There</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7599.872s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7600.352s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7600.573s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7600.753s">Thanks,</a> Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7601.754s">It's</a> in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7603.535s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7605.517s">Well.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7607.077s">I</a> personally have supported tips in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7610.042s">I</a> think that it's a great way to jumpstart our economy and bring jobs to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7615.612s">The</a> jobs that pay $20 an hour, the jobs that pay $800 a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7620.987s">Those</a> aren't necessarily the jobs I'm crazy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7623.31s">I'd</a> like to see jobs that pay a living wage so the people that work here can live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7627.414s">And</a> that hiring preference isn't going to go too far if the people working there are going to make 800 bucks a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7632.439s">With</a> that being said, there are other positions and other jobs and other benefits that come with having an employer of this size in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7638.045s">But</a> I would agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7639.386s">In</a> the past when we've done this, we've taken a slow and deliberate approach to be sure that we don't all arise cross LRTs and also listen to the concerns that the residents have. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7649.97s">In</a> looking at the location of this facility, it's, I believe, located in an industrially zoned district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7656.212s">a</a> wholesale bakery can be stationed there by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7659.834s">The</a> option, the ability for the council to bring this entity to the table right now is purely based around this TIF. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7666.497s">So</a> I think it would be a good exercise for us to allow the opportunity to entertain Councilor Mark's motion, and I would second it or support it if he offers it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=7676.281s">And</a> move from there, but this is something that historically I've supported, and I certainly see no problem with it based upon the preliminary presentation that's been made, but I would like to hear from the residents as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9307.955s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9309.756s">Over</a> the course of what's been about two summers now, two and a half years now, I've been working with National Grid to get the level two gas leaks repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9319.239s">They</a> would be right on Boston Ave, right around the corner of Harvard Canal, right in that stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9326.062s">And</a> I've been getting a lot of complaints, Mr. President, from residents in the neighborhood when I'm out down the park walking and the like, that the condition of the roadway is so poor, <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9337.852s">Coupled</a> with the gas leaks, the people are very concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9340.134s">Their</a> houses are shaking when trucks are coming down off Route 16, down Boston Ave to Route 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9347.3s">And</a> I'm hoping that we can provide these residents with some relief from the heavy trucking and the noise and impact that it's having on their quality of life and the foundations of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9357.649s">Through</a> no fault of their own, but for the fault of the fact that our public utilities repair our roadways terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9363.033s">and</a> that street maintenance is not the greatest, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9366.096s">So</a> with that being said, I'm asking that my council colleagues support this resolution to request that no trucking be posted or implemented along that stretch of the roadway until such times as these infrastructure and public utility problems can be addressed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9425.988s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this was brought to my attention through a very famous resident on Mystic Street, one of Councilor Caraviello's neighbors, a gentleman who's very involved in a number of issues in the community, whether it be the Chevalier Organ Society, or Trees for Medford, or the Shepard Brooks Estates, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9443.193s">But</a> Mr. Krause sent an email out identifying this tool that Google's put out, allowing communities to use Google's mapping technology <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9453.876s">to</a> determine what areas in their community could benefit from more tree cover and tree canopy to address the issues of urban heat and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9465.239s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was a very good idea and a very good opportunity for the city of Medford to implement some technology that we haven't had in the past and for us to move forward in addressing some of these concerns that we have over the degradation of our tree canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9477.422s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper and move approved.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9537.042s">Mr.</a> President, I will withdraw paper 20652 as the matter is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TH89eXSxkYo&t=9543.824s">Mr.</a> President, I will withdraw paper 20653 as the paper is scheduled for a committee of the whole tomorrow evening.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_WziW6Oj7skY/2024-11-19_WziW6Oj7skY.html">City Council 11-24-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2608.29s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=2610.032s">Mr.</a> President, I believe it's the sponsor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3183.2s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3184.06s">I'd</a> just ask that Lieutenant Rudolph be invited to the meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3187.262s">I</a> thought he did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3188.818s">when</a> it came down to explaining the need for the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3191.159s">He</a> talked a lot about cost savings measures in terms of internal training and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3195.001s">I</a> thought his presentation was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3197.462s">I</a> thought his presentation was far better than the emails that I've received over the course of the week since that presentation closed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3203.565s">This</a> is a position I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3204.925s">I</a> think it's a position we all support. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3206.806s">And</a> I'm a firm believer that there's a couple ways we can go about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3210.288s">We</a> can go about carving this piece right out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3212.824s">If</a> that's the case, if it's such a public safety emergency, they can carve this piece out of the paper that's before us and on the table and present it to us separately, individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3221.151s">When</a> we think about the paper that's before us for $740,000 and you look at it, $200,000 of those dollars is money for a facility's operations account. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3231.672s">And</a> $300,000 of those dollars are to fund union contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3234.653s">So</a> that's more than three-quarters of the payable that are made up of funds that aren't funding positions, but funding things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3242.055s">Not</a> people, but things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3243.456s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly understand the need to get this done before we set the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3248.74s">And</a> I certainly feel as though there is room for compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3253.243s">I</a> think that the chief of staff made a decent attempt at it, but without the buy-in from his boss, it was very difficult for him to commit to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3261.848s">And</a> I certainly would support moving forward in that regard, where we reduce the facility's management account by $100,000 and set that money aside to fund an elections coordinator position. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3272.996s">I</a> also said last meeting that I'm not too crazy about Robin Peter to pay Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3277.383s">And</a> that the administrative assessor, the facilities management positions are positions that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3283.485s">This</a> council's requested in the past, and we're getting something we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3287.147s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would move forward and support the resolution to have a meeting discussing the public safety concerns down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3294.43s">But</a> I'd ask that Lieutenant Rudolph be invited to attend as well, because he gave such a great presentation last time that I don't want that to get lost.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3366.921s">Well,</a> the paper says to invite the two chiefs of police and I'd like to add him. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3369.902s">So</a> that's making that request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3373.965s">But</a> to Councilor Bears' point, if in fact, you know, we have the paper, the paper's been tabled, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3595.481s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3596.662s">I</a> echo my colleague's statements and sentiments to understand how important <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3602.02s">this</a> is to the city of Medford and the region is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3605.963s">To</a> have our congressperson as the assistant speaker of the house means that we're going to have direct access to a variety of funds and resources that the federal government is able to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3617.611s">And</a> we're going to be able to do so through our congressperson because we all understand how important seniority and leadership roles play in the United States House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3626.357s">So</a> with that being said, it's very good to see Catherine Clark be nominated to such a position. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3630.4s">She</a> earned it on her merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3631.801s">She's</a> done a great job since she's been elected, replacing Senator Markey at the time, I believe, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3637.485s">And</a> since that time, she's done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3639.147s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I echo my council colleagues' sentiments and I move for approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3769.426s">Mr.</a> President, before the vote is called. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3770.926s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=3771.606s">If</a> we could send correspondence to the Congressperson recognizing that we recognize her achievement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4318.65s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4319.411s">Now</a> this is the same facility that when COVID-19 broke out, we had an inordinate number of deaths at, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4366.565s">Okay,</a> so it doesn't apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4367.426s">They</a> own both of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4368.607s">So</a> it seems to me like, you know, we have a... <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4371.649s">this</a> facility in our community that's designed to help people when they're sick. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4375.931s">And</a> they're not paying too much attention to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4378.352s">And</a> actually they're putting our community in danger at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4380.653s">They're</a> not paying attention to the COVID-19 guidelines and now they're housing, you know, an inordinate number of sex offenders here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=4387.595s">It</a> seems to me like we might want to do a little bit of a review to see if this is someone that we want to be doing business with in this community and whether or not we want to still see them as a permanent entity here in Medford.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5319.953s">It's</a> also often that this council requests updates from the administration and the updates from the administration come in the form of someone appearing before the council, which is all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5328.22s">I</a> don't think any of us have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5330.502s">But</a> there's also the black and white response on a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5334.731s">Which</a> is very nice to have as well, Mr. President, because if we're asking for updates on certain programs or measurables, we have it in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5341.114s">And</a> then we can look at the old update and the new update and see how far we've come. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5345.316s">And</a> I think that that's something that's been lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5347.017s">So</a> moving forward, I think it will be very important for us when we ask for updates from the administration that we get those updates in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5353.415s">First</a> and foremost, if the administration wants to come and appear before the council and be on the big screen here, that's okay, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5360.76s">But</a> I think that getting it in writing is probably more important than anything else at this point, Mr. President, so that we can have a file on a topic as opposed to going back and watching old meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5369.807s">When</a> was that meeting again? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5370.708s">Oh,</a> let's go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5371.528s">How</a> many minutes into it was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5372.789s">Oh,</a> it was 17 minutes and 22 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5374.81s">Okay,</a> hit start. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5375.571s">Let's</a> see where we were from the last time we were here versus the update that we can have in writing and put in the file. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5379.814s">So</a> I think that's very important, Mr. President, moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5382.756s">make</a> that request that the administration provide updates to the council in that fashion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5389.344s">I</a> will make it a B paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=5629.159s">Thank</a> you, Jackie.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6176.755s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WziW6Oj7skY&t=6176.955s">On</a> the motion.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3aghgs5t794/2024-11-19_3aghgs5t794.html">City Council 11-17-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=334.533s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=335.774s">This</a> paper was before us last week, and it's a paper that looks to increase the fiscal year budget by $740,000 to fund union contracts, early retirement incentives, and various other services and positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=349.225s">Over</a> the course of the last week, as this matter was tabled, we did receive some documentation from the administration, job descriptions and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=355.87s">With</a> that being said, I'd like to have the paper brought to the table for a further presentation by the administration, and hopefully a vote for this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1558.24s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1560.547s">I</a> think the chief of staff is looking for 90 days to finalize the job description, have a meaningful conversation, and come to a final point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1570.874s">May</a> it make sense for us, because there are other positions that are associated with this that I feel are important, like the 911 supervisor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1577.078s">I</a> feel like it's a very important position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1578.759s">And</a> I'd hate to see the 911 supervisor position go unfunded for an extended period of time because we're having a dispute. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1584.022s">about</a> a position that's not on the paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1587.747s">We</a> all have our thoughts and our concerns about the registrar of voters' recommendation or opinion as to whether or not this position is needed, number one, what their thoughts are on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1597.181s">Number</a> two, is this position going to be a bargaining unit position? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1600.35s">Is</a> this position going to have supervisory authority over the staff in the voter registration office? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1605.372s">These</a> are some questions that need to be hashed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1607.813s">So</a> I'd offer that we give the administration 45 days to finalize the job description, convene with the registrar of voters, and report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1617.285s">And</a> we can move forward on the paper that's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1620.267s">There</a> are some items on the paper before us this evening that I'm not crazy about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1623.228s">I'll</a> be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1623.889s">But</a> there are some things in the paper before us this evening that I feel are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1627.871s">And</a> the facilities manager and the administrative assessor and the 911 supervisor are three positions that we have job descriptions for that I think are a critical need in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1638.476s">So</a> I think that there's room for compromise and the ability for us to compromise on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1643.259s">I</a> just don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1646.52s">because</a> we do have three positions that we do need to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1649.861s">And</a> I also don't want to see the money disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1653.142s">So</a> with that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1655.623s">But</a> I think that, you know, there has to be some middle ground and some compromise that we can reach here in order for us to move the ball forward on the elections coordinated position, but at the same time address some of the needs that this council has requested and voted for in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1668.886s">So</a> with that being said, I can appreciate where everybody's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1671.727s">However,</a> I do have concern about that 911 supervisor's position in particular.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1831.039s">No,</a> no, I was just getting ready to call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=1832.4s">I'm</a> the third one, you know, so I hit my mic.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2899.755s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2901.056s">I'm</a> very familiar with this portion of the city, this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2905.338s">Is</a> this gas main going to be connecting to that construction project on Medford Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2910.401s">Is</a> that what 87 Medford Street is, that big building that they just built there on the border? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2914.843s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2915.464s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2915.844s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2916.604s">And</a> forgive me if I missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2920.566s">How</a> long is the construction going to take for this 532 feet?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2926.49s">Two</a> weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2928.14s">And</a> when is the construction going to be performed during the day, during the night?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2935.727s">Tim?</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2966.315s">Is</a> it possible we could just have a pre-construction meeting with the abutters on the roadway before the work begins? <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2973.247s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2973.947s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=2974.387s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3118.012s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3119.354s">In</a> addition to Leo's role in Democratic politics here in the city of Medford, he was also a great family man, a great husband, lived on Jackson Road for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3127.281s">And</a> I can first remember meeting Leo as a young kid, first getting involved in politics, working for Senator Shannon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3133.267s">And</a> Leo pulled me aside down at the West Medford Spa and talking to me about <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3137.671s">Various</a> issues going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3139.572s">So</a> I remember Leo running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3141.252s">I</a> remember Leo chairing the Wood Six Democratic City Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3144.333s">But</a> most of all, I remember Leo being someone who genuinely cared for people and went out of his way to give a kind word, to help out people in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3154.015s">And</a> just as a young kid, to give me a pat on the back and tell me to keep doing what I was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3157.516s">So</a> it was very motivating, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3158.816s">He's</a> going to be sorely missed, and I'm sad to see him go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3162.197s">So</a> with that being said, I echo Councilor Caraviello's condolences.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3504.928s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3505.649s">This</a> was a review of some of the ordinances that we've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3510.448s">Working</a> on, we went through a number of items on the agenda that were outstanding and have prioritized those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3517.012s">We</a> will be reconvening next month to go over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3520.454s">There</a> are a couple of items that we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3522.596s">Extended</a> illness leave bank for city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3526.818s">$15</a> minimum wage for city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3531.801s">Councilor</a> Marks's small cell tower ordinance was something that actually came up in the discussions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3538.345s">And</a> I'm missing something here, I'm leaving one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3540.327s">Councilor</a> Morell, help me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3544.09s">Short</a> term rentals, that's exactly what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3547.312s">She</a> sponsored that so I was throwing it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3550.054s">So</a> Mr. President, we made some great progress and we've developed an action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3553.817s">We've</a> prioritized the papers and we're going to be moving forward hopefully to a committee of the whole with a work product for us all to review and be proud of.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3596.459s">Long</a> and in order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3597.859s">Move</a> approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/3aghgs5t794&t=3599.179s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc/2024-11-19_TKixPlxrhGc.html">City Council 11-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=163.039s">Mr.</a> President, I offer this paper this evening to suspend the rules so that we can take up paper 20559, paper 20634, and 20635, relative to the finances of the city of Medford and appropriations thereof.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=181.83s">OK,</a> 634, 635.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=207.111s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this was a paper that the council had kicked around for some time during our budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=211.795s">We</a> talked about how it would be a good idea for us to get quarterly updates as to where we were in terms of our financial stability, our projections, and whether or not we're meeting, exceeding, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=223.123s">So</a> I had the opportunity to speak with our finance director this afternoon, and she is prepared to join us this evening and present us with a presentation where we stand three months into the fiscal year after the passage of our budget at the close of the month of June.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=894.283s">I</a> defer to you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=898.845s">Either</a> way, I'm satisfied with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=901.126s">I'm</a> very happy with what I'm hearing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=902.867s">So</a> maybe we can move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=990.239s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=991.56s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=992.74s">And</a> through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=993.761s">Nunley,</a> that was an excellent presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=995.222s">And</a> it's very encouraging to hear what we're hearing in terms of the financial picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1001.645s">So</a> this year's fiscal year budget relies on about a $5.5 million free cash appropriation to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1008.989s">And</a> based upon what I'm seeing now, we are achieving about, what, $2.5 million of an increase in state aid from what we budgeted for, if that's correct, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1019.775s">Nunley?</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1021.625s">So</a> that takes up about half of that structural deficit that we budgeted with the $5.5 million for free cash appropriation?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1036.532s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=1037.432s">And</a> looking at moving forward based upon these projections, do you think that we're going to be on pace to eliminate that structural deficit with our receipts?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2395.51s">Mr.</a> President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2396.351s">I'd</a> like to just amend the paper and request that we receive a copy of the Warren Articles from January to date and monthly thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2404.219s">The</a> Warren Articles are where we spend our money, the bills, and how we paid for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2408.064s">So</a> I'd like to add that in the form of an amendment, Mr. President, or a motion to amend the paper if we want to move forward on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2414.553s">But</a> it sounds like we have an update on the HVAC system and a copy of the Warren articles from January to date and monthly thereafter as amendments to paper 20559. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2424.443s">We</a> have a lot of discussion, a lot of talk about the other two papers that are on the table, and those are the money papers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2429.968s">I'm</a> very satisfied with the presentation that we got this evening, so I'm going to be bold and suggest that we take this paper to a vote and we move on to the money papers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2756.16s">I</a> do believe that document does exist and then recently we also asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2762.053s">a</a> report on whether or not we're using outside council to negotiate salaries, negotiate contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2768.516s">We</a> got a response to that as well, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2770.297s">So</a> we've gotten a couple of responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2771.658s">I</a> mean, I think it might even warrant a committee of the home, Mr. President, if that's the case, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2776.561s">So</a> we can all get on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2777.701s">I'd</a> certainly be willing to entertain that as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2886.989s">Speak</a> to that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2890.211s">An</a> item of this much severity, I just would like a brief presentation from the finance director, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2896.375s">We're</a> taking a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2897.096s">We</a> took a $5.5 million vote some months back and we're taking a vote now for 700K. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2903.7s">So</a> I think it would make sense to get at least a presentation to bring us full circle.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2931.302s">So</a> this 703,000 represents the $703,000 in new growth that is above and beyond the forecasted estimate at the close of the last fiscal year?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=2945.171s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3104.407s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3105.528s">Through</a> you to the Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3106.629s">So</a> if I'm understanding this correctly, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3108.898s">We're</a> asking for a $200,000 appropriation to go into the negotiated salaries account.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3117.162s">That</a> funding would or would not be subject to further appropriation after the contract is settled?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3136.819s">Because</a> the past practice has always been that the administration negotiates the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3142.923s">They</a> provide us with the opportunity to vote on the compensation package and fund the contract at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3150.589s">So</a> this seems to be a little bit different than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=3153.972s">Is</a> that safe to say?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4018.096s">In</a> looking at this, I certainly agree with my colleagues in their positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4021.139s">I</a> have concerns over the $300,000 in union contracts and only retirement incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4026.425s">I</a> also have a concern over the $200,000 in facility maintenance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4028.186s">That's</a> $500,000 of a $740,000 paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4028.667s">But</a> there is one item that I look at, Mr. President, on this list, and that's the 911 supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4042.138s">And</a> this is a position that's my understanding was created out of need and necessity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4048.745s">So</a> I'm wondering if there's anybody available from the administration to talk a little bit about this expense, if a job description does exist for it, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4056.012s">I</a> know that as we've been transitioning from professional to civilian dispatches, we've had some bumps in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4063.6s">a</a> need for us to revisit this, then we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4066.042s">When</a> this council moved to support a move to civilian dispatching, we did so as a cost savings measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4071.766s">But</a> we don't want those cost savings measures to get in the way of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4075.569s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, for a $70,000 appropriation salary expense on this, I'm hoping that the administration has a type of job description. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4085.896s">And</a> the reason I say that is because there was somebody that was already doing this work before. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4090.079s">It</a> went to civilian dispatch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4092.001s">So</a> if there's anybody available that could speak to this, I think that that might be very helpful for us in preparing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4096.984s">I</a> mean, the paper is going to get laid on the table no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4099.446s">So</a> it's not going to be voted on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4101.127s">But</a> if there's someone here that can provide us with some of that information, I think that'd be very helpful.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4488.402s">I</a> just want to thank you, Lieutenant, for that presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4491.003s">I</a> think that that made me feel very confident and comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4493.864s">Moving</a> forward, when I do take a vote on this paper, that that's something that I will be supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4497.245s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=4714.393s">Motion</a> to waive the reading and reconvene the hearing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5661.396s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5662.938s">I</a> don't think anybody behind this rail cares how much it costs because once you guys pack up your trucks and put your shovels in your car and you drive away, we're stuck with the mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5671.086s">So</a> we don't really, I don't think anybody back here cares what it's going to cost National Grid.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5834.352s">What</a> this sounds like to me, Mr. President, is almost, you know, the street opening permit gets issued and the street gets ripped up and there's an obligation to restore the street to its previous condition, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5846.141s">And</a> if we have one entity that's gonna do that and pay for it, there's two utilities that are involved, MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5855.688s">Well,</a> the obligation is to restore it to what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5859.378s">So</a> it's almost like a double recovery, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5861.9s">We're</a> getting paid for the same scope of work twice, but it's only getting done once. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5866.905s">So</a> I think that's what the preclusion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5868.406s">We're</a> getting paid double time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5871.868s">for</a> the work that's being performed because one entity's responsible for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5875.589s">The</a> person that closes the street's responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5877.99s">So</a> that money's getting spent by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5880.171s">And</a> that's going into the community to restore it back to that original condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5884.073s">Anything</a> above and beyond that, I think, would be like a double recovery on the impact of the mitigation, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5889.415s">On</a> the impact of the assessment above and beyond their obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5893.216s">That's</a> what it sounds like to me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5895.418s">But</a> I can understand what Councilor Marks is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5897.36s">We</a> were given a paper here that says, approve it with these conditions and these conditions aren't being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=5903.246s">So</a> I guess the question is, does the city engineer want us to approve it with the conditions that he's put forth aren't being met?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6429.317s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6430.197s">So,</a> Mr. President, what I'm hearing here is the city engineer saying Riverside Ave is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6436.342s">Riverside</a> Ave needs a new gas line. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6438.564s">It's</a> leaking everywhere and the city has been requested it for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6442.378s">I'm</a> hearing Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6443.499s">Cuddy</a> saying that this isn't a planned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6447.261s">This</a> is a project that we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6448.902s">Most</a> likely, they're holding their nose in doing it because the MWRA has an easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6454.385s">And</a> because of that, they're not willing to expend any extra dollars or resources in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6459.448s">That's</a> the way that sounds to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6462.27s">MWRA</a> wants the work done and they have an easement, so now they're willing to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6465.692s">The</a> city was calling for the replacements of the gas mains due to the leaks, and they weren't willing to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6470.555s">This</a> was not a planned project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6472.697s">So</a> I guess the question is, if the MWRA didn't want to do this work, would National Grid ever even be looking at replacing this gas line?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6493.83s">Right,</a> so we have a street that has multiple level 2 gas leaks on it, that we've all made phone calls on, that National Grid wasn't willing to fix, but now they will fix it because the MWRA needs access to their easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6508.097s">We</a> are getting some community benefit out of it, in my opinion, Mr. President, because if the project doesn't go forward, the gas main doesn't get fixed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6515.607s">So</a> at the very least, we're getting the gas main fixed with the approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6520.373s">But</a> I commend the councilor in his position on this because <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6524.678s">This</a> is something that we have all talked about, but most significantly, Councilor Marks, the level of the pavement on Riverside Ave with the sidewalk is something that, as long as I've been on the council, he's been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6536.862s">And</a> I don't blame him for pursuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6538.303s">If</a> he sees an opening, pursue it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6540.483s">Try</a> to get through that crack and get that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6542.304s">So</a> I certainly have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6545.625s">And</a> I think that he's doing a great job advocating for the residents in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6552.235s">On</a> the side of things, on the flip of the coin, we are getting 1,500 new feet of gas main that wasn't going to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6558.097s">And</a> based upon the commentary of the city engineer, that gas main does need to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6563.758s">And</a> it's full of leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6564.499s">And</a> the city's been asking for it to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6566.459s">So</a> it's a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6567.44s">It's</a> a conundrum, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6569.62s">That</a> coupled with the fact that the grant of location for MWRA has already been issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6573.781s">And</a> they have an easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6575.142s">They're</a> replacing their pipes in the same location that they're granted to exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6579.924s">So</a> they're not going to have to come before this body again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6582.568s">But</a> the people that are going to have to come before us are the National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6585.172s">So</a> I can see exactly why National Grid is on the hook for some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6593.795s">I'm</a> of the inclination to support the paper just based upon the simple fact that the gas line wasn't going to be done ever in the foreseeable future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6602.981s">The</a> city engineer has indicated that it's one that does need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6606.463s">So</a> that's going to be a benefit to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6609.165s">However,</a> I will support my council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6611.413s">this</a> evening if he's looking for more information or the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6616.817s">Just</a> from my view of it, Mr. President, it feels as though this is a forced project, a project that's being forced on national grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6622.282s">So</a> they're not really willing to discuss anything because they don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6626.205s">They</a> have to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6627.626s">And</a> then MWRA is coming in and MWRA already has the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=6630.088s">So</a> they're not really over a barrel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7299.36s">This</a> question is for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7300.16s">Cuddy,</a> Mr. President, through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7302.802s">Based</a> upon what I've heard, it sounds like National Grids <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7306.618s">not</a> willing to do anything extra because they don't have any rate payers to pass the cost off onto.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7394.506s">Once</a> we give you the permit, what leverage do we have to get everything?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7401.928s">Mr.</a> President, through you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7405.469s">Cuddy,</a> does National Grid have a charitable division?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7420.382s">Certainly,</a> in lieu of this language, the city would be very willing and welcoming a donation equivalent to the amount of money that it would have cost for us to have that portion of the street resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7431.789s">And</a> then those funds can be placed in the general fund and then appropriated whichever way we'd like to see them appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7438.093s">So</a> there is opportunity and options, it sounds like.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7455.84s">When</a> we built the park right across the street over here, National Grid gave us five grand.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7462.823s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7463.844s">We</a> asked, can you give us a donation to build a park? <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7465.744s">And</a> they said, yep, here you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7466.665s">Crystal</a> Campbell Peace Garden, here's five grand. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=7471.055s">So</a> now we're asking for a donation to build some sidewalks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8027.993s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8028.914s">So</a> as I understand this, Mr. President, this is going to come straight across the street from my parking lot, cut a little bit through our parking lot underneath some bushes and trees, and then go right to the Harvard Vanguard building.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8042.984s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8200.173s">Would</a> any of those items that the engineer needs to look at and discuss with the commissioner result in potentially further recommendations for conditions of approval?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8232.744s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8233.204s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8233.765s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8234.105s">Thanks</a> Tim.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8247.53s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8765.933s">Mr.</a> President, if I may offer a B paper in relation to this, it's also related to sidewalk panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8774.545s">Only</a> this B paper is related to the sidewalk panels that would be located outside of the former Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8780.693s">Just</a> this past week, we had a bit of work being done along that stretch of Lawrence Road between, let's say, Governor's Ave and Lawrence Road, right to the entrance, the old entrance to the emergency room, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8793.661s">And</a> they ripped up the sidewalk panels, and they did some work, and then they put sidewalk panels packed down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8798.403s">And</a> we used to have nice gray concrete sidewalk panels, and now this asphalt cold patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8805.407s">So</a> I'd like to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8807.424s">to</a> our friends at Lawrence Memorial Hospital as to whether or not this is a temporary or permanent patching. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8814.069s">Because</a> I certainly do not find it acceptable that they take out the concrete sidewalking, which quite frankly, there was nothing wrong with, and replace it with this asphalt sidewalking, Mr. President, that doesn't fit in with the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8827.159s">Well,</a> actually, it does fit in with the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8829.16s">Actually,</a> it doesn't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8830.281s">The</a> reason it doesn't is because if you look directly across the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8833.833s">At</a> the bottom of Summit Road, you'll see seven sidewalk panels that are gone, that haven't been there for five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8839.962s">All</a> right, so on one side of the street, we're tearing up the entire side of the street that has a nice concrete sidewalk, and we're replacing it with black asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8847.388s">And</a> across the street, where we have a stump that needs to be taken down, the stump's been there for, I don't know, I think it was 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8855.033s">Now</a> the sidewalk's been ripped up, but the sidewalk hasn't been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8857.995s">So</a> on one side of the street, we're tearing it up and we're replacing it with an inferior product. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8861.418s">But</a> on the other side of the street, it's just being ignored, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8864.18s">So</a> I believe that's something that needs to be addressed in post haste. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8867.853s">And</a> I'd offer that in the form of a B paper, and I thank the council for bringing this measure forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=8966.626s">Mr.</a> President, the reason I offer the table is because Councilor Marks made a number of amendments when we took this paper up and those amendments still have not been integrated into the document.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9180.33s">Are</a> they referring to when Officer Brooks did traffic counsel there for the Thanksgiving weekend a couple of years ago, maybe?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9285.223s">Is</a> that the same process that they use, Councilor Marks, to put up all those pylons all around the city and what they did down in Tufts Square?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9816.005s">28th</a> doesn't work for me, Mr. President, but I'd just like to ask that a robocall be made to all the residents of the streets for whatever date you do decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9822.887s">The</a> 28th is right after Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9825.648s">I'll</a> be traveling.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9836.511s">We're</a> going to have neighborhood residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9838.551s">We</a> don't want to wake them up at six in the morning.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9947.173s">I</a> think we have to be cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9948.394s">I</a> think we have to be cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=9949.795s">Um,</a> if we have so many people from the traffic commission, then they'll reach a quorum.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10412.253s">Mr.</a> President, I thank the council for bringing this forward and there's another contributing factor to the dangerous intersection and that's our MBTA buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10422.33s">at</a> that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10423.091s">And</a> what happens is we'll have MBTA buses that come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10425.714s">That's</a> the terminus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10426.375s">That's</a> the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10427.436s">So</a> that's where now the route ends and starts right in front of the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10431.361s">And</a> we'll see buses that come down and they stop on Winthrop Street right at the end of Place that Road, making it very difficult for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10441.761s">to</a> come out of place that road, take a left or a left-hand turn to go down Route 38 into Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10447.29s">So</a> what you're seeing is a lot of cat and mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10450.055s">And</a> we're also seeing a lot of these buses that sit there for 10, 15, 20 minutes idling. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10456.921s">abutting</a> the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10458.922s">So,</a> you know, I think that's also a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10460.783s">And</a> in the past, we've passed council resolutions asking them to not put the buses there, to move the buses to a different location, to line them up along, place that road if they're making the loop, but those have fallen on deaf ears, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10471.589s">So</a> that's not the contributing factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10473.67s">So</a> I'd like to ask that we ask the traffic commission to review the location where the bus stop is and make recommendations to see if that's something we should move. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10482.635s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10485.416s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10721.748s">Councilor</a> Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10722.729s">Mr.</a> President, much like the airplane noise, they're not going to listen to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10726.851s">They</a> need to listen to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10728.772s">So</a> with that being said, I got two words for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10731.253s">Robocall.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10732.134s">I</a> think it might make sense for us to ask the administration to do a robocall alerting residents of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10737.777s">I</a> know a lot of us have transitioned from working in the city and relying on public transit to working at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10743.5s">But</a> there's going to be a day where we all have to go back, and when we do have to go back, <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10747.702s">I</a> think that we should have a quality service, the service that our assessments reflect. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=10752.803s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask that a robo-call be made as part of this paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11277.689s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11278.809s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11279.689s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly support the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11281.65s">However,</a> if we think back to, oh, was it about a year ago where this council stood up and fought to ensure that Tufts University and the related construction crews were not staging materials on the field behind Nolwood Road in College Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11301.618s">That</a> was a big point of contention when they wanted to create a whole staging area for the whole entire construction project over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11307.121s">And</a> as a compromise, Tufts University agreed to set up the staging areas where they have down closer to the end of College Avenue at the intersection of Boston Avenue, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11319.128s">So</a> I just want to be clear that a yes vote for this paper in no way, shape, or form changes my position that that field should not be used for a staging area. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11328.433s">And</a> I don't think that that's the will of this council either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11330.953s">I</a> just want that to be very clear that the council isn't saying, hey, listen, I know you have all this land back there, so use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11337.695s">Because</a> we've specifically asked them in the past not to.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11506.569s">It's</a> offered by Councilor Marks and I, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11508.63s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11510.777s">It's</a> offered by Councilor Marks and I. It's a congratulatory resolution and it reads, be it herefore resolved the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere congratulations on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary to Ronald and Joanne Crotty of Playstead Road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11526.592s">And</a> I'll defer to Councilor Marks for commentary as he's the senior member in both age and service.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11605.474s">Councilor</a> Marks, that's a great presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11608.035s">Growing</a> up in West Medford, you know, the Crotty's house was one of those houses as a kid you knew you could always go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11614.057s">If</a> you needed a drink of water, you were hungry, you had to go to the bathroom, you were late to go home, and you needed to use the phone to call your parents, the Crotty's had an open door policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11621.859s">I</a> remember fondly the days of playing stickball down at the Gleason School, and Mr. Crotty coming down, making sure we're all set, bringing us extra tennis balls and waters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11630.081s">Just</a> a great family and I had the great privilege and pleasure of growing up with Jason and Janelle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11634.967s">I</a> spent a lot of time in that house as a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11637.49s">And</a> to think back now, when I was ten years old, running around in that house some 30 years ago, they were married for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11645.419s">It's</a> just amazing to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11648.121s">think</a> about now that I'm here married ten years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11651.164s">And</a> they were already married 20 before I could even think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11654.727s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11655.347s">So</a> I just want to wish Mr. and Mrs. Crotty the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11658.69s">Congratulate</a> them on 50 years and wish them 50 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11662.333s">And</a> like Councilman Locke said, Marianne Howell is Mrs. Crotty's twin sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11668.758s">They</a> all go together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11669.879s">We</a> lost her husband Tom a few years back and this council paid tribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11673.862s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, congratulations to Ron and Joanne on 50 years.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11810.09s">Have</a> a good night. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11810.53s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11811.351s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11812.492s">I</a> think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that a lot of these people that drive these trucks are actually still in the trucks when they're parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11819.357s">They're</a> sleeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11820.338s">They're</a> sleeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11821.259s">So</a> they're long haul truckers that are delivering foodstuff and products across America. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11826.363s">And</a> when they find a nice place to park, they're going to park, and they're going to sleep, and they're going to catch their rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11830.826s">And</a> we want them all to be well rested, but at the same time, not at a detriment to the quality of life in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11835.55s">What</a> Councilor Caraviello is saying is absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11837.851s">We've</a> seen an increase, an inordinate increase in the number of trucks that are parked on our public roadways, and it's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11844.195s">Councilor</a> Marks has always had a great idea, and that idea was the trucking unit with the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11850.319s">The</a> command of the weight and the size of the trucks that are riding on our public streets, as well as do some enforcement issues like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TKixPlxrhGc&t=11854.881s">So</a> I think that's something that we should revisit, but I thank the council for bringing this forward.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_S_jvt8DRKHw/2024-11-19_S_jvt8DRKHw.html">City Council 10-27-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=19.982s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=288.899s">Mr.</a> President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=290.901s">I</a> think it's important that we point out the good work that the Medford Mall, the 915 Elks does here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=297.788s">When</a> the city hall was being renovated, they donated their parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=301.251s">Every</a> flag day, they have a flag day celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=303.913s">Every</a> Memorial Day, they help decorate the graves down at the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=309.739s">They</a> do a great job decorating our war memorials here throughout the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=314.283s">And</a> the Elks actually gives out more scholarships nationwide than the federal government does, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=319.386s">They're</a> the largest private organization that issues college scholarships in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=325.31s">But</a> the Medford Mall and Elks have always been a great partner here in the city of Medford, and I thank them for the work that they do, and I will support this paper wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=395.293s">I</a> also think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that this will allow the Elks to begin their function hall business again where they're not allowing entities to come into function halls and do buffets and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=405.64s">The</a> Elks will have the opportunity to begin renting out their function halls based upon the capacity requirements that have been established by the Board of Health and then offer their own food stuff there instead of having an outside entity come in to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=415.067s">So</a> I think this is something that will help them with their business and their revenues during these trying times.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=584.687s">Mr.</a> President, motion to waive the remainder of the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=586.448s">I</a> believe the purpose section gave a good outline as to what this ordinance will do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=621.17s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to adopt the additional comments for review as amendments to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=625.775s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=977.687s">Mr.</a> President, is this a change of use or is this just a new business going in with the same use that's already existing?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=996.285s">So</a> you will not be doing the same type of work that Libby's Auto was doing?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1003.321s">Okay,</a> so yeah, just you're going to be, you're still selling pizzas, you're just selling it under a different name, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1009.526s">Yes,</a> yes, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=1011.868s">I</a> have no problem with it, Mr. President, we'll approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3356.57s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3357.77s">I</a> think it's important to point out that National Grid did submit this application in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3364.072s">And</a> we're just getting it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3367.135s">Is</a> there a plan to maintain any construction material or equipment along the public way during this project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3384.985s">Yeah,</a> it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3388.827s">We</a> just had a project on High Street in Woburn where every weekend there were 50 or 60 cardboard boxes filled with yellow pipes sitting on the traffic island that one of the neighbors spends a lot of time maintaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3405.538s">There</a> was a bulldozer in front of a historic home in a historic district on the corner of Route 60 and Woburn Street, which is a difficult intersection, number one, and also a highly traveled thoroughfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3419.027s">In</a> the past, I've asked the city engineer if, in fact, materials or equipment were going to be stored in a public way that a community mitigation agreement be entered into with the provider in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3435.716s">So</a> if you're parking a bulldozer in front of my house for six weeks, and I need a new sidewalk panel in my house, and you're doing asphalt work, why don't you replace that sidewalk panel in front of my house too? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3444.7s">Mitigation</a> issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3445.821s">And</a> as I look through this, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3448.275s">grant</a> a location application. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3450.708s">conditions</a> that are surrounding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3452.049s">A</a> lot of these, I think, are more focused on infrastructure stuff and less focused with community mitigation and community impacts that affect the neighborhood and quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3463.898s">So</a> I'd ask that no equipment or materials be stored on the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3469.682s">There's</a> plenty of industrial zoned land down between Hall and Linden in that area that's privately owned that I believe that the <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3480.107s">public</a> utility can secure to use as a layover or a layoff land. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3485.749s">But</a> I don't think we need to be using our public ways and our public roads for storage area, for materials and equipment, for projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3492.771s">And</a> I've said this consistently for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3497.053s">So</a> that would be the request that I make, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3499.093s">I</a> certainly have no problem supporting Councilor Mark's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3502.054s">If</a> he has questions that need to be answered, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3505.055s">So</a> with that being said, I would second his motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3516.42s">It's</a> like the price is right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=3534.234s">Absent</a> a community mitigation agreement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4572.684s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor, because I don't want to mislead.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4578.903s">It</a> should be noted that National Grid submitted two granted location petitions for the same scope of work with minor differences in routing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4586.005s">However,</a> the two plans are largely the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4587.865s">The</a> engineering division confirmed with National Grid that the petition dated 8-20-2020 is the correct petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4593.786s">The</a> other petition received on 9-8-2020 was discarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=4599.447s">So</a> it looks like there might have been some confusion with the plan design as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5246.409s">What</a> information council tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5247.749s">So</a> as of Thursday, all students grades K through 6 will be returning to school underneath this hybrid model?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5256.111s">So</a> they'll be having two days in and two days out?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5273.858s">Have</a> we done an audit or conducted an assessment to ensure that we are meeting the requirements for hours of education and hours of personalized instruction?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5297.07s">As</a> a parent, Mr. Murphy, and I'm not trying to be critical because I know we're all trying to get through this and learn, but this hybrid model, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5305.092s">I</a> feel as though it's significantly lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5306.953s">I</a> mean, I'm home with my child, doing the online portion of the education. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5313.858s">And</a> when they're on their self-directed learning days, I feel as though we could do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5322.003s">I</a> am very fortunate to probably have my son and one of the best teachers in the Medford Public Schools classroom, and he's been able to manage. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5334.737s">As</a> a parent, I'm very concerned about the direction that we're going in and our ability to provide a high quality education to our students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5343.787s">Because</a> I feel as though we're really missing the mark with this hybrid model. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5350.315s">So</a> the next question would leave me to ask with this hybrid model that we have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5355.46s">in</a> these investments that we're making to our high school and our other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5358.962s">Moving</a> forward, if the schools do open, the hybrid model is what we're going to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5362.205s">We're</a> not going to see full in-person learning from our students this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5366.027s">Is</a> that safe to say?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5398.433s">And</a> the public health guidance that we're working under versus, say, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5401.916s">Raphael's</a> or St. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5402.576s">Joseph's</a> is different?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5414.465s">So</a> based upon your presentation, I mean, listen, none of us know except for Councilor Marks, I think, because he went to the vocational school and he's a lot handier than I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5424.157s">based</a> upon my recent electrocution when I was trying to change a light bulb. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5430.24s">With</a> that being said, this assessment's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5433.742s">I</a> don't think many of us here are too interested in seeing how many particles per minute are being pushed through a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5438.704s">I</a> think what we all want to know is when a school's going to open so that the high school kids can get back to the high school, so that we can have a full complement of learning in person for our students K through 12.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5624.674s">We</a> don't have a date certain. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5625.696s">Do</a> we have a goal, maybe, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5627.219s">Is</a> there a goal date or a defined period of time we're hoping to complete these assessments? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5635.525s">A</a> lot depends on these answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5636.986s">A</a> lot of people's lives are affected by these answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5639.147s">A</a> lot of people have child care issues that they need to resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5641.489s">A</a> lot of people are paying money out of pocket that they weren't paying before for child care. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5645.431s">So</a> these are real life issues that affect people. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5647.792s">So</a> we're looking at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5649.914s">It</a> sounds like the high school is the biggest issue, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5651.655s">The</a> high school is the oldest building in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5653.756s">The</a> high school is the building that needs the most work. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5655.797s">Let's</a> take the high school off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5658.279s">Let's</a> look at the middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=5659.921s">We</a> have K-6 now, so we're looking at 7th and 8th grade to be the next age bracket that will be, I guess we'd say, let back in to school buildings.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10762.075s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10763.255s">In</a> terms of the two small grants, I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10766.576s">In</a> terms of the $125,000 appropriation for rental assistance, this is something that I've supported in the past, but I think it was important to point out that initially this council didn't support this paper when it was first brought before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10779.284s">And</a> the reason this council didn't support this paper when it was first brought before us was because these funds were not going to be maintained exclusively in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10787.49s">Community</a> Preservation Act funds are generated through an assessment on a property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10792.153s">And</a> when this program was first presented to us, people were going to be eligible from all across the state, not just Medford only. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10799.858s">And</a> this council worked with ABCD to ensure that only Medford residents were going to be able to receive these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10805.825s">And</a> because of that, if you look at the data that they've given us, you'll see that 35 applications have been approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10812.672s">The</a> aggregate amount requested is $101,679,000, the $102,000 that Councilor Morell was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10815.556s">In</a> reading this paper, you'll also see that <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10823.073s">35</a> applications have been approved for residents that live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10827.217s">49</a> applications were rejected because those people were outside the service area. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10830.26s">They</a> didn't live in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10831.701s">So</a> these restrictions that we put on this to keep these dollars in our community are paying off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10836.185s">They're</a> allowing us to service more Medford residents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10840.008s">and</a> keep that money here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10841.77s">If</a> we looked at the number of applications that came in and the number of applications that were kicked out because they weren't residents of the city of Medford, we'd see that this money would have been spent far faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10851.419s">And</a> these money, these are monies that are generated through property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10854.542s">So</a> these are monies that should maintain a space right here in this community and go no further than the walls of Medford or the borders of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10861.349s">I</a> think it's very important that we point that out, that the council did its due diligence the last time this paper was before us, and put some safeguards and protections in. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10868.757s">And</a> I would assume that these safeguards and protections would extend to the second appropriation, and I'd like to get that commitment from ABCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10877.786s">And</a> I'd also like to include that as a condition on the paper, should it be approved this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10889.827s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10890.188s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10891.308s">Music</a> to my ears, as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10893.73s">I'm</a> also looking at this report that was given. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10895.891s">It</a> says 35 households which have completed active applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10901.935s">The</a> aggregate amount requested is $101,679. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10904.157s">The</a> aggregate amount requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10907.038s">This</a> amount has been appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10908.8s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10909.5s">It</a> sounded like you confirmed that with Councilor Morell's questions?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10914.298s">So</a> the money's expended, gone, no longer in the bank.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10940.775s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10941.598s">All</a> right, so yeah, and looking at this, Mr. President, you know, addresses my concerns and my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=10946.765s">It</a> looks like, you know, the safeguards that we put in place are helping us meet the objectives of the program, and I wholeheartedly support the paper this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11963.757s">Do</a> you want to make that as an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11966.219s">Or</a> a condition of appropriation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=11991.219s">Then</a> I also had a question how much money do we have in the CPA housing reserve presently and I do believe last time the CPA was before us for this paper They were seeking us to appropriate 50% of the total at that point in time, so I'm just seeing where we are in terms of I think last time we were at about 550,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12012.086s">Yeah,</a> about $500,000 in the CPA trust fund when they came for the $250,000 appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12013.888s">We</a> took that $250,000 appropriation and we turned it into $125,000 appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12016.091s">So</a> I guess the question is how much money remains in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12018.213s">Roberta,</a> would you be able to answer that question?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12085.613s">Hold</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12085.834s">Let</a> me start with that because that confused me for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12087.615s">So</a> there's $250,000 in the housing reserve that's planned to be used for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12091.438s">All</a> the money in the housing reserve is used for housing, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12098.123s">I</a> think what you were saying is we have $250,000 there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12099.885s">There's</a> more money that we can put towards housing through other vehicles.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12146.615s">And</a> that money was transferred from the general fund, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12150.557s">Whoa,</a> whoa, whoa.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12153.719s">That</a> money that got transferred into the housing reserve was money from the general bucket that we... Yes, from the general bucket.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12167.847s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12169.048s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12199.04s">How</a> much money do we have in the bucket, in the affordable housing bucket?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12208.747s">Category,</a> bucket, account, whatever you want to call it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12230.175s">And-</a> And then those buckets don't get appropriate, those buckets don't get filled until the council makes the appropriation to spread the money out across them, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12237.799s">Do</a> we do that annually usually? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12239.694s">for</a> compliance purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12240.814s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12241.634s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12242.895s">So</a> there's $375,000 in there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12245.055s">Of</a> that $375,000, 2 thirds of it is dedicated to housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12252.797s">Or</a> is it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12260.099s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12260.519s">And</a> 2 thirds of that is, I'm sorry, 1 third of that is dedicated to this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12266.2s">this</a> program as of right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12282.818s">Pretty</a> sure 125 <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12285.278s">Is</a> a third of 375, but we're not going to get into a math dispute over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12291.361s">All</a> right, so ultimately, we have some money in the account still. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12295.723s">Six</a> and one half a dozen, the other one, me, Mr. President, I think the program's doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12298.864s">Like</a> Councilor Mark said, I'm not looking to hold a nickel back from this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12303.166s">or</a> this program, I think it's doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12304.727s">I</a> can support it tonight in its full funding, or I can support it tonight in half funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12309.669s">If</a> the intent is to maintain a close and watchful eye on the funds as the board of directors of this community, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12317.293s">I'll</a> support the resolution as amended that Councilor Marks put forward, if that's the direction that we want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12323.675s">Like</a> I said, Mr. President, they're going to come back before us again. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12326.097s">They're</a> going to put another report before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12328.138s">The</a> report's either going to show that they're making strides or they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12331.737s">at</a> which time we can reassess the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12334.139s">So</a> I see no harm in erring on the side of caution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12419.319s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12421.08s">Through</a> these Community Preservation Act funds, do we not fund a Community Preservation Act administrator to perform these administrative functions?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12431.52s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12432.301s">It's</a> a bird.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12637.852s">I</a> don't want to go off on a tangent, but so what I'm hearing is when the council takes a vote to appropriate funds, those funds don't get appropriated until all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12645.997s">Or</a> is this a situation where it's a monitoring of the grant agreement to ensure that there's compliance?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12656.335s">And</a> you can just say the first or the latter, the former or the latter. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12658.437s">I</a> mean, I'm not looking for a dissertation, but from the way I just heard it was that the council takes a vote, they vote to expend $125,000, then it goes into an office and the office only gives them 50 or 80 or 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12669.085s">That's</a> not what the council voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12670.606s">I'm</a> assuming that the reason why all the money's not released is because you wanted to monitor the grant for compliance, but that's not really what I heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12676.491s">So</a> I just wanted a confirmation on that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12855.453s">By</a> way of prior deliberation on a similar matter, we've always voted for each item individually for a CPA grant request. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12864.719s">If</a> you recall, there was an item before us where they wanted to fund a master plan for the DCR with no commitment for further construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12871.262s">So</a> we were going to put the upfront cost up to do the design and study for some sort of walking <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12878.046s">and</a> there was no commitment from the state thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12882.369s">So</a> we said, why are we putting our money up for a plan that we don't know if we're going to get funding for? <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12885.911s">So</a> we've approved a bunch of appropriations out of the CPA, but we didn't approve that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=12892.194s">So</a> we've always taken them up as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13253.44s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13254.682s">Last</a> week we received a correspondence from the administration relative to a complaint that was filed concerning the public bid for our zoning consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13263.832s">And</a> I took an opportunity to read that document and it said that it was a dynamic and ongoing process and that the administration was doing their best to stay ahead of it and to keep the parties informed as to what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13274.823s">in</a> terms of the nature of the complaint, so on and so forth, and the investigating authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13278.664s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I think it would make sense for this council to meet to be provided with an update from the administration relative to the nature of the complaint, as well as what steps are being taken to ensure that the council is protected, and what impact this may have on our ability to continue working with Mr. Bobrowski.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13301.666s">And-</a> I think that would be helpful, because we need to have the administration give us the update.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13308.563s">I</a> mean, I don't want to, I don't know who's working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13310.564s">We</a> have 27 lawyers from KP Law that represent us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13312.746s">They</a> might want to bring somebody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13314.107s">I</a> don't know who's going to be handling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13315.708s">My</a> preference would be the chief of staff and the city solicitor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13319.19s">However,</a> the administration is the one that's going to be running point on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13324.233s">So</a> I would hope that they provide us with the appropriate person that can answer the right questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13329.777s">Second</a> the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13370.664s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13371.965s">Last</a> week, we had a paper before us requesting appropriations from ride share revenues that the city has generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13379.873s">And</a> these ride share revenues are used to improve markings and signage in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13387.802s">If</a> you look at Winthrop Street at Memorial Park between the hat shell right by the community gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13393.207s">and</a> the field, you'll see that there's a crosswalk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13395.81s">And</a> there's been a number of years of discussion concerning the Winthrop Street-South Street intersection and the ability to cross Winthrop Street at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13405.94s">And</a> studies have shown that because of the sight lines and the gradient, that that's not a place where they can put a working crosswalk with a red light, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13415.048s">But</a> I don't think anything would preclude us from being able to put some flashing beacons that would say that there is a crosswalk ahead and for people to be aware of pedestrians crossing the street in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13425.955s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask for approval of the paper, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13432.879s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13433.3s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13434.1s">And</a> the associated cost of something like this, based upon the paper that was before us, is less than $3,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13437.982s">Councilor</a> Bears.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13692.44s">Councilor</a> Leif. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13693.48s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13694.601s">I'm</a> hoping the councilor wouldn't mind me amending this paper to add a tree stump to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13699.523s">And</a> this is a tree stump that is on Lawrence Road, located between Summit and Terrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13703.965s">It's</a> directly across from the old entrance to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital's emergency room, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13709.508s">And</a> this tree stump is enormous. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13712.209s">But</a> what's troubling is that the city has removed five sidewalk panels and not replaced them for a period of about four months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13720.614s">So</a> while the residents are waiting for the stump grinder or stump dumper or whatever you want to call them to get out there and get rid of the stump, the sidewalk has been torn up and the sidewalk has not been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13732.644s">So</a> that sidewalk, a stretch of about four sidewalk panels, Mr. President, which would be about. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13738.271s">I</a> think each sidewalk panel is three feet long. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13741.234s">So</a> we're looking at anywhere between 12 feet of sidewalk that's just asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13747.54s">Not</a> even asphalt, just dirt, all broken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13750.283s">So</a> with that being said, I'd just like to amend the paper to include that as a priority stump to be removed and sidewalk replaced.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13858.65s">I</a> just like to amend the paper, Mr. President, to add a couple of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13865.373s">Councilor</a> Caraviello is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13867.154s">That</a> traffic island that was recently installed has been damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13872.116s">And</a> if we take a ride further down, <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13873.9s">the</a> street, and we come to Placelet Road and High Street, we'll see that we have a number of reflector beacons that cross the train tracks and provide warning that the train tracks are there that are damaged, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13885.724s">So</a> the reflector beacons at the railroad crossing between Placelet Road and Harvard, as well as the reflector beacons at the railroad crossing at Prescott and Canal need to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13897.287s">And</a> I'd like to add this to that paper, provided my council colleague has no issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=13918.551s">High</a> street between place that in Harvard and canal between Prescott and the railroad crossing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14031.301s">I</a> just want to commend Councilor Bears on conducting a great meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14033.782s">I</a> was very impressed at the way he held the meeting, how he handled it. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14037.843s">But</a> I'm also more impressed with the fact that he actually had representatives from the DPW here present in the council chambers to address some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14045.225s">I've</a> always been a firm believer that if we're going to get things done, we have to get in the same room and roll up our sleeves. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14049.466s">And</a> I was very impressed that Councilor Bears took the steps to allow these individuals here in the community to come before the council subcommittee and address some of their concerns and help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/S_jvt8DRKHw&t=14058.008s">So</a> I'd like to thank him for that and move approval of the paper.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=354.395s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=356.217s">As</a> we're all aware, I think that it's safe to say the streets in the city of Medford are in some pretty bad condition, probably the worst we've seen in a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=363.741s">And</a> with that being said, we have to start somewhere, Mr. President, to determine how we're going to address the road surfaces in this community, the streets, the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=372.948s">And</a> in looking at certain areas in the community, I feel as though there are thoroughfares that are labeled emergency thoroughfares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=380.754s">I</a> think the meeting before this, they talked a lot about priority sidewalks and emergency roadways and connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=386.918s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we look at our emergency arteries as the main roadways here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=393.001s">The</a> stretch of Boston Avenue being one of those emergency arteries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=397.143s">And</a> looking at what it's going to cost and what we need to do to begin to get a roadway resurfacing plan in place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=403.366s">So</a> I bring this paper forward to start a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=406.768s">about</a> what it's going to take and what it's going to cost for us to start providing services in the form of local services, like sidewalks, streets, stumps, tree removal, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=417.315s">So</a> with that being said, I offer this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=418.896s">I</a> ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=822.224s">Motion</a> to adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=824.195s">the</a> provisions of general law chapter 64 and section three and impose a local excise tax on the sale or transfer of marijuana products for adult use to anyone other than a marijuana establishment at a rate of 3%, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=835.783s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1007.529s">I</a> did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1009.781s">I</a> do believe that this council during budget time requested that we'd have a quarterly meeting relative to where we were with forecasts and receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1018.523s">And</a> then the council did vote on a resolution asking that this meeting take place relative to the state of the city's finances for the second Tuesday in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1029.385s">That</a> never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1031.465s">And</a> here we are this evening with a request for appropriation before us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1035.727s">So,</a> you know, I know that these funds are through the surcharges around those Uber and Lyft rides that originate in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1042.377s">And</a> looking at the appendix that's attached, I certainly see no issue with the appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1048.605s">I'd</a> like to see them maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1050.256s">distributed</a> a little bit more equitably across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1054.379s">However,</a> I feel as though it's important, Mr. President, that we sit down and schedule a time for us to talk about the state of our finances here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1063.145s">During</a> the budget, we were talking about a fiscal crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1067.188s">We</a> took $5.5 million from our reserves and we appropriated that much money from our reserves to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1073.673s">The</a> question is, are we doing better now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1076.698s">Do</a> we have the ability to restore some of those funds back to our reserves if our forecasts are showing that our receipts are up well above anticipated returns? <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1085.635s">So</a> Mr. President, it was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1088.191s">discussion</a> that took place during the budget, and this was one of the items that came out of that, was that we'd meet quarterly to determine what the current and ongoing state of fiscal affairs is in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1098.358s">And</a> that needs to happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1100.44s">And</a> we have a paper before us asking us to appropriate $136,000, but we still haven't had that meeting to recap the last quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1108.425s">So</a> that's concerning to me, Mr. President, and I'm hoping that the finance director would be able to coordinate with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1115.87s">to</a> determine a time where we'll be able to do that before the next quarter is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1119.994s">So</a> with that being said, here we are almost one month into the next quarter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1125.098s">So</a> we're going to get a skewed perspective of what's going on if we don't meet as close to the close of the quarter as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1133.444s">So</a> I'd ask that that meeting be scheduled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1141.951s">I</a> did want it during the regular session, yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1146.636s">If</a> this was a free cash appropriation, I'd be much more concerned about taking a vote this evening on it, but where it's coming from a dedicated accountant that has a dedicated purpose, that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1158.383s">So</a> that being said, Mr. President, this will be the last money paper I vote on until we have that quarterly meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=1165.688s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3306.166s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3665.375s">Three,</a> four years ago, he started this mission where he began collecting World War II artifacts, World War II uniforms and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3675.859s">And</a> that morphed into this veteran's preservation project where Noah goes, <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3681.241s">all</a> across Massachusetts, all across New England, showing off his wares at various town hall meetings, veterans meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3689.529s">Along</a> with the artifacts that he has, he also has many stories that go along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3695.634s">And</a> it's just very impressive, Mr. President, that a kid at such a young age has shown such a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3701.9s">to</a> furthering the memory of veterans here in Massachusetts, in Medford, and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3708.866s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do think it might make sense for us to invite Noah down and honor him with a citation based upon the success of the Veterans Preservation Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozFya1z-SYk&t=3720.155s">And</a> I'd offer that in full of a motion.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_HIUEqVMOaUE/2024-11-19_HIUEqVMOaUE.html">City Council 10-13-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=680.729s">I'd</a> like you to appear before the council to talk to us about the projections and the revenue forecasts and where we are in terms of this time last year and what our financial picture looks like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=690.292s">This</a> was something we talked about where we requested that you appear before us quarterly back when the budget was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=695.593s">That</a> was a part of the budget papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=697.254s">When</a> we discussed and deliberated the budget, we requested that we get quarterly updates on the revenue projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=702.035s">The</a> first quarter has ended and it's time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=787.208s">Mr.</a> President, motion to waive the reading for a brief synopsis. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=790.589s">This</a> matter has been on the agenda now for three consecutive weeks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=795.388s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=804.871s">Certainly,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=805.831s">The</a> paper before us this evening- We can vote on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=812.693s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=829.988s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=830.768s">This</a> is a companion paper to the zoning amendment that the council just passed recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=834.609s">What</a> it is is it's a paper that would establish a selection committee for applicants for marijuana licenses in the city of Medford as required by state law and by the will of the voters here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=844.571s">This</a> document would allow by right <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=847.192s">marijuana</a> establishments to be located in commercial to or industrially zoned districts by way of a special permit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=854.8s">It</a> outlines a selection committee that's chaired by the chief of police and has five members which would rank and interview the applicants and make recommendations to the mayor who would have the power to enter into a host community agreement to issue a license to <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=869.194s">one</a> of the applicants, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=870.535s">So</a> this is a paper that has been before us for a number of years, about five years, half a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=874.958s">I'm</a> glad to see that it's finally come to the finish line, Mr. President, and I would move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=880.422s">There</a> was some discussion and some concern about the 3% local option tax that would be included in this paper, and at the advice of our city solicitor, Kimberly Scanlon, she has provided us with the legal opinion that we can do that by way of adopting a local option. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=894.213s">I'd</a> ask that that local option be placed on the agenda next week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=897.935s">so</a> that we can vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=898.956s">It</a> doesn't have to be done this evening according to what our legal counsel tells us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=902.637s">I'm</a> very glad that we asked Solicitor Scanlon this question because we were waiting for Kopelman and Page to give us an answer now for at least five weeks on it, and we didn't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=911.302s">So</a> I'd like to thank Solicitor Scanlon personally for the work that she's done in allowing us to bring this as far as we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=917.665s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, that's the brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and I'd move for approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=923.071s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=999.506s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1002.107s">I</a> am a self-identifying amazon.com addict. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1006.549s">I</a> have boxes delivered to my house constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1009.45s">And</a> as we go through the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic, I think we've all become far more reliant on delivery services like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1018.714s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, while Amazon does provide a great value and a great service to those of us in this community, the driving practices of their delivery drivers aren't exactly up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1031.028s">I</a> don't think Mr. Jotis or Mr. Bruno gave them a training course on how to drive here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1037.895s">A</a> lot of times what we'll see, Mr. President, is an Amazon truck that's making a delivery, drive down, say, a small side street like Billings Avenue in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1046.929s">And</a> they come up to the house and they say, this is a good spot to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1051.572s">right</a> in the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1052.893s">And</a> they park their car, and they get out, and they make a delivery, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1055.515s">It's</a> creating safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1056.416s">It's</a> creating quality of life issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1057.617s">It's</a> creating traffic issues in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1059.919s">I</a> know that amazon.com is a good neighbor, a good creator of jobs here in the community, with good paying jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1068.206s">And</a> we appreciate the work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1069.607s">And</a> I know that if we have the opportunity to speak with them, I think that they'll be willing to work with us in assuming a partnership that allows us to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1077.753s">So</a> with that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1079.995s">Move</a> the floor to my council colleague and co-sponsor of the resolution, Councilor Scott Peli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1361.591s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, it's becoming quite frequent that the parties' meetings start at 5.30 and end after midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1368.357s">And</a> that raises the question as to if a meeting is posted for Tuesday evening between 7 and 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1374.362s">and</a> it's going to be broadcast on Zoom and it goes <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1378.202s">past</a> the posted hours, and then further on into the next day, whether or not that would create the potential for an open meeting law violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1385.287s">I</a> know there are many concerned citizens in Medford that have raised some issues about open meeting law in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1390.791s">So</a> as we move forward and work towards full and total compliance with the open meeting law and do our best to do such, I ask the question to the city solicitor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1398.237s">So</a> I move for approval and ask my council colleagues in support to pay it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1465.128s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1466.668s">Park</a> Medford's opening at, I guess we'd call, modified hours at this point in time, 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1473.111s">to</a> 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1473.831s">daily,</a> and it creates a little bit of a hardship for individuals in this community that work, that might want to pick up the phone and call over there to ask some questions, to appeal a ticket over the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1483.214s">So</a> I'm asking that the administration take a look at the negotiation that they did with Park Medford and the contract that they have in place to allow them to modify their hours and see if we can have one night a week with their open late, maybe the same night, like Wednesday nights that coincides with city halls late. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1496.225s">But</a> just the night so that people know that they can take care of city business and all city offices are going to be open and available.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1656.592s">Mr.</a> President, I support this paper wholeheartedly, and I'd like to add a amendment or a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1661.733s">Just</a> several weeks ago, I believe we talked about accessibility, and there's one aspect of accessibility, which is design and construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1669.174s">And</a> there's another aspect of accessibility, which is government-created accessibility issues through permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1674.495s">And</a> I know a number of us behind this rail spoke about some concerns that they had with Snappy Patty's location in the sidewalk there, and we had requested an update from our <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1683.537s">ADA</a> compliance officer, the director of diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1685.559s">And</a> I don't believe that paper has been forthcoming, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=1687.881s">So</a> I'd like to, again, reiterate that request.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2377.387s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I have a couple of questions concerning the applications for vote by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2383.67s">It's</a> my understanding that this whole process was handled in-house, is that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2391.538s">Last</a> Tuesday night, when we were here at the meeting, I had to use the restroom and I went out and I heard the postage machine going. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2397.96s">And</a> I went in there and one of our representatives of our building department was running ballots through the postage machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2403.322s">And</a> that got me to thinking, why is it that we're mailing these <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2407.903s">with</a> a first class stamp on them, if we could send it to a mail house and do an enhanced carrier route line of travel, we'd probably be able to cut down the cost of the actual mailing for the applications to vote by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2418.171s">So</a> I didn't know if there was some sort of requirement that these had to be mailed by first class, or if we could have done an enhanced carrier route line of travel bulk mailing to deliver these ballots and save some money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2467.476s">And</a> do we know what the cost difference is? <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2469.277s">I</a> mean, it's $0.55 for a first class letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2472.059s">I</a> mean, I think you can get it down to $0.13 per piece.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2482.286s">And</a> then I know that you've done a great job, Adam, and I'm not being critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2486.809s">We</a> have had some fair share of problems with ballots going to the wrong district. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2492.812s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2503.932s">And</a> that's why I make the recommendation that it might be better that we handle this through a mail house, where the mail house can put together the mailing labels, where they're supposed to go, the district, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2513.254s">People</a> that do this for a living, that just have the expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2516.294s">So</a> we'd have less margin of error, and then we'd also have the cost savings capability. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2520.975s">If</a> it takes a couple more days, it takes a couple more days. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2522.855s">We'll</a> just have to start earlier, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2524.175s">But</a> that would be my suggestion and recommendation going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2527.556s">But</a> I would not offer that in the form of an amendment or a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=2530.557s">I</a> can bring that up at the registrar's meeting, the next registrar's meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3103.469s">Yes,</a> 70 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3106.229s">Mr.</a> President, motion to take papers 19342, 19526, and 19623, receive in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3114.251s">They're</a> all from last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3116.232s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3154.067s">The</a> ones that I wanted to, well, it's unfinished business. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3156.389s">We</a> have to take it from the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3157.269s">They're</a> not taped, are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3158.51s">Well,</a> I guess they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3160.351s">It's,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3162.092s">Why</a> don't we just take all the papers off the table?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3282.478s">The</a> motion is going to be received and placed on file.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3329.163s">I'd</a> be happy to take 2-0-4-2-1, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3330.304s">Okay,</a> 2-0-4-2-1 on the motion of Council Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3344.939s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this is a resolution I put forward at the June 23rd meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3348.221s">I</a> think we went past 12 o'clock that evening and we didn't get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3351.383s">It's</a> been tabled since that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3353.164s">This</a> was a request for our animal control officer to review our existing ordinances to provide us with any recommended updates or best practices that we could implement so that we could strengthen and improve the animal control ordinances that we have here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3364.911s">I'd</a> ask that my council colleagues approve the paper and ask that the paper be forwarded to the city solicitor once the animal control officer provides us with his recommendations for drafting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3372.697s">So</a> at this point in time, just to the animal control officer for him to review and report back.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3428.186s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3433.53s">Mr.</a> President, paper 20423.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3465.938s">Mr.</a> President, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3466.719s">Back</a> in June, the Belmont Chinese Society had reached out to me and asked if the city of Medford would be willing to accept a donation of 5,000 surgical masks at the beginning of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3479.807s">This</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3483.051s">Donation</a> was facilitated by representative Donato and back in June, we were able to present the police and fire department with these masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3490.539s">So</a> I just wanted to reach out and make the appropriate, appropriate gratitude to the Belmont Chinese society for their generosity and donation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3658.68s">Motion</a> to leave on the table, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3660.801s">Not</a> take off the table, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3661.901s">I'd</a> request to not take it off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3663.221s">They</a> haven't opened yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3745.478s">So-</a> We'll leave it on the table until the second review passes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HIUEqVMOaUE&t=3764.92s">Motion</a> to accept the minutes of the previous meeting, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_Ed1yh8j5gO4/2024-11-19_Ed1yh8j5gO4.html">City Council 10-06-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=479.751s">Mr.</a> President, motion to table the next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=481.892s">City</a> solicitor was requested to put some language together last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=484.993s">She's</a> not in receipt of that quite yet, so she needs another week to put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=489.415s">I'd</a> move for approval to a date certain next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=492.136s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3051.274s">Mr.</a> President, if I may?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3054.867s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to take an opportunity to thank Sue and her team from Melrose Wakefield Hospital, the Newton name that they're going by now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3063.43s">But</a> they've done a great job in responding to the council's inquiries, the council's concerns, and always being ready and available to come here to address this body when we have issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3072.874s">So</a> I do want to thank them and commend them for the work that they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3075.795s">And</a> I look forward to working through some of the design issues that we have and the construction issues that we're having in the neighborhood between now and our next meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=3982.136s">You</a> read the update, didn't you?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4097.627s">Do</a> these phase three, part two updates that you just gave us relative to capacity extend to the Medford City Council Chambers?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4118.379s">So</a> there's no limit on the capacity of people, it's just we're exempt from that, you said?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4131.243s">Okay,</a> so we could have more than 125 people in the council chambers provided that we could maintain safe space?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=4139.586s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6017.408s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6018.949s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6019.129s">O'Connor,</a> based upon the statements that you've made tonight, what is the position of the administration on sending our children back to school, number one, and what role has your office played in determining safe air quality standards in our public school buildings?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6091.111s">They're</a> well aware of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6092.312s">Are</a> you aware if the school department is using the recommendations of any medical professional in terms of their moving forward with the air quality examinations and the determination of safe standards?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6124.958s">And</a> what is the position of the administration relative to returning our students back to school?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6163.056s">In</a> your professional opinion, do you feel as though the school will be held in an in-person fashion at all this year, or do you think it will be hybrid and remote?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6186.997s">You</a> obviously don't have a child at home.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6196.945s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6197.205s">So</a> as of right now, we really don't know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6206.616s">And</a> Mr. President, I'd like to also offer a C paper because Councilor Caraviello beat me to the punch on the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6212.357s">But</a> this C paper would be an ordinance, Mr. President, an emergency ordinance that would say that any school department or city employee who is required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19 be placed on paid administrative leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6226.587s">as</a> opposed to having to use their sick time or their vacation time or their recruiting time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6231.989s">It's</a> an occupational exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6233.39s">It's</a> something that's happened because they're trying to perform the duties of their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6237.032s">And</a> if that case happens, I don't think it's fair that these individuals should be punished by having to use their sick or vacation time in order to quarantine during these periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6244.955s">So</a> I'd ask that that C paper be forwarded to the city solicitor for her to draft up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6275.06s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6276.421s">Any</a> school department or city employee required to quarantine due to occupational exposure to COVID-19? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6281.743s">Okay,</a> hang on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6362.073s">Seems</a> like it's a public policy initiative that's generally accepted by the administration, Mr. President, so I see no harm in memorializing that by way of an emergency ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6396.806s">Just</a> administrative leave doesn't have to be rather than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6398.866s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6405.512s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like that to go to the city solicit of a legal review and drafting, you know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=6441.115s">That</a> does it for me, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7668.461s">The</a> thing that's taking place- The information that the speaker is requesting is not under our scope and purview, so we don't have the ability to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7680.233s">The</a> information that the speaker is requesting is not under the scope and purview of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7684.556s">That</a> information is under the scope and purview of the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7687.958s">And</a> I know that the teachers union has a lot of concerns and a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7693.602s">And</a> maybe it would be more appropriate for the union to meet with the director of health in a side meeting on this, because I think- So Adam, I hear what you're saying.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7712.054s">Councilman,</a> are you all done? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.135s">That</a> was it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7713.955s">I</a> just thought we were kind of going off a little away from a council meeting and a little bit more into negotiation at that point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7737.264s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7738.784s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7741.265s">Actually,</a> Mr. President, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7743.086s">Motion</a> to report the questions out, receive the paper, and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=7745.727s">Still</a> second.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.367s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8122.928s">Mr.</a> President, can I ask the petitioner, the council that made the motion to explain the reasoning for the reason to sever?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8148.251s">I'm</a> looking at Chapter 48, Section 51 right now, and it looks to read the same to me under Amendment 1.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8165.296s">We</a> want to table the issue so the gentleman can take a look at the legislation, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8168.817s">The</a> current zoning ordinance?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8173.758s">Is</a> that necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8174.539s">I</a> mean, you made the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8176.563s">I'm</a> comfortable with the motion as is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8281.158s">It</a> looks to me, Mr. President, like actually- It looks to me like it actually takes away the mapping requirements as outlined in the establishment of the district under 4851A. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8289.165s">This</a> is only an amendment to- Bounded as respectively shown on the map entitled versus under the authority of 40C, the following districts bounded respectively in which are on file in the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8307.512s">and</a> made part of this article reference to hereby established. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8310.095s">It</a> takes away the mapped district.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8317.802s">It</a> takes out the word map entitled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8321.145s">I'd</a> be happy to re-insert them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8323.767s">So</a> you want to re-insert the same language that's in the existing ordinance to separate? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8328.132s">I</a> don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8330.354s">So</a> we're going to strike <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8332.338s">Amendment</a> 1 and replace it with the existing language in 48-51a. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8337.541s">Is</a> that the motion?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8346.966s">And</a> the map entitled the hillside historic Avenue district and the mom Simmons historic district.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8437.717s">It's</a> because I didn't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8438.838s">I</a> didn't understand why we needed the motion to sever the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8442.122s">However,</a> Mr. President, I'll rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8443.724s">I'll</a> just vote no.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8451.494s">I</a> don't think he's the city solicitor, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8765.346s">Can</a> I just ask them to repeat that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.368s">They</a> want what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=8767.829s">Over</a> the building?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9111.615s">Is</a> it the role of the Historic Commission or the Historic District Commission to establish historic districts?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9120.304s">So</a> why would Mr. Haywood be the expert on these questions?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9303.491s">Is</a> the gentleman a structural engineer?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9314.842s">And</a> the architects have the... <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9317.83s">professional</a> knowledge and expertise to determine whether or not a structure is salvageable based on the building code and the like?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9524.142s">So,</a> Mr. President, so- Counts on eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9527.903s">Mr.</a> Haywood was present at the walkthrough as the chairman of the Medford Historic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9534.605s">The</a> issue that was before us was whether or not October or something was going to come and go and a demolition permit was going to be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9542.844s">From</a> what I understand, based upon the history that we've all discussed ad nauseum at this point concerning this project, was that he applied for a demolition permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9555.029s">He</a> got his property deemed preferentially preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9560.13s">He</a> had his engineer come and say the place can't be salvaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9565.693s">Where</a> in the process does this design review come into play for the historic commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9572.671s">And</a> if the gentleman said, hey, look it, my engineers say the place can't be salvaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9579.436s">Why</a> did the historic commission wait 17 months to send this to historic district commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9585.76s">And</a> then Mr. Haywood from the historic commission is the one that made a representation that I believe if we look at the committee report that this shouldn't be deemed a historic district and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9600.176s">the</a> compromise would be satisfactory and that would be the direction that they would move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9605.522s">Now,</a> last night, they go before the historic district commission to have the plans looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9611.168s">I'm</a> totally confused by this process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9613.23s">It's</a> an absolute mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9614.691s">It's</a> an absolute mess, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9617.995s">So</a> I'm a little confused as to <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9622.591s">The</a> historic district commission doesn't have any design review authority until it becomes a historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9627.675s">And</a> by statute, the historic commission has no design review authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9632.678s">And</a> we discussed that at the committee of the whole and the chairman of the committee, the commission acknowledged that they don't have design review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9640.003s">They're</a> not enabled, those powers on the ordinance that they're operating under. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9645.748s">So</a> I'm very confused as to how this is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9648.451s">It</a> seems to me like it's somewhat being weaponized against the developer or against the builder because he didn't agree that the building could be saved and present plans for them to look at during a 17 month period where there's no real statutory authority for them to have design review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9733.908s">The</a> part that's confusing me is why is it before your board if it's not a historic district commission yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9739.091s">Why</a> is it at the Medford Historic District Commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9740.973s">Why</a> is he going to a meeting there presenting plans when it's not a historic district commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9745.115s">And</a> the negotiations took place between the historic commission, not the historic district commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9805.907s">Is</a> the administration going to offer that paper to the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9808.389s">Because</a> the paper that's before us is the paper that the mayor gave us on September 3rd.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9820.529s">Paper</a> 20541 is the paper before us offered by Mayor Lungo-Curran to the Medford City Council September 3rd, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.277s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9829.978s">33</a> days ago.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9956.626s">So</a> I'm confused by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9957.827s">So</a> the historic commission sent their paperwork to the historic district commission to establish a single home historic district at 16 Foster court and August 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9973.799s">The</a> historic district commission took a vote at that August 28th meeting that passed three to zero to move forward with the creation of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=9985.077s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10012.235s">Okay,</a> so then the mayor sends to us this language on September 3rd? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10016.938s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10022.142s">You</a> guys only passed it August 28th, that's pretty good if you ask me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10025.925s">You</a> guys passed it August 28th, the mayor sent it to us September 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10028.527s">I</a> don't think that's too bad, five days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10034.818s">Now,</a> the language that the mayor sent us is the language that you guys never looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10038.541s">Is</a> that what I'm understanding? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10039.982s">So</a> you voted for the principle, but you didn't vote for the language.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10083.505s">As</a> to what it is that you seek? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10084.946s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10086.581s">But</a> until this 16 foster court is deemed a local historic single home district, what authority does the Medford Historical District Commission have over it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10122.675s">In</a> theory, then, Mr. Goldschneider had no obligation whatsoever to appear before the Historic District Commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10133.984s">Where</a> he really should have been would be before the Medford Historic Commission, because that's where the rub lies, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10140.409s">I</a> mean, that's what it sounds to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10168.892s">So,</a> I mean, absent... So for 17 months, the applicant <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10178.371s">sat</a> saying, you know, my engineers say it's a total teardown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10182.575s">My</a> structural engineer says that, you know, there's nothing I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10185.918s">I</a> have to rip it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10186.899s">I</a> have to pull it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10188.14s">My</a> structural engineer, my expert, who I hired and has paid the money, told me that this is what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10193.905s">So</a> he has an expert opinion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10196.827s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10197.808s">So</a> at that point in time, when <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10201.673s">he</a> notified the historic commission of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10205.234s">Don't</a> you think it would have made sense that maybe then you moved it forward to the historic district commission instead of dragging it out for 17 months?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.699s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10226.939s">I</a> mean, I feel like it's being weaponized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10228.459s">Do</a> what we say or else we're going to cost you a ton of money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10265.286s">Sorry</a> to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10266.307s">Can</a> you just tell me what the terms of service are for all the members?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10271.748s">No,</a> in terms of how long they've served. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.508s">I'm</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10273.888s">I</a> know that your term is three years, but you've probably been on there for 12.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10279.509s">So</a> how many years have you served on the commission?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.655s">18.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10283.675s">All</a> right, how many years has the next most senior member served?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10296.162s">You're</a> 11?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10310.114s">because</a> that raises some concern, too, when the representative from the historic commission says, well, no one has been paying attention to this for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10318.777s">And</a> then we look at the terms of service of the members that are on the board, and we look at the council resolution from 2014, which asked that single home historic districts be sought after and be proactively identified prior to the request for a demolition permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10335.644s">And</a> that was something that...
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10345.775s">It</a> happened at the budget when you were there asking for money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10369.451s">So</a> we were given the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10370.972s">So</a> that was six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10372.292s">Can</a> you tell me how many single home historic districts you've identified in the past six years, absent the demolition permit or a request from the MCD?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10403.487s">So</a> in 6 years there's been one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10407.87s">Well,</a> this wasn't proactively identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10409.712s">This</a> was as a result of a demolition permit being pulled and then well, that was this was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10421.822s">By</a> what?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10436.757s">I</a> know it's hard to sell a building if nobody knows about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10439.319s">All</a> right, thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10452.746s">They</a> own it, aren't they allowed to?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10484.542s">I</a> think that's something we'd all appreciate, Mr. President, through you to Mr. Bader. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10490.287s">Mr.</a> President, I do have a last question, and I'll rest my case at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10493.91s">At</a> the council meeting when this issue was brought up and at the subsequent subcommittee meeting, I did ask a question to the city solicitor as to whether or not the criteria <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10507.081s">the</a> circumstances of this particular property could constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city of Medford to financial or other liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10516.394s">And</a> I'm wondering if you've received a response, or the city clerk maybe has received a response relative to that question of law that we asked the city solicitor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10554.764s">The</a> consensus by the four members of the Historical District Commission, the consensus of a land court judge, the consensus of whom?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10565.306s">You</a> said it was the consensus that this is not a regulatory taking.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10582.941s">So</a> the district commission conducted a three-prong test to determine whether or not it was a taking?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.408s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10606.868s">So</a> I think that opinion might be important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10608.969s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10711.984s">I</a> think I believe that the last meeting I asked for a copy of the letters that was sent to Mr. Goldschneider, inviting him to these 17 consecutive meetings that had him on the agenda that said we're asking you to come and present. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10723.189s">Because</a> the way that I see their agenda is that everything that they have going on, they just throw on the agenda and put it out every week and whatever comes up, comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10729.812s">So</a> although it might have been on the agenda for 17 months, I don't believe that the gentleman was invited to appear to any of these meetings over that period of time but for one or two.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10750.511s">Can</a> the gentleman please provide me with the information that he just received and what expert provided it to him? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10754.233s">A</a> multi-million dollar contract, a multi-million dollar project, a multi-million dollar property? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10758.116s">I</a> think that that's not what I said.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10938.463s">Could</a> the clerk provide a record of such communication? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10942.044s">Adopted</a> by the city council in the form of minutes and forwarded to the proper authorities, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10947.896s">Did</a> it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=10949.357s">That's</a> obviously not.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11579.619s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11581.56s">That</a> sounds an awful lot like deliberation to me, Mr. President, absent a public meeting notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11587.322s">And</a> I think that that's something that we better be very careful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11592.204s">Individual</a> members of a board of commission passing private notes to the chairman of the commission to be passed on to another board of commission that reflects their opinion, that's done behind closed doors, not in the open sunset of day, I think is a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11606.59s">And</a> I think that that might rise to <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11610.848s">the</a> level of violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11614.03s">And</a> as public employees, we need to be very careful in that regard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11634.08s">Did</a> anybody from the Historical Commission appear before the Historic District Commission and give an opinion as to what they felt?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11643.652s">Was</a> that opinion reflective of the board or the individual?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11660.578s">A</a> member, a chair, same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=11663.239s">There's</a> deliberation that's going on behind closed doors, Mr. President, that's a problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.261s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12685.441s">Mr.</a> President, with all due respect to the councilor, the gentleman's going to have to seek legal advice if he's willing to make that type of commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12691.365s">All</a> right, that's fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12725.801s">I</a> did, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12726.701s">Is</a> Mr. Moki available?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12728.882s">He's</a> not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12729.423s">Is</a> the city solicitor available?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12735.746s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12736.466s">So</a> I guess my question's to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12737.927s">Number</a> one, say that a rendering, say the rendering that we looked at tonight was suitable to both commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12747.972s">And</a> they said, move forward and do what you got to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12750.773s">The</a> gentleman would still be subject to site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12754.667s">through</a> our office of community development, which is an open notorious process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12758.829s">During</a> that site plan review process, because his parcel is an apartment two zone district, and there's a single family home there right now, or a two family home right there right now, it's being underutilized land use, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12770.715s">Number</a> two, because it's a site plan review project, he's gonna be responsible to pay linkage, Mr. President, on top of going through the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12776.838s">He's</a> also gonna have to pay linkage to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12778.818s">So</a> we're looking at a parcel that's being underutilized, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12781.2s">If</a> an apartment building gets built there, which is it's zoned use, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12785.211s">The</a> tax revenues are going to increase, we're going to be able to get linkage, and we still have two more processes in the review of the design that the city has the ability to take a bite at the apple on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12796.847s">I</a> think that the gentleman has, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12800.211s">taken</a> a lot of wax in terms of this whole entire process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12804.775s">And</a> he's maintained his cool a lot better than I would have been able to with the level of frustration that I think he's met. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12812.501s">But</a> ultimately, Mr. President, I don't think any of us behind this rail got in the business to hurt people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12817.025s">And</a> the gentleman's being hurt by the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12820.25s">The</a> gentleman's being hurt by the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12821.671s">And</a> regardless of whether or not the process is what it is, it's not a good process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12824.812s">It</a> needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.112s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12826.373s">We</a> took a bad vote when we changed the demolition delay from six months to 18 months, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12830.694s">I</a> think it was a bad vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.155s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12832.995s">I</a> also think it was a bad vote when we changed it to any building that was built in the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12836.917s">I</a> think it was a bad vote, Mr. President, because I feel like what we're doing is not really looking at historic preservation, but what we're looking at doing is a board that's trying to flex its muscles right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12846.921s">All</a> right, we see a board that's trying to increase its level of influence and power in the community because the corner office, we don't have the strongest leader right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12854.271s">So</a> I think, Mr. President, looking at this, you know what I mean, and the way that it's going, there's two more opportunities for design review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12860.239s">The</a> parcel's a strange shaped parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12862.823s">It's</a> going to have to go before the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12865.093s">It's</a> already been noted in the meetings and noted in the discussions, and based upon the plan that's been presented, it's been determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12872.38s">So</a> this is nothing more, I think, than a power play at this point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12875.323s">And</a> I certainly thank the Council if I'm moving it to a vote, and I'll be happy to vote against it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=12882.43s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13060.571s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13061.012s">Mr.</a> President, if I could just offer an amendment to that paper, a re-paper to that amendment, that the administration provide us with a list of whether or not these contracts are being negotiated by internal counsel or external counsel, and the amount of money that they've spent on external counsel, if they have to do such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.71s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13138.87s">And</a> that can be in the form of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.231s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=13140.992s">It</a> can be in the form of a B paper or an amendment based upon the preference of the sponsor or the person.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15069.651s">Mr.</a> President, the snow and ice account is the only account that we can run a deficit in here in the city of Medford and across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15076.472s">We</a> heard Marsha this morning, it feels like this morning, earlier in the evening when we were talking about the Lawrence Mural Hospital and she gave us a figure of 20% of the community residents are senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15088.155s">I</a> know, I just realized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15089.435s">I'm</a> maybe a little high, but close. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15092.618s">You</a> know, the city in the past has had a practice of removing the snow in our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15097.282s">We've</a> had a bombardier that's gone down the street and down the sidewalks and removed the snow in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15103.228s">Joseph's</a> all the way down into Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15104.949s">And</a> that's a practice that we've <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15107.111s">Had</a> in the past, and it's a practice that should continue, when we look at the Department of Conservation and Recreation and we see the roadways that are under their control, they have a bombardier that comes out and clears their sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15117.314s">The</a> Department of Conservation and Recreation, a state agency, Mr. President, goes out and does all of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15124.255s">I</a> see no reason why the city of Medford should take steps to hold their citizens to a higher standard than that of their DPW and the contractors that they're hiring to pave the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15136.619s">We</a> can either pass an ordinance that's going to require the citizens to perform the DPW's job, or we can focus on the delivery of services here in the community for the residents and the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15145.448s">And</a> the way that we do that is by investing in our DPW, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15149.272s">And</a> that's an area that we've historically not invested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15152.435s">We</a> say, buy this piece of equipment because you're not going to have the manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15155.378s">We're</a> getting to the point now, Mr. President, where we've got more pieces of equipment than we do people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15159.162s">All</a> right, so we're not going to be able to get anything done if we don't look at what's going on, reallocate funds, and refocus what our priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15166.129s">Because</a> our DPW is failing right now, and they're failing because of one reason, manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15171.533s">Manpower,</a> Mr. President, manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15174.356s">We</a> can have over 100 police officers, over 100 firefighters, but not even 50% of that is part of our DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15183.1s">That's</a> a problem, Mr. President, and I don't think that penalizing residents and homeowners because we're making poor decisions in terms of how we allocate funds is going to be the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15191.987s">So</a> moving forward, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we look at the reasoning behind why fines for commercial properties have doubled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15199.413s">When</a> we look at commercial properties, they pay a higher tax rate than residential properties here in the community, as do industrial properties, because we have a bifurcated tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15207.621s">And</a> we have that tax rate for a reason, to keep residential property taxes low. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15212.065s">But</a> at the same time, snow removal, snow removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15214.347s">Why</a> are we punishing a commercial property owner double what we'd be punishing a industrial property owner or a residential property owner? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15222.654s">I</a> don't understand what the importance of singling out a commercial property for double fines is, when the commercial properties are the ones that actually bring jobs to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15234.281s">They</a> actually allow people to go to work, who live in Medford, can work in Medford, can play in Medford, can spend their ancillary money in the circular floor of our local economy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15243.867s">So</a> I think it's very important we recognize the role that commercial properties play in our community, and we shouldn't be singling them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15250.331s">Every</a> time we talk about zoning, we talk about the fact that we're losing commercial properties left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15255.032s">We're</a> down to 7 or 8% of the total number of parcels in our community is going to be commercial industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15261.094s">Well,</a> if we keep doing stuff like this and penalizing properties for being commercial when instances arise, then we're going to be in a situation where we're going to see less and less of that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15269.976s">So</a> I think that the fine should be uniform and across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15272.517s">It</a> shouldn't matter what type of parcel you own. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15276.67s">The</a> fines should be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15278.251s">That</a> coupled with the fact that I really feel as though we should be investing our efforts and our energies in delivering services as a city and as a community, in addressing some of the issues that Councilor Marks brought up about prioritizing our sidewalks and our roadways and ensuring connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15294.386s">But</a> at the same time, not doing it in a punitive fashion so that our residents are being penalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15300.63s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do think this needs a lot of work, and the paper remains in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15306.093s">So</a> we could take a vote on this, or we could just say call the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15310.956s">I</a> mean, the paper's in the subcommittee already from last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15313.237s">It</a> is what it is, but I'd move for approval on the paper and the amendments, and I'd like to ask that they be consolidated so that we can vote once.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15329.387s">I</a> don't know if there's one in public works or public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15332.288s">It</a> was in public works.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15336.229s">If</a> this is really a priority, Mr. President, last week we asked the city clerk to post three meetings, second Tuesday in October, November, and December, for the purpose of the city solicitor appearing before us to talk about ordinances in the ordinance subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15349.364s">This</a> is an ordinance, this is also a venue that we could take it up in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15352.067s">I</a> know Councilor Beals wants to maintain control of it, so he probably wants it in the committee that he chairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15355.851s">I</a> don't want to speak for him, but you know what I mean, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15358.594s">So</a> either way is fine with me, Mr. President, but those meetings are already going to be posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15362.939s">The</a> clerk's already been directed to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15364.601s">So</a> if we want to talk about existing ordinances, then that's a committee that can be referred to as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15377.142s">I</a> don't have a horse in the game, Mr. President, one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15379.985s">It's</a> going to have to go to a committee of the whole before it comes to the council floor, pursuant to council rules anyway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15506.372s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, just before we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15508.954s">I'm</a> sorry, point of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15510.756s">It's</a> 20 past 11 at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15512.417s">We</a> have about 17, 18 other items left on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15515.56s">This</a> matter is going to subcommittee to be vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15517.462s">It's</a> going to go to committee of the whole to be vetted further, and then it's going to come back to the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15522.026s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15523.51s">We're</a> all going to vote in favor to send this thing to the subcommittee to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15527.553s">We've</a> already all spoke on it, and we've already all said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15530.995s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, there'll be ample opportunity for individuals to provide public participation on the topic that's before us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15538.1s">They're</a> going to have a subcommittee meeting or multiple subcommittee meetings, a committee of the whole meeting, and then it's going to come back to the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15544.224s">Right</a> now, the vote we're taking is only to send it to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15546.665s">I</a> know there are individuals in the community that support this piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15550.988s">But</a> I think in the interest of time, Mr. President, it might make sense for us to say, OK, we're going to send it to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15555.469s">The</a> subcommittee is going to be scheduled, and the matter is going to be deliberated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15560.27s">And</a> then it's going to go to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15561.771s">It's</a> going to be scheduled, deliberated again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15563.291s">Then</a> it's going to be put on the council agenda, and going to move forward again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15566.272s">So</a> everybody's going to have an ample opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=15568.532s">We</a> would have been done by now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16010.345s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16012.866s">In</a> review of the common practice of the council, it's always been that the special permit for extended hours would be granted to the business and not the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16024.512s">And</a> the business is changing hands, which would require an application for a second <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16032.02s">An</a> application for a permit for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16035.301s">So</a> I guess, can the city clerk clarify or confirm whether or not when this initial permit was issued, it was issued to the property or to the business? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16043.682s">And</a> if it was issued to the business, then I believe they'd be required to come back before us for extended hours permit for any operation before 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16050.784s">or</a> after 11 p.m., right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16061.391s">And</a> I don't want to hold it up, Mr. President, so I have no problem moving for approval, provided that the clerk gives us the information that we're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16071.818s">And</a> if an extended hours permit is necessary, he contacts the business owner prior to their opening and informs them of the process that they need to go through to obtain an extended hours permit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16106.952s">It's</a> an operation of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16108.093s">I</a> mean, if the permit was issued, what they're asking for right now, they can't get if they're not grandfathered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16114.695s">If</a> they are grandfathered in, they can get it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16120.938s">Yeah,</a> let's confirm what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16123.039s">We'll</a> move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16124.32s">The</a> license is going to be, I'm under the impression it's going to be 7 to 11, unless otherwise with the restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16130.622s">And</a> if not, then the clerk will notify them and have them come back before us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16168.93s">Along</a> with the review, Mr. President, I'd like to ask that the permit go with the business entity and not the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=16174.652s">If</a> in fact we need to address the extended hours permit going forward, whether or not there's a way that we can put a mechanism in place so that it now goes with the business and doesn't stay with the process, whether that requires a rescinding of a vote, previous vote or not, but to protect the neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17045.819s">I</a> am all set, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17050.18s">So</a> does this mean they're not going to change the direction of South Street like they were talking about three years ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17054.362s">We're</a> going to get the speed bumps instead? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17056.142s">One</a> phone call, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17057.302s">Great</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17060.663s">No,</a> Mr. President, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17062.904s">I</a> think it's important also that because this is an issue of funding coming from partners in state government that we make sure that Representative Donato's informed every step of the way on what efforts we're making as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17075.194s">This</a> money didn't get released or given to us because we're good people and we're a nice community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17080.558s">They</a> got released because we were sending them letters once every two months asking them to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17085.142s">We</a> were bringing our chief of police down there and we were telling them do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17087.764s">We</a> were looking at statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17090.005s">So</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that in order to keep the momentum going, that we have our partners in government at the state level involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17097.007s">And</a> Representative Donato's been a champion on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17101.289s">He's</a> been very outspoken in his support for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17103.149s">So</a> I just ask that any time a correspondence goes out relative to the furtherance of this initiative that Representative Donato's offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17121.618s">He's</a> in a very powerful position, Mr. President, so I think that it's important that he be involved in these conversations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17128.299s">As</a> the assistant majority leader, he's going to have the ability to control some purse strings and get us some money, and he's done a great job of that in the past, and I'm sure he'll continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=17135.801s">So</a> I'd ask that he be involved.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18137.504s">Again,</a> Mr. President, the way that things have gone down with the Historical Commission in the past, oh, eight, nine months would lead me to believe that I don't want them to do anything other than what they were doing before what they were doing the last eight or nine months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18149.967s">So</a> with that being said, I'm opposed to Councilor Caraviello's measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18153.947s">I</a> feel as though the Historical Commission is exceeding their authority underneath the statute and the efforts and endeavors that they've undertaken in recent months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18161.229s">And</a> for that reason, I will be opposing this this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18238.344s">One</a> more information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18253.855s">It's</a> problematic, Mr. President, when everybody that you talk to says they're having some sort of problem getting a permit, some sort of problem getting a permit, unless they know somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18262.301s">They</a> call a city councilor and then they get, oh yeah, it's no problem, I'll get you in a half an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18265.764s">If</a> they don't know somebody, though, they're held up for 17 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18269.369s">All</a> right, that's a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18271.25s">I</a> feel as though that's a very big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18273.31s">I</a> also think it's a problem that, you know, there's no guidance from the administration as to how this process is supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18279.933s">So</a> now Paul Moky's supposed to notify someone or the building commissioner, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18285.475s">The</a> building department's supposed to notify residents which have had their buildings permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18289.096s">permits</a> reviewed by the historical commission within 72 hours after the review has been completed of the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18295.259s">Nothing</a> prompts the historical commission to notify the building commissioner within a defined period of time when they get the application or after they make their decision to tell the building commissioner when it is that they can pull the trigger on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18307.284s">This</a> is a flawed process from the start. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18308.945s">The</a> changes that have been implemented over the last year, Mr. President, are detrimental to the growth in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18378.952s">I</a> mean, if your application is before a board or a commission and they vote on it, the board of commission should be the one telling you what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18384.256s">You</a> know what I mean?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18405.247s">There</a> needs to be, someone needs to define who's responsible for issuing a building permit in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18410.928s">I</a> think that's the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18412.368s">It</a> always has been in the past, just like he's always been the person responsible for zoning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18417.369s">So</a> I think that although the council feels as though I'm comparing apples to oranges, I don't think that's necessarily the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18425.331s">I</a> feel as though I'm comparing overstep and overstep based upon the statutory guidelines and the ordinance that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18431.826s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18478.149s">Mr.</a> President, but again, the mechanism is when is the building department getting notified when the determination is being made? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18485.212s">And</a> is there a criteria or a timeline for when that determination needs to be made from the ancillary secondary body? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18491.57s">So</a> can I get a building permit and go give it to Paul Moki and he says, OK, yeah, this has to go to Historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18497.113s">He</a> gives it to Historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18498.373s">Historic</a> has a meeting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18499.734s">Neva</a> tells him about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18500.795s">Or</a> Historic doesn't have a meeting on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18502.115s">It</a> has a meeting on it in 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18503.916s">Are</a> there any defined parameters or timelines? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18507.338s">That's</a> the concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18509.339s">There's</a> a breakdown.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18526.845s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, I think it's been made clear by the council is that as long as you know a Councilor and pick up the phone, there is no breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18531.686s">But</a> if you don't know a Councilor and you can't pick up the phone, then there is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18610.324s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18611.365s">It's</a> a move point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18612.566s">We</a> took the vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18735.355s">Is</a> there a committee report?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18740.457s">Is</a> there one?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18744.679s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18814.975s">Motion</a> to take papers in the hands of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=18816.816s">No,</a> we have two more.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed1yh8j5gO4&t=19237.847s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_dQwFkF1-J44/2024-11-19_dQwFkF1-J44.html">City Council 09-22-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=424.93s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=426.05s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=428.331s">This</a> is a very important paper to the membership of American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=432.233s">And</a> in full disclosure, I've been a Sal in the past, a son of the American Legion member there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=437.374s">And</a> what this paper does is it allows them to operate underneath the governor's guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=441.836s">The</a> post has been shut down now since about St. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=444.637s">Patrick's</a> Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=445.657s">And</a> they haven't had the ability to generate any income whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=448.838s">And</a> that coupled with the fact that this veteran's organization does provide great support services for young and old veterans here in the community of Medford and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=457.004s">That</a> coupled with the fact that the American Legion Post 45 and its membership are always the first ones to step up when the city of Medford needs something, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=465.509s">If</a> you look to election day on September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=468.991s">When</a> the Lawrence Memorial Hospital was unable to host us for our election proceedings, the first people to step up to the plate were Richard Mott and Bobby Miller in American Legion Post 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=478.814s">And</a> when we celebrate our Memorial Day ceremonies, Mr. President, and we all go down to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=486.016s">Oak</a> Grove Cemetery and we sit there and we listen to the beautiful presentations put on by our veterans organizations and as we sit there we see those flags all across the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=495.973s">American</a> Legion Post 45 is the group that coordinates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=499.994s">The</a> placing of those flags on our veterans' grave markers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=502.616s">So</a> it's very important, Mr. President, that we recognize the work and the partnership that the American Legion has provided the citizens and the residents in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=509.821s">And</a> I think it's very important for us to adopt and embrace this opportunity for them to get a common victuals license so that they have the opportunity to reopen and generate some revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=518.887s">And</a> also allow the membership, the opportunity to come back in and to continue their mutual support relationship that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=526.011s">When</a> we look at the agenda later on this evening, we have a paper talking about substance abuse and addiction recovery services and the ability to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=534.154s">And</a> veterans organizations, although they don't necessarily hold meetings per se, are a great spot for veterans to congregate, to get together, and to talk about their shared mutual experiences and how to go through some of the struggles that they're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=545.438s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this is a paper that I support wholeheartedly, and I'd ask my council colleagues to also join me in supporting it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=778.813s">Okay,</a> why don't we try that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=965.97s">Mr.</a> President, at the end of our packet, there's a letter by Mr. Paris, and I think it's a very good explanation of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=973.2s">Dear</a> members of the city council, regarding our sign request for Liv's Juice and a Kai bar located at 56 Stations Landing, my understanding is that we're allowed two feet of projection. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=982.512s">Since</a> our 24 inch sign is circular, the total square foot is just 3.16 square feet, as opposed to the total four square foot sign that's allowed by the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=991.155s">The</a> mounting of the sign is flush to the building and would look very funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=993.776s">And</a> as a result, we're asking for four additional inches of projection for the standoffs to make it fit within the neighborhood and uphold the great look there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1001.358s">Mr.</a> President, I personally find a circular sign more aesthetically pleasing than a big square or rectangular sign sticking off the side of a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1007.541s">I</a> think Mr. Paris has given us a great explanation, and although it doesn't present a significant hardship, it certainly does present some curb appeal issues that this council has discussed in the past, and I support this paper wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1148.67s">I</a> know our ordinance speaks to the signs not being illuminated after 10 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1152.833s">Anyhow,</a> what are the hours of the gentleman's operations?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1196.908s">But</a> whatever the practices at stations landing, I mean, I'm not opposed to the measure at all, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1267.862s">I</a> thank Councilor Marks for raising the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1437.066s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, again, at the end of this application, there's also a letter dated March 3rd, 2020 from Mr. DeSilva at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1443.868s">I</a> guess March 3rd is when he requested his appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1447.188s">And</a> it reads, the purpose of these proposed awnings is to provide protection from the environment, enhance the appeal of the car wash, and instruct customers of free vacuum services in an attractive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1457.031s">Despite</a> the weather conditions, customers will be comfortable vacuuming their vehicles under the shade and shelter of the awning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1462.032s">And</a> the awnings are not only to benefit the customer's comfort, but also create a more attractive facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1466.294s">Finally,</a> the awnings instruct the customers where the free vacuums are located and create a clear space to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1472.516s">So</a> Mr. President, it seems like they're seeking 13 awnings, one over each vacuum that look like to be canvas awnings that aren't internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1484.3s">But</a> I do believe that they would have certain public safety benefit instructing <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1492.033s">where</a> the free vacuums are in a location like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1494.814s">I</a> believe this is the old Randy's Car Wash on Middlesex Ave, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1499.216s">They've</a> always done a pretty good job over there at Randy's, and I don't think that the new operator would be any less successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1506.879s">And</a> I can certainly support a reversal on the sign denial, but is 13 really the number that we want to approve, I guess is the question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1703.756s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1704.516s">I</a> would second that motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=1707.839s">For</a> it's often in the form of a I guess it would be a restriction correct counsel, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2260.718s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2263.259s">It</a> says that these signs would be internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2265.5s">Does</a> any of these internally illuminated signs face a residential structure?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2275.444s">Right,</a> because you got the old margaritas on one side, the other hotel, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2281.467s">So</a> they're not facing any of the, because they're pretty big, 150 foot square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.089s">All</a> right, sounds good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2286.949s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2458.434s">Mr.</a> President, in the past, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2467.039s">In</a> the past, Mr. President, when a circumstance like this has arose, what we've done is put a 30, 60, or 90 day review on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2474.444s">I</a> don't know if that's something we wanna do in this situation or circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2478.206s">I</a> haven't gotten any complaints <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2481.328s">from</a> anybody regarding the sign at 75 stations landing to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2486.051s">So</a> I don't find it to be a big issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2488.432s">However,</a> if it does become an issue because of the action of this council, I think that we should absolutely have the ability to give it a review to make sure that we're not disrupting anybody's quality of life that resides in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2499.298s">Well,</a> at the same time, still supporting the application of the Fairfield Marriott Hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2504.703s">We</a> all understand the benefits that having an additional hotel in our community is going to bring to us financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2509.348s">And</a> historically, they've been a good partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2512.03s">Our</a> other two hotels have been great partners here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2515.234s">So</a> I don't want to, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2520.163s">I</a> don't want to claim nefarious intent, but at the same time, I think it's important that we protect the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2524.505s">So</a> I would offer a 30 and 60 day review on the paper and move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2529.688s">For</a> the sign only facing 75 stations only.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2538.372s">I'm</a> sorry, I don't know if 75 is the address, but the north facing sign abutting the residential property.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.035s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2570.355s">I</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2825.465s">So</a> Mr. President, just to be clear, this application before us is just for the permit to reverse the sign denial. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2832.808s">And</a> any type of relief sought by the applicant relative to hours of operation outside of the ordinance and its 7 AM to 10 PM requirements would have to be sought under a different cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=2844.131s">That's</a> not going to be covered under the aspect of the vote that we're taking this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3304.425s">Mr.</a> President, through you, I was wondering if the petitioner could tell me on what side of the retaining wall on Broadway is this trench going to be dug? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3312.549s">Is</a> it going to be on the northern side of the retaining wall or on the southern side? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3316.731s">If</a> you're familiar with the area and you're driving up from Winter Hill and Somerville along Broadway, you'll come to the intersection of Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3326.036s">There</a> at that intersection, by way of history, is Paul Revere Park, which is the smallest park in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3332.08s">But</a> I digress, Mr. President, as you go past Paul Revere Park, Broadway splits in two, and you can go up Broadway and travel along the Medford border. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3341.005s">Some</a> of that is Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3342.706s">Or</a> you can stay on Broadway proper and go straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3346.687s">So</a> I was wondering exactly where this trench was going to be dug, because there is a Broadway in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3352.029s">And</a> it's the roadway that runs parallel to Broadway in Somerville, right where that split is, where it goes up and over the ridge and comes back down and brings you out where the old Salvation Army used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3364.413s">right</a> at Winter Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3365.313s">So</a> I was wondering if the applicant could tell us where the trench is actually going to be dug. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3369.015s">Is</a> it going to be dug on Broadway proper or is it going to be dug on that one-way access road?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3397.361s">So</a> do we know which side of that retaining wall it's going to be on, I guess, is the question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3407.946s">Nor</a> do I. So if you're looking at Medford Street at the intersection, you see that little park?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.39s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3416.67s">If</a> you go past the little park, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3419.462s">There's</a> a line with a little square. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3422.764s">And</a> that line with a little square, I think that's a street that comes right through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3429.168s">So</a> I just don't know what side of the wall that proposed gas main is going to be on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3434.531s">Is</a> it going to be on Broadway proper, or is it going to be on the access road?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3443.776s">I</a> would much rather prefer it to be on Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3448.114s">I'm</a> not in Medford, personally.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3471.44s">My</a> colleagues are following me with what I'm talking about, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3473.4s">You</a> guys know what I'm saying?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3483.527s">Dexter</a> Street is Big Bundle.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3524.707s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3526.868s">That's</a> Main Street, the little park, not Medford Street.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3534.032s">Main</a> Street and Medford Street split. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3535.894s">Main</a> Street goes further to the, I guess it would be east, and Medford Street goes up past those parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3543.418s">So</a> I was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3544.178s">I</a> had, because Dexter Street threw me off, because Dexter's <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3547.639s">Dexter</a> runs through Maine to Medford, so this is further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3552.103s">Creative</a> Science is on the corner here of Dexter and- You are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3557.188s">So</a> this will be going, there is no retaining wall, so this is all going in front of- Trump Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3561.992s">The</a> pizza place, Dacos Tavern, the Chinese food restaurant coming around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3566.716s">Okay,</a> yep, I second the motion to approve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3610.125s">This</a> is a service call. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3611.628s">I</a> know that there's some discussion in here about an SOP. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3614.413s">So</a> SOP means that the applicant <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3618.973s">would</a> provide the city with the funds to then go and perform, no, that's a street opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3624.797s">That's</a> a different program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3625.797s">I</a> guess the question is, is the 60 feet of roadway that's being torn up in Medford going to be replaced curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3632.161s">Where</a> this is creation of new service, we're tearing up a couple of roadways 60 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3636.864s">Are</a> we going to be able to get curb to curb restoration?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3691.704s">Yes,</a> I see it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3692.445s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=3694.066s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4616.403s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4618.043s">From</a> my brief calculations, it looks like this application seeks for about a half a mile of a ground opening permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4627.385s">Does</a> that sound correct, sir?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4632.47s">That</a> sounds about right, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4634.452s">2600</a> feet or something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.094s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4636.795s">And</a> it goes right through our central business district, Mr. President, one that we've been talking about for as long as I can remember in terms of what we're going to do to revitalize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4647.225s">The</a> lack of commitment to revitalize Medford Square coupled with <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4651.994s">the</a> impacts of the Kranich Bridge closure for such an extended period of time, along with the COVID-19 situation that's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4664.725s">We</a> have a number of restaurants and places that provide food services along this stretch, and the impact that they've <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4675.561s">The</a> financial impact that they've had to put up with through a variety of different reasons over the course of the last five years is troublesome, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4684.204s">So</a> I guess this is a long way of asking a question, and the question is, how long will this construction take?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4714.151s">Okay,</a> so you think you guys can do 100 feet a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4718.294s">More</a> than 100 feet a day?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.016s">Easily.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4721.396s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4722.156s">What</a> are the plans in terms of the storage of equipment and materials during the construction period?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4750.079s">Is</a> everybody at home getting this in case they have a problem during the construction?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4782.354s">Will</a> the public way be used for the overnight storage of equipment and materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4787.755s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4788.775s">Can</a> we put that as a condition?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4795.597s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4796.517s">So</a> I'd like to offer that in the form of an amendment number 18, Mr. President, as a condition that there'll be no storage of any equipment or materials on the public way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4802.939s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4804.04s">With</a> that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=4805.18s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5426.459s">Mr.</a> President, I personally couldn't agree with Councilor Bears more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5428.842s">I'm</a> very glad to see the property owner and the historic commission sitting down trying to make compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5434.449s">We</a> have ample opportunity and time to still address this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5439.416s">We</a> have another meeting before the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5442.598s">I'd</a> ask that the matter be tabled to a date certain to allow the homeowner and the historical commission to continue their deliberations and discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5449.343s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we do have, I believe, representatives here from the owner that have been working on a plan or are ready to make some commitments to a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5459.59s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that the property owner be given an opportunity to speak.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5754.423s">I</a> got a question if you're ready to give it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=5756.084s">I</a> have no problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6190.453s">I'm</a> sorry, provided it passes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6195.435s">But</a> if, okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6268.208s">Is</a> the city solicitor available as requested by the president from the meeting yesterday?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6282.394s">I'm</a> just looking at the committee report from last night where President Falco said that the council needs the city solicitor present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6288.797s">And</a> then the next sentence says Mr. Howard suggested holding off on a historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6292.987s">So</a> that's what I'm referring to is the conversation we had last night.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6309.597s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6310.518s">But</a> with all due respect, Mr. President, I had a conversation with the solicitor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6314.64s">And</a> from what the solicitor told me in my conversation with her was that <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6319.673s">The</a> issuance of the demolition permit is told when the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6328.256s">So</a> it doesn't matter if 18 months pass after the paper is advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6332.898s">And</a> there's case law on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6334.578s">And</a> she and I spoke about it at length today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6337.099s">I</a> did too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6338.52s">So</a> I'm not sure if the information that you're getting from her and the information that I'm getting from her are the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6344.122s">But</a> I'm pretty confident in the conversation that I had with her where she said, you're absolutely right, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6348.423s">I</a> don't know why this is so hard to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6351.348s">First</a> reading happens, then it gets advertised, and then advertisement controls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6355.175s">If</a> advertisement goes out, the demolition permit can't get issued, regardless of whether or not October 8th comes and goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6362.603s">So</a> second reading is the advertisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6366.705s">And</a> that is what tolls the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6369.307s">And</a> we can toll the demolition delay on October 7th if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6372.728s">So</a> I don't understand the need to take this to a vote right now when you yourself had suggested that the city solicitor needs to be present in order for us to make this vote properly, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6381.373s">And</a> number two, when the representative of the historic commission who was with us at the meeting suggested we hold off on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6400.811s">The</a> Herald runs every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6402.192s">The</a> Globe costs $1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6403.973s">Pay</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6405.174s">The</a> House is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6406.074s">Why</a> don't we want to spend the money to advertise for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6408.595s">I</a> mean, more people read the Globe than the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6410.276s">I</a> can't tell you a person that ever bought the Medford transcript in the last 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6413.018s">I</a> don't know one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.118s">I</a> buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6414.639s">I</a> get it every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6416.159s">God</a> bless you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6417.906s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6452.129s">Between</a> 7 o'clock last night and this morning?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6576.648s">I'm</a> glad Ryan gave you approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6675.261s">Mr.</a> President, before we table the matter, there is a committee of the whole report that's before us that's going to have to get put into the agenda for next week's meeting for us to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6684.628s">But</a> last night at the site visit, we did vote on a motion to ask a question of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6692.316s">And</a> that question that we asked to the city solicitor was, can this process constitute a regulatory taking, opening up the city to financial or other liabilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6701.062s">And</a> I'd like to offer that question to the city solicitor as a B paper this evening, so that we can get that to her for an answer as well before next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6728.158s">Opening</a> the city up to financial or other liabilities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6804.671s">October</a> 6th, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6810.552s">Sounds</a> right to me, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6845.749s">Motion</a> to revert back to regular order of business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6878.642s">Should</a> I be asked to withdraw my motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6880.202s">I'd</a> be happy to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6881.603s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=6885.883s">Certainly.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7087.71s">Mr.</a> President, if the legislation doesn't pass by the close of the end of the legislative session, then the bill needs to be reintroduced for the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7095.636s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7097.377s">The</a> question would come as to whether or not we need to pass another home rule petition to reintroduce the bill in the next legislative session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7102.902s">And</a> that I can't answer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7116.317s">Is</a> that a question you'd like to ask the solicitor?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7138.832s">I,</a> for one, will not be supporting this paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7141.333s">We're</a> in the middle of a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7143.153s">We</a> had a meeting for two hours today talking about how we're unable to conduct regular city council business right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7149.635s">One</a> out of five adults in Massachusetts are unemployed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7152.196s">We</a> have a 20% unemployment rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7153.816s">We're</a> seeing the worst economic time since the Great Depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7158.137s">People</a> are restricted in their ability to get about the community, to speak with people, to talk to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7162.098s">It's</a> going to impact the ability to run a grassroots campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7164.819s">and</a> inform the residents in this community what's going on, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7168.281s">Number</a> two, in times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7172.663s">In</a> times of uncertainty, we need stability. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7174.524s">We</a> should be focusing on getting our kids back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7176.425s">We</a> should be focusing on getting our economy locally back up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7179.346s">I</a> think that's what our priority should be right now during this global pandemic, things that actually make the community and the city run, the services that we deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7186.73s">You</a> know, I've stated and I've been opposed to this process in the past, doing it with the homework petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7190.792s">I</a> feel as though this is something that should come from the voters, that should come from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7194.113s">And</a> now is not the time to promote a ground up effort when the activities of people are so hamstrung. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7200.559s">And</a> where our government is operating under such stringent restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7204.783s">So</a> for those reasons, I'll be voting against the paper this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=7207.405s">I</a> rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8148.165s">I</a> do think it's also important to point out, for those that are so supportive of the measure, that if it goes forward tonight, you get two bites at the apple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8156.531s">because</a> if it doesn't pass by January, then it gets refiled again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8159.654s">And</a> if it does get passed before January, then you get charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8163.516s">But</a> I don't support the paper, but from an operational standpoint, if it got held until the end of the year or <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8171.983s">or</a> tabled or whatever it may be, and it can't come back up for 90 days, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8176.047s">The</a> next session's in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8177.349s">So</a> you can send the paper to legislation now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8179.411s">If</a> it doesn't get taken up for a vote, it doesn't get taken up for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8181.713s">Then</a> you want to do it again in January anyway when the circumstances change, you get another bite at the apple with a new legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8187.599s">So</a> that's something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=8188.76s">But</a> either way, I'm not going to support it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9208.967s">Mr.</a> President, I'm glad that we're finally getting to the finish line on this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9213.05s">It's</a> been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9214.35s">I</a> can remember filing the initial resolution asking Mayor Burke's staff to craft an ordinance some three and a half years ago, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9222.495s">And</a> in looking at the final product that we have here before us, I think it looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9226.037s">I</a> do have concern, and one of the concerns, the only concern I have about it is the enforceability of the seven barrels and the ambiguity of the seven barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9239.448s">In</a> the Seawind District, breweries operating with seven barrels or under would be allowed by right, and breweries operating with more than seven barrels would be allowable by special permit of the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9247.628s">Well,</a> who's the barrel police and what's the parameter? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9252.632s">Is</a> it seven barrels a day, seven barrels a week, seven barrels a month, seven barrels a year? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9256.595s">I</a> guess is my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9257.876s">It's</a> not going to prevent me from voting on the ordinance this evening, Mr. President, but I certainly think it's food for thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9263.141s">I</a> don't think that we're going to have somebody out there that's going to be the barrel police that's measuring liquid to see who serves seven barrels versus seven and a quarter or seven and a half or eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9271.808s">And</a> I just don't see how that aspect of the ordinance is enforceable and what precludes somebody from <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9277.492s">applying</a> for a special permit by right at seven barrels, but then going over the seven barrel. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9286.109s">limit</a> how are we going to know, how are we going to enforce, what's the parameters and standards that are going to be put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9291.813s">That's</a> the only issue that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9293.875s">But</a> this is taking too long for us to come to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9297.478s">So</a> with that being said, if it does pose a problem, we can always take it up at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9301.861s">But</a> I do think that that's a deficiency in our ordinance here this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9446.676s">I</a> certainly can appreciate the gentleman seeing through the trees to see the forest. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9452.818s">It</a> was about taxation and how we were going to recuperate money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9455.78s">And</a> I'm confident that we'll be all right moving forward with the languages here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9461.102s">So</a> with that being said, but it was more about how we're going to be able to monitor it because it's a revenue generating issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9466.364s">So</a> his astute business mind picked up on that relatively quickly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9552.176s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9614.577s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to sever the CAC ordinance from the zoning ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9674.147s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9678.123s">In</a> review of the selection committee ordinance, I see that our esteemed counsel from KP Law has failed to include the local 3% tax option language that was requested of him on multiple occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9695.367s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd make a motion to amend the CAC ordinance to have the city solicitor, not KP Law, as previously asked multiple times, but our city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9707.54s">to</a> draft language to include the local 3% tax option to generate revenues for the city as an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9718.768s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9741.763s">As</a> previously directed to KP law on multiple occasions and it never got in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=9745.265s">Yes,</a> that's correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10004.459s">Mr.</a> President, can I be so bold as to offer a motion to waive the reading of the paper?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10264.273s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, just a brief synopsis on this paper authorizes marijuana dispensaries to be located in industrial and commercial two districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10272.985s">It</a> adopts the state statutory buffer zones and has a number of requirements and restrictions in place relative to border health, fire, police, security, safety, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10283.79s">So</a> with that being said, I think we've all talked this thing to death at this point, and I'd move for approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10288.972s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10406.458s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10407.959s">Here</a> we are, what, ten months into the year, and we have a number of ordinances that we've requested drafts of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10414.562s">We've</a> gotten some back, we haven't gotten others. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10418.224s">With</a> the craziness that's going around with how government operates these days, with City Hall being half open and half closed, with the council being half open and half closed, I thought this would be a good opportunity for us to keep some of the items that this council's concerned about on the forefront, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10432.371s">I</a> know in the past, we've had situations where <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10435.572s">Papers</a> get filed and then they kick around for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10439.054s">For</a> example, the marijuana ordinance that we just talked about that took five years to come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10444.158s">So</a> with that being said, this is an effort as the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. President, to get our work product out and get it out in an expedient fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10451.062s">I</a> think ten months to wait is plenty of time for us to request an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10455.145s">And</a> if we can sit down with the city solicitor and go over where we are and the progress that we've made on some of these items, I think we'll be able to put out even a better work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10465.251s">This</a> council's shown that it's been able to put out ordinances and has quite a vision for what the legislative body should be doing and for what legislative process should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10476.024s">And</a> I just want to make sure, Mr. President, as the chairman of the subcommittee, that we're living up to the expectations of the residents here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10481.95s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10485.092s">It</a> would be three meetings, October, November, December, and the second Tuesday of each of those months for us to get a better handle on where we're at in the draft ordinance process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10495.038s">I've</a> had the opportunity to speak with Solicitor Scanlon, and she's started to do legwork for some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10500.261s">It's</a> no reflection on the work of her office or that of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10503.643s">What</a> it is, it's a reflection on this body and our willingness and desire to put out a favorable work product to the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10510.667s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.016s">Councilor</a> Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10611.696s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10613.096s">Since</a> the C-Click Fix program has been implemented, I have offered this resolution annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10617.958s">I</a> feel as though it's very important that the council be provided with a breakdown of what types of requests are being made by our citizenry and whether or not they're being brought to a resolve that meets their satisfaction and expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10629.94s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting this data because data drive decision making. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10634.501s">And</a> when we can take a look at these C-Click fix requests, we might also be able to identify where our deficiencies lie in the deliverance of services here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10645.413s">And</a> then when the budget process rolls around, we have a better idea as to where we need to invest our funds to be sure that the taxpayers are receiving the level of services that they're so duly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10657.084s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10660.645s">What</a> it is, is it's a tool for us to gather data to be more informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10663.886s">So</a> when the budget process starts, we can have the opportunity to reallocate funds to those areas where we feel as though we can do better.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10748.151s">Mr.</a> President, on that, I remember sitting back and we were talking about C-Click fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10753.933s">And</a> I believe it was a request that was made on DCR-owned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10761.054s">been</a> two previous administrations ago, maybe a previous administration ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10763.996s">And</a> the discussion was issue resolved, and the response was, that's state property, call the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10771.079s">And</a> that's the issue isn't resolved, the buck was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10773.461s">And</a> I remember Councilman Marks bringing that up, because he got a call from a resident that wasn't too satisfied with the answer that they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10779.203s">And</a> it was mocked as resolved, but it really wasn't resolved, it was closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10782.605s">So</a> I certainly share your position on this, Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=10788.276s">And</a> I'll be happy to amend the paper any which way that meets that objective.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11087.876s">I</a> don't, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the point there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11168.356s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11170.017s">The</a> condition that our public utility providers and others that are offered street opening permits leave our streets in is something that's been a topic of conversation before this board for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11182.705s">Earlier</a> this evening, for example, we had several grants of location and some of the things that we talked about were curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11189.005s">Paving,</a> how long the project's going to take, where the project's going to be located. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11193.43s">But</a> I think, Mr. President, a lot of these times when we issue a street opening permit, and maybe it's not for a half a mile of roadway like we issued earlier today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11202.28s">Maybe</a> it's only for 50 linear feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11205.063s">It</a> gets forgotten about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11206.565s">And</a> that final restoration never happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11208.967s">And</a> we've seen places all over the community where we see trenches and patches and road work that's just fallen apart that our public utilities have performed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11218.292s">We've</a> done a great job holding them accountable when they're coming before us for grants of location and things that are in our scope and our authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11224.056s">But</a> I think we can step it up a notch, Mr. President, and begin to look at the street opening permits when they're issued and what the follow-up protocols are to be sure that the taxpayers in the community and the residents in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11236.309s">are</a> afforded the opportunity to have their streets restored to the same condition that they were in prior to these construction and ground opening permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11242.891s">When</a> these ground opening permits are issued, it's usually for the purpose of underground utility work and underground utility upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11249.093s">And</a> these underground utility upgrades allow the city to generate <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11254.176s">the</a> ability to assess a personal property tax on the underground infrastructure that's being placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11259.382s">But</a> this underground infrastructure that's being placed along with the personal property tax that the city can get also provides the utility provider with the ability to have more efficient operations and in turn increase their profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11272.837s">So</a> when we talk a lot about what's going on in the community and community benefits, we look at public utility providers that are very protected and very insulated through state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11281.907s">That</a> aren't leaving our streets and our roadways in a condition that a lot of us feel would be suitable and satisfactory. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11287.353s">And</a> this is an effort to make sure that this stays in the forefront, Mr. President, with the monthly report letting us know what roadways have been ripped up, when the construction took place, when the construction was completed, and what the plans are in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11299.901s">After</a> six months, when they're going to get out there and get it done if they have to go there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11303.523s">It</a> also allows us the opportunity to monitor the list and make sure that after the six months is up that these roadways get restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11309.306s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11505.666s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11507.186s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11509.967s">I've</a> gotten a number of calls surrounding accounting, billing, and collections practices in the Treasurer-Collector's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11518.289s">When</a> we sit there and we look at what's going on, we have no assistant Treasurer-Collector. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11522.07s">We</a> have a temporary Treasurer-Collector, a part-time Treasurer-Collector that's a retiree that's been brought back. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11527.667s">So</a> in the interest of financial transparency, Mr. President, and to address some of the concerns that have been raised by those in the community, I'd request that an audit be conducted for the first 10 months of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11539.119s">When</a> we look at where we were this time a year ago, we had very, very, very aggressive collections under the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11548.683s">A</a> lot of money came in through the collections process, Mr. President, and I just want to make sure that we're doing the best that we can to ensure that these dollars are being captured and spent wisely.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11714.545s">Mr.</a> President, I'd be happy to amend the paper to get three years of the last three years of the audits in that department to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11721.15s">And</a> then if there's any concern, I can pursue this paper at a future time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11725.393s">I'd</a> ask the Councilor if that would satisfy his question and maybe allow him the opportunity to support this paper with that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11736.782s">So</a> often as a motion to amend Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11748.408s">Last</a> three years of the auditor's reports to the Treasurer-Collector's Office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11846.574s">I</a> don't want this to turn into a referendum on the qualifications or the abilities of Mr. Pompeo, but Mr. Pompeo is also limited to the number of hours that he can work as a retiree. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11856.647s">So</a> as a retiree in the public pension system, he's limited to 960 hours a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11864.286s">If</a> there's no assistant, then he's limited to 960 hours a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11867.448s">That's</a> why I raised the concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11869.75s">But</a> it's not a reflection of the duties or the work that he does down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11872.652s">It's</a> a reflection of the staffing levels down there and the level of productivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11877.656s">But</a> with that being said, I've amended the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11879.497s">I</a> just don't want this to be turned into a referendum on Mr. Pompeo because that wasn't my intention in any way, shape, or form.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11954.961s">Big</a> picture of Mr. President would be the way that I'd like to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11957.742s">Three</a> years, 12 months in a packet, you know what I mean, is the way that I'd prefer it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=11965.605s">Then</a> we can take a look at those monthlies afterwards and see, you know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12120.013s">I'd</a> be happy to support that amendment, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12311.858s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12313.119s">Councilor</a> Caraviello, thank you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12314.76s">And</a> Richie, thank you for everything that you do to the City of Medford, for the City of Medford, in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12320.983s">Richard</a> has been a great business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12323.084s">He's</a> the type of business that we want to have here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12326.445s">When</a> the pandemic hit, you saw what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12329.247s">He</a> put out jersey barriers, he put out a tent, he has live entertainment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12332.728s">He's</a> trying to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12334.994s">the</a> sense of community going here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12336.975s">He</a> does a great job, as Councilor Caraviello said, the countless, countless, countless deliveries of food to people's homes when their loved ones pass away, unsolicited, unwanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12349.904s">In</a> some instances, Mr. President, Richie goes above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12352.946s">And</a> not just in terms of being a business owner, but in terms of being a community partner and someone that really loves the city of Medford, cares for the city of Medford, and wants to make it a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12362.933s">So</a> with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12364.394s">through</a> you to Richie and to his staff, Peter and Jason and everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12369.775s">Thank</a> you very much for all you do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12551.229s">Again,</a> I defer to the senior member, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12593.245s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12594.726s">Yeah,</a> as Councilor Caraviello mentioned, Teresa was the wife of former city manager John Glioni. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12604.109s">And</a> when John was here running the city, Teresa was running the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12609.731s">As</a> they always say, behind every good man is a better woman, and this is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12614.793s">What</a> a great family the Glioni's raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12617.735s">My</a> dear friend, Janine McGonigal, Teresa was her mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12621.844s">And</a> she will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12623.705s">I'd</a> just like to offer my condolences to the family and ask that my council colleagues join Councilor Caraviello and I in doing the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12897.543s">Relatively</a> self-explanatory, Mr. President, in the September 8th packet, we did receive a draft ordinance that we requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12903.005s">I</a> believe it was at the direction of Councilor Caraviello, and based off a previous paper that was issued in the previous session, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12909.907s">But</a> with that being said, the solicitor's office has put out a work product for us to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=12913.829s">And</a> I'd ask that a COW be scheduled so that we can have the opportunity to do such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13032.159s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13034.892s">The</a> Knight Early Education Academy over on Woburn Street has been up and running now for almost a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13043.179s">And</a> it's a trying experience, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13048.224s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13051.4s">One</a> thing I'm noticing is that there's a need for us to be sure that those that don't have the same opportunities as others are still being provided the access to a quality public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13065.197s">And</a> truancy is one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13067.86s">one</a> of those situations that's something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13071.042s">And</a> our surrounding communities, some of them have multiple full-time truancy offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13075.724s">I</a> believe at one point the city of Somerville had three full-time truancy offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13080.867s">I'm</a> not saying or alluding to the fact that truancy is a problem in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13085.529s">But</a> what I am saying is that based upon the new times that are before us and the expectations that have been expressed through our school committee and through that of DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13096.896s">the</a> direction of the superintendent, ultimately our goal is to get kids back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13101.643s">But</a> until then, we're going to be relying on remote learning or hybrid learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13106.53s">And</a> my <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13108.703s">concern</a> is that certain subsects of our population are going to slip through the cracks and not be provided with the same opportunities that others are being provided during this time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13118.49s">So</a> as the parent of a first grader and understanding that during these formidable years, the importance that education plays in the long-term development of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13128.917s">an</a> academic student raises concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13132.338s">So</a> I'd ask that the school committee just provide us with a report as to what their plans are and how to address truancy during the pandemic and during the hybrid learning, during from home learning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13144.3s">I</a> think it's very important that we understand what's going on so that we can ensure that all the students across the board are being provided with an ample opportunity to be educated properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13155.991s">I'd</a> like to further amend the paper to Mr. President and request a report from the school department indicating how many students we've lost to private schools between last year and this year due to the school closures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13167.383s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13207.22s">Mr.</a> President, although the committee does not report to the council in terms of policy, the buck does stop here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13212.963s">The</a> buck stops here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13214.844s">So</a> if we're seeing a problem with truancy and we have one part-time truancy officer here in the community, maybe the council says it's time to kick it up a notch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13221.827s">Maybe</a> you gotta hire a couple more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13224.288s">And</a> if you don't, then maybe we're going to have to hold back some funding over here until you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13228.71s">So</a> there's an opportunity in a way for us, Mr. President, very similar to the way that we were able to <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13233.072s">broker</a> a deal with the historical commission and the property owner to promote and push for certain aspects of a better quality public education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13243.677s">And</a> where the council controls the purse strings, and truancy is a concern, and there's a school department policy and a city policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13251.761s">I</a> do believe that surrounds some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13253.582s">I</a> think it's important that we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13255.662s">I</a> guess my question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13256.983s">Why</a> don't we want to know what their policy is on truancy? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13260.264s">And</a> why wouldn't we expect them to have one? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13262.965s">It's</a> not so much that we want to force something down their throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13266.687s">All</a> we're doing is asking them to report back to the council with a report on what its plans are to address truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13274.069s">It's</a> not a request to tell them to make a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13276.17s">It's</a> not a request to tell them how to do it, where to do it, or when to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13279.151s">It's</a> a request to fill us in and give us information as to what you're doing to make sure that this situation doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13285.636s">I</a> can certainly appreciate the council's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13288.678s">However,</a> knowledge is power and the more knowledge we have, the better off we're going to be and the better job we're going to be able to do for the people and especially the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13296.543s">As</a> a parent, Mr. President, this is very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13300.046s">Two</a> young children at home, a six year old and a four year old. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13303.428s">The</a> day before school was supposed to start, my four year old lost his daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13308.131s">So</a> people are struggling through this, and the more information that we have, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13312.476s">And</a> the other thing that's important, Mr. President, is if we do see a truancy problem, usually the truancy problem isn't necessarily rooted in anything other than things going on at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13323.628s">And</a> while the school committee does have certain authority, the city has far more resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13329.474s">when</a> it comes down to family issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=13332.116s">So</a> that's another opportunity, Mr. President, for us to gain some more information and then maybe modify or amend the types of services that we deliver to the residents here based upon the data that we're receiving to see what makes sense to be sure that the taxpayers are getting the level of services that they so deserve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14056.123s">Mr.</a> President, I do remember, maybe, was it five weeks ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14061.846s">You</a> sent an email out to the administration talking about $250,000 that was part of our agreement with cable, our cable agreement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14075.223s">And</a> I don't believe we ever got a response as to whether or not those funds were going to be appropriated or how they were going to be utilized, did we? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14084.502s">It</a> was a form letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14086.663s">Similar</a> to a form letter, if I'm not mistaken.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14093.987s">May</a> I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that a portion of the $250,000 from the cable agreement be allotted for the purpose of hiring an election coordinator for the November general election? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14109.294s">And</a> can I be so bold as to suggest that in the form of a amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14113.036s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14116.178s">I</a> don't want to steal your thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=14117.058s">You're</a> the guy that found the money, John, but let's spend it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15364.962s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15368.404s">The</a> idea was raised as part of a committee report during our budget discussions, something I brought up when we were looking at the projections during the COVID-19 circumstance and the budget deliberations relative to the anticipated forecasted revenues that were going to be coming in through the various departments that are revenue generating. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15391.927s">the</a> building department and their building permits, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15395.608s">And</a> when we sat down with the finance director and we saw what the trends were and what the projections were, we took a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15404.011s">And</a> that vote was to have quarterly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15407.532s">with</a> the finance director to update us on where we are currently in terms of collections and where our projections are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15415.659s">And</a> this is a follow-up to that recommendation that was made during the budget hearings back in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15421.424s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to support it as the first quarter was July, August, and September. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15427.149s">And</a> September is going to be closing at the end of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15429.411s">Our</a> next meeting is October. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15432.934s">Sixth</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15433.715s">You</a> are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15434.375s">And</a> the meeting after that I'd ask that the finance director be prepared to appear before the council at a council meeting and give us an update as to where we are on forecast and projected revenues.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15602.914s">Mr.</a> President, I thank the councilors for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15607.174s">I'd</a> also, I think it's very important that we recognize the work of our Substance Abuse and Prevention Office and where they've come in such a short time since being created. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15618.397s">The</a> office has only been in effect now for maybe what, five years, six years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15622.998s">And</a> the strides that they've made in this community in terms of education and outreach have been <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15629.099s">enumerable</a> compared to where we were before to where we are today, the level of services that we offer as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15637.341s">But</a> I think it's also important, Mr. President, to recognize that in the spirit of National Recovery Month, that this is a resolution that we must support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15646.804s">And</a> I wholeheartedly will vote entirely in favor of it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15856.844s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=15945.382s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16158.022s">Motion</a> to table the committee reports.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16193.851s">Mr.</a> President, on the records of August 25th, I'd like to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16197.092s">If</a> we table these, any further 30 days will pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16199.492s">The</a> open meeting law says that it's best practice to have them approved within 30 days of passage, of completion of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16205.574s">So</a> I'd move for approval of the August 25th- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dQwFkF1-J44&t=16208.014s">You</a> have 15 minutes.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4/2024-11-19_ODT3XVbBhL4.html">City Council 09-08-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=255.109s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=255.509s">I</a> do believe Councilor Caballero was the moving party taken off the table, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=286.026s">OK,</a> on the motion of Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=288.845s">Is</a> John McLaughlin available, the facilities director?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=308.117s">She's</a> John's boss, so she should probably be.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=313.284s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=313.544s">I'd</a> just like to give us a breakdown as to where funds are going to be expended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=317.467s">That</a> was the reason why we tabled it last week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=332.495s">I</a> believe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=386.12s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=386.441s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=387.842s">Thank</a> you, Dr. Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=388.743s">I</a> appreciate you being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=390.685s">Now,</a> these funds, this $800 and somewhat thousand dollars, these funds are for capital improvements, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=397.812s">They're</a> not for any personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=399.313s">They</a> can't bring reading specialists back into the classroom or anything like that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=402.716s">These</a> are just for capital expenses?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=435.367s">Right,</a> but so the council's tabling of this item did not prevent the school department from bringing any teachers or any classroom teachers back, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=443.13s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=444.37s">Excellent,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=444.97s">Because</a> sometimes there's a lot of misinformation that travels around the community, and that was something that was going around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=450.732s">So</a> I just wanted to be sure, Dr. Vincent, that we were all clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=453.653s">that</a> the funds here that were tabled by the council at the last meeting were for capital funds only. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=458.155s">But</a> the council did last meeting, I believe, increase the school department's budget by $1.08 million that would allow for those positions to be restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=465.377s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=467.678s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=468.458s">And</a> after last week's meeting, I did have the opportunity to pick up the phone and make a telephone call to John McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=474.281s">And</a> I spoke with John at length and he explained to me the situation at the high school especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=479.042s">relative</a> to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=483.285s">He</a> also explained to me that there were some air quality tests that were conducted that came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=488.267s">And</a> for the most part, all of our schools came back with very good reviews, with the exception of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=493.31s">And</a> I think we all know what school that is, Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=496.452s">So</a> with that being said, Dr. Vincent, could you tell us a little bit about the scope of work that you're looking to spend this $800 and some odd thousand dollars on, please?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=745.701s">And</a> in terms of total cost for us to bring our HVAC system at Medford High School into compliance and I guess efficient and effective working order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=758.714s">Is</a> this $816 enough money to do that or will there be a request for a supplemental appropriation at a later date going forward?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=809.746s">And</a> is it still the wishes of the committee to have this account be exclusive to Medford High School only and to the other schools?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=866.023s">The</a> reason I raise the question is because the way that the paper was drafted was that it would be reprogramming the funds to an account exclusive to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=876.626s">And</a> I know maybe Alicia's on the call, maybe Alicia can elaborate a little bit on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=880.587s">But</a> I do believe that when it was presented that those funds were restricted exclusively to Medford High School and were not going to be allowed to be used in other schools in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=888.489s">If</a> I'm mistaken, please correct me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=891.47s">But</a> maybe Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=892.471s">Nunley</a> can help us out with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=934.608s">So</a> it's the committee's, the school department's wishes to keep the paper as is and not amend it and allow it for just MHS only because it's only $800,000 and you can spend that all up at the high school, no problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=992.049s">It's</a> certainly not a problem for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=994.051s">The</a> paper came from the administration, so maybe Aleesha Nunley, my finance director, can talk a little bit about that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1048.278s">So</a> we'd have to amend the paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1059.947s">Mr.</a> President, I would offer that in the form of a motion to amend the paper to reflect that these funds can be used across the school district, not just exclusive to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1066.512s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1095.135s">That</a> is correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1101.16s">That's</a> it for me, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=1102.001s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5037.123s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5039.165s">I</a> don't have much to say about the paper, but I did want to <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5042.067s">Welcome</a> aboard, Assistant Superintendent Murphy, and thank him for going through his initiation this evening as his first appearance before the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5049.992s">I</a> do look forward to meeting him in a less formal setting, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5066.023s">On</a> the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5070.01s">Councilor</a> Morell.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5125.776s">I</a> will second it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5176.551s">They</a> were co-sponsors of the amendment and I moved to second them all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5215.794s">We're</a> under suspension, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5218.295s">Paper</a> 20517, the companion paper to the paper that was just on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5221.496s">Move</a> for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5222.937s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5227.167s">So</a> we took seven first? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5228.127s">We</a> took seven first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5230.208s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5230.308s">Well,</a> let's give them the big money now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5231.809s">Still</a> second.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5284.315s">Mr.</a> President, why don't we transfer all the amendments from the past paper to this paper?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5567.14s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5568.421s">I</a> think this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5572.022s">However,</a> the reason that it's being filed is not so self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5576.805s">Here</a> in our community now, I've never served on the council at a time where I've gotten more calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5583.92s">about</a> permits being delayed, demolition delays, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5589.262s">And</a> I'd like to take a review of the annual reports as required by the Historical Commission to be filed with the administration to take a look at what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5598.146s">My</a> brief research on this topic has shown me, Mr. President, that since 2009, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5603.628s">There</a> have been over 50 plus cases where demolition delay has been implemented in the community, but only four homes have not been demolished during this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5611.432s">Four</a> buildings, I should say, not even homes, buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5613.413s">Four</a> buildings have not been demolished. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5618.222s">the</a> success rate is minimal, is minimal at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5622.406s">So</a> I have a number of questions like, have these four homes been restored or did they just not get demolished? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5627.731s">Were</a> they restored to a historic state or were they left there to just be the same way that they were before they were deemed to be historically significant or preferentially preserved? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5637.48s">Do</a> these 50 plus cases include applicants who are delayed and withdrew their appeal? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5644.166s">the</a> 18 month or the six month period was up at the time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5649.607s">I'm</a> getting a lot of pushback and a lot of phone calls about people who feel as though the demolition delay is being used as a weapon against them for not complying with certain requirements and certain things that are being demanded of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5663.671s">And</a> it's starting to become very problematic, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5666.731s">And</a> the reason I say it's problematic is because when we look at what's going on in this community right now, when we look at our financial situation here in this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5673.973s">If</a> we don't embrace development in the very near future, I'm going to say we don't have the ability to meet our payroll next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5682.076s">For</a> the past five years, we've generated at least $1.5 million in new growth in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5689.64s">And</a> that $1.5 million is necessary for us to just meet the contractual obligations of our payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5696.602s">This</a> fiscal year, we've estimated our new growth to be at $1 million, not $1.5 million as it has been for the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5704.293s">This</a> coupled with the fact that we have certain sectors of our economy that we need to bring back, like the restaurant industry and the hotel industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5712.4s">Because</a> those sectors allow us to raise additional revenues here for the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5718.845s">So</a> I think we've done a great job in expanding the offerings that we have for outdoor dining in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5723.609s">And</a> we need to do that because the meals tax is a benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5728.354s">that</a> we get when our restaurants do well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5732.076s">And</a> the same goes for our hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5733.797s">If</a> hotels are being turned over, we get a tax on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5737.518s">And</a> right now, with one in five adults out of work, 20% unemployment across the commonwealth, I think it's important for us to look down the line a little bit at what the financial situation is going to be in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5752.045s">And</a> unless we start embracing development, generating permitting fees and new growth, we're not going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5758.148s">in</a> a strong financial position come this time next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5763.59s">And</a> a lot of this, I think, surrounds some of the work that's being done relative to demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5768.491s">And</a> now the next layer of that, which is going to be if you want a permit for basic <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5774.807s">repairs</a> or modifications to your home, you're also going to have to go before that other layer of bureaucracy and potentially be subject to an 18 month delay in the issuance of your permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5785.573s">And</a> I think that's a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5787.393s">So</a> I raise this issue because we've asked for a committee of the whole on this months and months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5791.395s">It</a> hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5792.056s">We've</a> asked for reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5794.377s">We</a> haven't gotten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5797.078s">We</a> haven't gotten them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5798.614s">So</a> here I am looking at this saying, what can we do in this community to help dig us out of this economic crisis? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5805.8s">Well,</a> one of those things we can do is develop wisely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5809.303s">Another</a> thing we can do is generate permitting fees through development that's going to bolster. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5816.68s">When</a> we sat down and we talked about the budget, the biggest thing we talked about was the $2.4 million deficit in forecasted permitting fees out of the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5826.143s">And</a> how are we going to climb out of this hole? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5829.164s">Well,</a> I can tell you by making people who want to invest in our community jump through hoops for 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5836.962s">That's</a> not going to do anything to jumpstart our economics, that's not going to do anything to generate more permitting fees, and that's not going to do anything to put us in a better economic and financial situation here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5848.905s">Preserving</a> historic homes is important, but I think we're going a bit too far at this point now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5854.106s">I</a> think we're going a bit too far, and I think we really need to look at it, because quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5860.587s">If</a> you have someone that wants to do a development in this community and they're subject to the demolition delay, the next thing that happens is the historical commission presents itself as a design review board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5873.692s">That</a> says, well, show us your designs and if we like them, then we'll let you move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5878.673s">But</a> nothing's to say that the designs that they show the historic commission are going to be approved by the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5884.615s">So</a> we have a situation where we have someone that's looking to invest money in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5889.946s">who</a> could be held up for 18 months at historic and then have to go through the whole process of the ZBA where they may or may not ever, ever get an approval for any design that they're seeking to implement in this community if variance is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5903.733s">I</a> just think that it's very unfair, Mr. President, and rule number one in government for me has always been do no harm. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5909.615s">Do</a> no harm, rule number one in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5912.377s">We</a> had to help people, not hurt people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5914.678s">And</a> when someone comes into the community and buys a parcel and wants to knock it down, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5919.927s">And</a> when they buy the parcel, the home's just a junky home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5923.153s">And</a> when they want to knock it down, it becomes historically significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5926.42s">And</a> they've invested $750,000, $600,000, their life savings into these parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5932.865s">It's</a> a life changing decision that's being made by a board or a commission that can harm these individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5940.931s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we revisit the criteria, the circumstances, and the processes that we have in place when it comes down to the demolition delay or portions thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5952.179s">We</a> spoke about it several weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5954.32s">And</a> we called for a need for a committee of the whole on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5957.523s">And</a> I ask that it be scheduled sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5960.526s">And</a> the reason I ask is because people are being hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5963.488s">People</a> are being hurt financially in their pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5968.132s">When</a> one in five adults in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are unemployed and people are coming to Medford looking to invest money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5975.559s">I</a> think we should embrace them and work with them, not against them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5979.183s">So</a> with that being said, I ask for these reports to be issued and furnished to the council so that I can review them further and prepare myself for a committee of the whole, which is going to be scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5986.832s">I</a> have faith and confidence that it's going to get done, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5989.114s">I</a> know we're working under very strange circumstances these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5992.498s">I</a> feel like I'm at the zoo right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=5997.303s">Zoo,</a> circus, the case could be made for either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6000.646s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution to get this information so that when we do have this further discussion and this further dialogue, we're all well informed as to what goes on, what the process is, and what the pros and cons of our ordinance is right now and how it affects people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6017.984s">So</a> with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6039.881s">Both</a> equally important issues, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6119.329s">And</a> I'm not talking about developers, Mr. President, like Locust Street or like Moderna or Mill Creek. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6127.295s">I'm</a> talking about the local builder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6130.417s">I'm</a> talking about someone that wants to come in and make an investment in the community, someone that's going to maybe renovate a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6136.502s">Maybe</a> come in and do an addition to a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6138.764s">Maybe</a> someone that's going to come in and knock down a parcel that's <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6142.543s">a</a> single family home in an apartment two district and create a tax base for us with an apartment there that complies with the existing zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6149.931s">That's</a> what I'm talking about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6151.352s">I'm</a> not talking about these big wig developers that are coming in here from Boston that are just going to throw millions and millions of dollars away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6159.201s">I'm</a> talking about builders that have a very small margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6163.285s">And</a> if they're tied up for eight, nine, or ten months and it costs them $80,000 to $100,000, they have a very difficult time surviving. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6170.829s">And</a> when you look at these small builders, you also have to understand that they probably employ between 50 and 60 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6178.373s">50</a> and 60 people that are going to be doing a job in this community, that are going to have the opportunity to spend their money in our local business districts for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6190.395s">in</a> our gas stations to gas up their cars, in our local hardware stores to pick up supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6197.157s">So</a> it all goes to the circular flow of our economy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6200.357s">But</a> I think it's very important that we look at this, and I know that we have a number of items on the agenda, and I don't want to go any longer than I already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6206.399s">So</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6250.499s">Not</a> a scare tactic, a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6252.72s">There</a> were 50 plus homes that have gone through the demolition delay and only four were saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6256.462s">That's</a> not a scare tactic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6257.743s">That's</a> the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6258.263s">That's</a> the facts that were included in the packet that were given to us by the <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6262.812s">Medford</a> Historic District Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6265.233s">And</a> it came in the packet this evening, even though we've asked for it, I can't tell you how many months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6269.434s">And</a> the packet that it came in this evening is unrelated to the council request that came back previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6274.595s">Not</a> a scare tactic, Mr. President, just a fact.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6411.046s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6411.726s">I</a> certainly support the councilor's position to accelerate the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6414.607s">Maybe</a> that's why we need to look at whether or not an 18-month delay is appropriate or whether it should be reverted back to six.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6421.008s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6440.837s">She'll</a> make a motion for the chair to make a ruling.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6492.84s">I</a> am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6494.161s">Just</a> a request for information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6662.765s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe statutorily, underneath the Department of Revenue, we are required to do real valuation every, I believe it's eight years, a defined period of eight years, every eight years we do a <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6674.137s">It's</a> 05 is it now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6675.058s">I</a> think I might have changed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=6675.88s">So</a> we actually do have a team that goes out into the community and does assessments, real assessments based upon appraisals as required by the Department of Revenue and in compliance thereof.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7351.922s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7353.343s">It's</a> with deep sadness that I offer this resolution this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7356.784s">Eddie</a> Terrence was a kid, I grew up with him, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7360.085s">A</a> West Medford fixture, a West Medford legend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7363.426s">Had</a> the opportunity of going to elementary school with Eddie, high school with Eddie, and always hanging out with him down the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7370.376s">Whether</a> it be placed in a park or dug a park, playing basketball, everywhere in between, causing havoc, riding our bikes and the such, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7377.439s">But</a> Eddie passed away unexpectedly just over the last couple of weeks with a little heart problem, a little heart trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7385.083s">And</a> he's no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7386.884s">And</a> Eddie was the type of kid that made everybody around him just better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7391.826s">When</a> Eddie was there, he put you in a better mood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7393.347s">He</a> had a smile that could light up a room and a personality that could make the shyest person the most friendly person in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7399.569s">A</a> long time husband to Donna Doherty, CJ Doherty and Chuck Doherty's daughter and sister. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7406.572s">And</a> just an all around great kid, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7409.773s">And</a> I'm very sad to see him go and it's one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7414.007s">situations</a> where when someone's gone, you wish you had the opportunity to spend more time with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7417.588s">And</a> Eddie was one of those kids, and I don't think there's anybody that knows Eddie that could say right now that they wish they didn't spend more time with him now that he's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7425.312s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in offering an offerings of condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7431.734s">It's</a> very unfortunate turn of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7437.501s">I</a> was on social media the other day and someone posted a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7443.187s">And</a> it was a picture right across the hall in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7446.19s">And</a> it was Eddie sitting down in Mayor McGlynn's chair with Mayor McGlynn next to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7452.203s">There</a> was a kid named Cedric Taylor sitting next to Eddie, who's no longer with us as well, and Justin Springer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7458.445s">And</a> if we think back to a couple months ago, this council just recognized Justin Springer for the work that he's done in the city of Boston, doing outreach and communications work with the less fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7470.149s">So</a> it's very sad, Mr. President, when you reach a certain age and you see a picture like that of kids you grew up with in elementary school and in junior high and in high school, and two out of three of them are gone, they're no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7480.893s">So</a> it just saddens me to see that he's gone, because like I said, he's a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7484.096s">And</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting the family and offering this condolence to the family in this time of need.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7714.501s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7717.782s">We've</a> all been around Gail Armstrong, Richie Raymond, Sean Mangan at one point or another being involved in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7727.148s">And</a> the outreach work that Armstrong Ambulance does and the give backs that they give to this community are innumerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7735.648s">Just</a> recently, about a month ago, Armstrong Ambulance was tasked with the responsibility of helping do COVID testing for the MHS families up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7747.114s">And</a> to say that that was a momentous task is an understatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7751.336s">But</a> through their efforts and that of our friends in the Board of Health, they were able to pull it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7757.218s">When</a> you look at the testing that's been done in our community versus surrounding communities, you'll see that Medford's probably, at the time that this was done, about 1,000 tests ahead of the nearest community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7770.349s">I</a> think the only community around here was Lynn that had tested more people than the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7776.414s">So</a> it goes to say and it goes to show that <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7780.397s">The</a> strength of community partnerships can go a long way in all aspects of public life, but especially public health here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7787.282s">We've</a> seen the community rise up and come together during this coronavirus situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7792.927s">And</a> I think that the efforts in the work of Gail, Richie, and Sean shouldn't go unnoticed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7800.092s">Not</a> only in this endeavor, but in all that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7803.814s">Whether</a> it comes to the free CPI training that they give to our coaches or the IADs that they've donated to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7810.698s">Armstrong</a> does a lot, and I think it's important that we recognize what they do and the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7815.42s">So</a> with that being said, I'm asking my council colleagues to support me in this agenda item this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7908.178s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7909.479s">And</a> I know Councilor Marks has a similar paper on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=7913.983s">I</a> bring this paper forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8009.706s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and thank you to Councilor Marks for allowing me to proceed first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8014.871s">I</a> bring this paper forward, Mr. President, in light of a recent string of troubling events that have been brought to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8021.557s">Home</a> break-ins in the West Medford neighborhood, home invasions in the heights in South Medford, in the West Medford neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8031.105s">We</a> have a crime analyst, Mr. President, that we budgeted, and the crime analyst does an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8035.786s">And</a> I know that our decision makers in the police department are using that data to make good policy recommendations and good policing recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8045.868s">But</a> I think it's also important, Mr. President, that we have the opportunity to review this data to see what type of crime is happening in our community, whether it's violent crime, whether it's crime of personal property, whether it's domestic violence, whether it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8061.112s">any</a> number of identifiable trends or patents that will allow us to be dynamic and flexible in our response to it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8071.423s">I'm</a> more than happy to sit down and discuss supplemental funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8075.087s">I'm</a> more than happy to sit down and discuss providing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8079.588s">any</a> department in this community with the tools that they need to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8082.871s">And</a> I think it's very important for us to have a good understanding as to what the trends are and what the patents are in this community, so that we can get ahead of it and invest money in certain areas that we need to invest money in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8093.121s">For</a> example, we have Harold McGilvery, he's our dog officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8096.604s">He's</a> an awesome dog officer, he does a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8100.375s">Maybe</a> based upon the crime statistic and crime trends, we need two dog officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8104.778s">We</a> have a traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8105.859s">We</a> have a traffic division comprised of so many officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8109.321s">Maybe</a> based upon the crime statistics and the accident statistics, it shows that we should be having more officers in the traffic division and less officers in another division. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8118.367s">Operational</a> questions, Mr. President, certainly stuff that comes under the purview and scope of the Chief of Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8123.75s">But</a> that's something that's contingent and reliant upon funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8127.351s">And</a> if we're going to be spending the money, I want to make sure we're spending it in the right place to make the most impact and the most bang for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8133.612s">And</a> with the uptick in violent crime in this community, I think this is something that we really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8138.172s">And</a> I shouldn't even say it's an uptick, because I don't know, because I haven't seen the stats. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8141.593s">I</a> should say with the public reporting of violent crime of recent in the community, I'm wondering if this is something that we need to be worried about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8149.254s">So</a> with that being said, I'm going to defer to Councilor Marks, Mr. President, but thank you very much for indulging me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8502.238s">I</a> do not believe we had a crime analyst going back that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8507.6s">I</a> think a crime analyst was something that <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8512.401s">I</a> believe in your first term, Councilor Scott-Pelly's first term was something that we had put into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8517.863s">So</a> while I think that the data exists in terms of paper records and paper files, there wasn't someone there that was actually working as a crime analyst compiling that stuff and looking at trends and patterns and the such. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8530.107s">So</a> I'd ask that it be offered in the B papers to not hold up the underlying paper that's been offered on top of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8630.273s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8631.754s">That's</a> on from the beginning.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8974.698s">Mr.</a> President, I find this ironic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8977.6s">I</a> find it ironic that the MBTA cuts the express bus service that people take. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8982.785s">because</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8984.439s">The</a> other modes of transit that the t office is so inefficient and unreliable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8989.182s">I</a> mean, ultimately, you take the bus, you take the 325. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8991.084s">Councilor</a> Marks takes the 325. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=8993.546s">You</a> take the 325 because you don't want to take a bus to a train station and miss the bus or wait for a bus that's late to get to the train station to be packed in like a sardine or miss the first two trains when you get there because there's no room for you to get on the train. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9005.614s">So</a> it's nonsensical to me in a way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9009.277s">It's</a> like they created these express lanes because people, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9013.8s">Needed</a> to get to work and couldn't rely on the existing modalities that the MBTA was offering, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9019.642s">So</a> here we are now, going back, and they're going to cut these from our community, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9023.683s">They're</a> going to cut them, okay, that's what you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9026.163s">I'm</a> assuming that there's going to be a corresponding cut in our assessment, because our assessment's based on the level of service that we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9032.405s">And</a> if they're cutting our services, then they should also be cutting our assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9035.646s">So</a> my question would be also, what impact does this have on the MBTA's assessment to the community of Medford, where they're cutting service for the bus line. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9043.268s">The</a> assessments for our bus service should be cut as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9045.71s">So</a> I'd ask that question as to what the correlating assessment reduction with the reduction in these bus lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=9053.056s">I'd</a> offer that in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10081.584s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and through to the city clerk and his team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10086.468s">Babe,</a> Janice Haley, the registrars of voters, they didn't have an easy task. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10093.574s">And</a> they really didn't know what was going on until the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10097.697s">And</a> I think that the state didn't help us out in allowing us ample opportunity to plan properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10103.262s">And</a> because of that, we met some bumps in the road and snafus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10107.325s">But</a> I think it's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10110.268s">the</a> hours of work that these employees put in during early voting, vote by mail, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10118.614s">And</a> it expands further than just the clerk's office and the registrar's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10121.836s">So</a> the countless volunteers that were up here hour after hour, day after day during early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10127.36s">So</a> I think it's important to point out that mistakes will happen and mistakes do happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10130.922s">And</a> as long as we identify that a mistake happened, we own it, which is one of Clerk Hurtubise's favorite things to do when a mistake happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10139.168s">Provide</a> corrective action, we're all going to be in a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10142.391s">And</a> I think that the clerk has the team around him that's going to allow him to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10147.896s">All</a> right, so with that being said, Mr. President, I know there were some bumps in the road, and I know that it could have been handled a little bit smoother. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10155.083s">And</a> I have all the confidence in the world and the team that's down there now that this won't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10160.748s">But</a> getting back to operations, and from an operational standpoint, <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10165.551s">Would</a> it make sense for us, because of COVID, to condense the number of polling locations? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10174.97s">Just</a> a question to put out there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10177.05s">Do</a> we need 15 polling locations when we have early voting and vote by mail, and then a lower turnout at the polls because of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10187.133s">It's</a> a question to chew on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10188.553s">It's</a> a policy question that's going to have to go through the Board of Registrars of Voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10192.274s">I</a> know that it would probably require a homeward petition, because state law does mandate that I think there's, what, 4,000 voters per precinct, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10200.936s">So</a> it would take some work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10202.636s">But</a> I don't know if it's an effort worth exploring or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10205.938s">For</a> the simple fact that it will reduce the cost of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10209.199s">There's</a> ample opportunity and time for people to come in and early vote, vote by mail, and absentee vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10216.043s">And</a> we can consolidate the locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10217.825s">We</a> won't need as much personnel, so the margin of error might be smaller, is all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=10222.007s">So</a> it's something to talk about, something to think about, Mr. President, that I look forward to discussing at a future committee of the whole, if possible.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=11154.464s">Mr.</a> President, I second the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12006.282s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12008.184s">Now,</a> we've been doing this Zoom thing now for what, since St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12011.207s">Patty's</a> Day?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12012.588s">All</a> right, so that's going back to March 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12014.47s">March</a> 17th, we've been doing the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12016.832s">Almost</a> six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12017.813s">I</a> don't like Zoom at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12019.254s">I</a> think it's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12019.975s">I</a> have a terrible setup for it in my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12021.436s">I</a> got two young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12022.317s">I</a> can't put them on lockdown for seven and eight and nine hour long meetings and tell them, don't say a word in the house, guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12027.462s">I</a> got a Zoom meeting going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12029.004s">All</a> right, it doesn't work for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12030.905s">But</a> I will say this, and I don't think anybody can shake a stick at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12033.488s">The</a> last two meetings that we've had in this chambers have been the best run meetings that we've had since St. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12037.671s">Patrick's</a> Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12039.093s">And</a> I'll be happy to say that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12040.734s">The</a> reason why is because we're in these chambers and we're doing business where business is supposed to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12045.738s">And</a> that's why when the governor issued his executive order, bodies public were exempt.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12720.175s">Mr.</a> Clark That is correct amend the paper to amend the council rules to mandate masks behind the rail
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12968.227s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12968.447s">Mr.</a> President, when do you plan on meeting with the Board of Health?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=12990.69s">So</a> you'd be meeting with just the Board of Health and the solicitor yourself behind closed doors and then coming up with a plan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13005.996s">Because</a> where it's, as a result of a council resolution, you might want to be careful meeting behind closed doors.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13334.124s">From</a> an operational standpoint, through you, through the author of the amendment, so does this feel like a standing <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13341.918s">COVID-19</a> updated every single council meeting by someone from the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13346.08s">I</a> mean, I'm just concerned about posting, you know, I mean, we've talked about suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13350.682s">We've</a> talked about how we're not bringing items under suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13353.863s">We</a> have posting requirements through the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13356.164s">So</a> would this be like a standing invitation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13358.024s">Is</a> it the first meeting of every month? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13360.205s">Is</a> it whenever the administration feels fit or is this gonna be one of those things where every month we say, okay, is anybody here from the administration that wants to come and give us an update on Corona? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13370.149s">Okay,</a> no, all right, moving on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13421.946s">So</a> it wouldn't be that they're necessarily appearing before the council and are on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13425.307s">The</a> request would be that they give us a weekly report as to the status.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13444.095s">Under</a> council purview or just in general?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13558.357s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13560.377s">Is</a> that an amendment?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13569.459s">So</a> we're going to strike the language at each forthcoming regular council meeting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13739.571s">Mr.</a> President, motion to refer to a committee of the whole for a presentation by the Historic District Commission, the owner of the property, before the City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13753.791s">Is</a> that OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13754.932s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13755.212s">From</a> the Historic District Commission, I think, would be the ones that are imposing this, presenting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13759.935s">So</a> the Historic District Commission can present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13761.756s">We'll</a> have the owner of the property there, as well as a representative from the mayor's office, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13766.479s">Today,</a> I had the opportunity to speak with Mayor Lungo on a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13769.741s">And</a> this topic came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13771.402s">And</a> she suggested that we meet in the Committee of the Whole, and she'll have a representative from her staff available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13776.966s">To</a> sit down with us and go over the paper as well as representatives from the Historic District Commission there, okay?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13810.179s">And</a> on to that point, Mr. President, I spoke with the mayor and she said that she would make someone available next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13815.442s">She</a> said she'd be willing to do that, but it would have to happen next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13869.694s">No</a> less than 10 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13905.188s">I'll</a> second that amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=13907.99s">To</a> meet within 10 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=14063.261s">Alright.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ODT3XVbBhL4&t=14066.583s">Mueller?</a> <h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ/2024-11-19_qIvMl_-GSJQ.html">City Council 08-25-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1.752s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=847.247s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=849.089s">I'd</a> like to recommend maybe a committee of the whole on this paper so that we can go over it in further detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=854.276s">There</a> are certainly some great aspects to it and some questions and concerns that I have relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=859.042s">whether</a> it applies to dumpster permits as well, whether or not we could extend this maybe to cover some compost files or some requirements around composting as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=868.728s">So</a> with that being said, I'd offer the motion that we convene in the committee of the whole to go over this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=873.812s">I'll</a> second that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=881.817s">It</a> would be the motions to just have a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=884.359s">So</a> I don't know if it has to be a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=885.8s">I'm</a> not amending it in any way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1076.904s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1078.366s">And</a> building on what Councilor Marks had to say, I think it makes great sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1083.09s">You</a> know, government's constructed to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1085.232s">Government's</a> constructed to deliver services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1087.614s">It</a> shouldn't be an us versus them situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1090.297s">When</a> someone calls and says they have an infestation problem in the neighborhood, that's a serious issue and a serious problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1095.862s">You</a> know, it's gross, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1097.865s">I</a> mean, government should be reaching out and doing all they can to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1100.568s">And</a> the property line should not be the determining factor as to whether or not individuals are going to be receiving government services, especially here at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1108.496s">You</a> know, I think that moving forward, enforcement is going to be an issue, but also our Board of Health reaching out and helping residents when they run into this situation, circumstance and helping them bait and coming up with a road and abatement plan for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1120.467s">And</a> maybe having some of these funds from the revolving account used to go back into the community to help people who are facing infestations, being able to fund some extermination services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1129.879s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking forward to meeting on this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1275.538s">Sandy</a> hasn't seen anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1276.659s">I</a> can read his lips.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1279.961s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1412.583s">This</a> is a resolution that is not intended to present another undue burden on our already struggling businesses that are facing the coronavirus epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1424.288s">However,</a> I do think we can do a better job in presenting some curb appeal when we're doing some of these outdoor dining license and outdoor dining establishments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1435.136s">For</a> example, we've seen what they've done down at Bistro 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1438.719s">They</a> put some lattice work up, they put a tent up, they put some lights up, and it looks nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1443.142s">But</a> then you go to other places in the community and you see the concrete Jersey barrier taken up five parking spots, and that's all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1449.406s">So</a> I'm hoping that maybe we can implement some minimum beautification standards on the outdoor dining license, Mr. President, so that when we do have areas that need to be protected with Jersey barriers and the like, we also have some requirements and standards to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1463.657s">maintain,</a> keep, and improve our curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1465.522s">So</a> that's the intention behind this resolution and I ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1657.919s">I</a> would like to commend the administration, Mr. President, on getting the emergency outdoor dining licenses up and running in relatively fast order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1666.646s">When</a> the governor issued his executive order allowing outdoor dining licenses to be issued under the emergency order, the administration embraced it and ran with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1674.071s">So,</a> you know, it's not to be critical of the job that they've done at all because they've done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1679.155s">It's</a> just a suggestion as to how we can improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=1681.657s">So</a> I appreciate the work that they've done.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2003.411s">Rick</a> looks like he's on the beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2005.273s">He's</a> got the picture of the beach with the rocks in the ocean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2007.913s">I</a> got him.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2075.012s">With</a> all due respect to the commentary around ADA compliance, that's the standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2080.194s">That</a> should be happening regardless of what's going on in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2084.394s">I</a> think that it might be important for us if we do have some locations or sites in the city that we ask our ADA compliance officer, the director of diversity to go down there and check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2093.107s">You</a> know, it certainly won't take anything away from the resolution, so I have no problem with you putting it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2097.351s">But</a> the sole principle and purpose was for us to, you know, create some standards and beautification standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2104.877s">ADA</a> compliance is always an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2106.438s">It's</a> always something that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2107.839s">It's</a> always something that we should be focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2109.42s">So</a> I have no problem amending the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2112.403s">However,</a> I don't want it to detract from the principal goal and objective.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2187.341s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2189.202s">Accessory</a> use dwelling is a self-contained apartment in a single family homeless owner occupied attached <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2197.71s">or</a> in a separate structure on the same lot of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2200.712s">Many</a> times these are referred to as in-law apartments or granny flats is another term that I've seen raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2209.699s">But</a> what accessory dwelling units will allow us to do is to create more affordable housing stock in our community and more housing stock in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2218.806s">We</a> hear a lot about people that are being overhoused, people that are single living in a two, three or four bedroom home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2225.46s">But</a> because there's a lack of stock and a lack of affordable stock, especially, there are many downsides. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2232.104s">So</a> Mr. President, looking at what's going on in our community, the cry for more affordable housing and more housing stock in the greater Boston area, and the fact that studies would show that by allowing accessory dwelling units, assessments go up anywhere between <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2250.178s">25</a> to 34% in communities that allow accessory dwelling units in terms of property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2254.522s">I</a> think it's something that's very worthy of review, examination and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2261.147s">Previously,</a> the city of Medford did allow accessory dwelling units and they allowed them well before any of our time, well before Mr. Moki's time through what was called the restrictive covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2272.036s">And</a> that restrictive covenant was filed at the registry of deeds saying that when this parcel changed hands, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2277.636s">that</a> the accessory dwelling unit, which would have a kitchen and a bathroom in it, the kitchen would be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2281.858s">It</a> would not be sold as a multifamily dwelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2284.52s">So</a> that's something we can also take a look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2287.561s">Obviously,</a> the restrictive covenant became something that became difficult to enforce, and that's why it fell by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2292.404s">So</a> that may not be the best way to move about it, but it is an option for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2296.286s">So</a> with that being said, I think that it would make sense for the building commissioner and the city solicitor to provide us with a draft for us to debate, deliberate, and hopefully discuss with Mr. Bob Roski. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2307.919s">I've</a> had the opportunity of speaking with Andrew a little about this from our community development board at great lengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2313.801s">Andrew</a> is an expert in smart growth and accessory dwelling, accessory use dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2319.422s">So,</a> you know, he provides us with a vast array of expertise and knowledge in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2323.844s">And</a> I think that this is something that the community development board would be excited to work with us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2329.165s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2332.426s">And,</a> you know, when we talk about accessories dwellings, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2336.402s">an</a> apartment above a garage, Mr. President, or a small home in a backyard, you know, with the setbacks and zoning allows for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2344.408s">So</a> I think that that's, you know, a backyard cottage, something like that, a basement apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2348.391s">But</a> just the housing options for people, you know, you know, someone who has aging parents, you know, I think that an accessory dwelling unit will be great for someone in my situation where I have a wife, young kids and an aging father who has his independence, but I would like to have him closer to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2363.482s">You</a> know, so those are just some things that we need to talk about and discuss, especially when we look at the city of Medford, the desire for us all to age in place and the opportunities and options that are out there and the limits that are surrounding them at this point in time, I think make this a good measure to pursue and to take a look at Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2384.026s">So</a> with that being said, I rest my case and I'll ask my council colleagues to support the endeavor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2431.452s">Mr.</a> President in light of, um, in light of the events that have transpired over the past, uh, since January now, eight months, nine months, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2450.769s">the</a> number of ordinances that we've requested to be drafted and the number of ordinances that have come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2454.972s">I</a> think it might be worthwhile for us to schedule a committee of the whole with representatives from the solicitor's office and the city solicitor to get an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2463.979s">I</a> filed the resolution maybe 90 days ago seeking for monthly updates as to where we are in the status of the requested draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2471.45s">And</a> that's something that I think that we should pursue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2474.191s">We</a> haven't gotten an update on the status of any of our draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2477.251s">So</a> it might make sense for us to call a committee of the whole so we can be brought up to speed as to where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2481.772s">That's</a> the council work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2483.733s">I</a> certainly support Councilor Behr's resolution, but I think that it might make more sense for us instead of to get a report back, but to actually have a meeting and get all get in the same room where we can talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=2493.395s">So</a> that would be the only request that I make is that he just changed the language in his amendment to require a committee of the whole as opposed to report back from the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3066.348s">Um,</a> no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3068.348s">I</a> said that there was a restricted covenant on prior prior permitting of these was allowed through a restrictive covenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3074.509s">And</a> when the property changed hands, the kitchen would have to be taken out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3102.4s">Well,</a> I mean, the basic economic principle of supply and demand would drive the housing costs down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3109.462s">So,</a> you know, it may not be an affordable housing unit per se by the definition of, you know, an affordable housing unit under Department of Housing and Community Development guidelines, but what it would do is make housing more affordable because our stock would increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3123.307s">So</a> if the supply exceeds the demand, the cost goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3127.089s">If</a> the demand exceeds the supply, the cost goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3129.27s">So</a> just the basic economic principle of supply and demand, the more housing units we have on the market, the cheaper that those units are going to be.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3148.39s">The</a> principle of the accessory use dwelling unit is it's usually a single-family owner-occupied home, right, defined by Massachusetts General Law, a single-family owner-occupied home. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3162.409s">So</a> it's not, you know, this isn't something where it's going to be, you know, I'm just throwing apartments up all over the place so tough kids can live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3168.59s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3169.25s">This</a> is to meet a need and a demand in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3389.345s">This</a> is in no way, shape, or form was a proposal to have these as inclusionary zoning housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3398.171s">It</a> was just to allow for <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3400.525s">The</a> ability to permit for an accessory unit to create more housing stock in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3406.567s">And</a> when I think we're all getting hung up on this affordable affordable affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3411.008s">This</a> isn't the proposal that's going to be required to be affordable housing, the affordability is going to lie in the supply and demand with the increase in supply. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3420.276s">we're</a> gonna be able to drive the cost of housing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3423.261s">That's</a> where the affordability comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3425.004s">Making</a> it more affordable would probably be the best way to put it, but not affordable housing, making housing more affordable, as opposed to increasing our affordable housing stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3433.988s">These</a> accessory dwelling units in the stock that's going to come with them are not going to be attributable to our 10% threshold under the Department of Housing and Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3442.211s">So</a> I want that to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3444.572s">The</a> affordability aspect comes into it by increasing the number of units in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3451.115s">We're</a> going to hopefully catch up and then at some point meet or exceed our demand so that this cost will continue to drive down. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3459.851s">So</a> I don't want us to get hung up on this affordable housing, affordable housing, like it's something that's gonna go towards a safe habit threshold, because that's not the intention of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3469.218s">The</a> intention of this is to allow people the opportunity to pursue an ability to create in-law apartments and owner-occupied dwellings that are single-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3479.106s">So</a> that's where this is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=3480.187s">I</a> want that to be very clear.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4195.363s">approval</a> on the motion of vice president caviello's second of i that's what bears consulate night uh mr president we could just have an explanation from somebody in the administration as to where these funds are going to go when they are re-injected into our school department's budget i'd appreciate that um i know that you know <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4217.747s">When</a> we were going through the budget process, there were a number of decisions that were not filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4222.808s">There</a> was the hope that we would be going to be able to recall, I think another 30 or 40 employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4227.529s">So</a> I think an update would be worthwhile and sufficient at this point in time as to how these funds are going to be expended in the spirit of Council of Business Resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4235.71s">I</a> know we have some representatives from the administration here, as well as some representatives from the teachers union that are here this evening as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4264.5s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4270.765s">So</a> is it safe to say at this point in time that the school committee is waiting for us to give them their money so that they can figure out how they want to spend it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4279.525s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4280.245s">More</a> for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4761.36s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4763.095s">Um,</a> so we have two papers before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4765.516s">The</a> one that we're speaking of right now is for the $703,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4767.357s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4767.718s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4768.338s">So</a> that is what would have been the savings on the science lab projects through our, um, uh, bond or a bond dissipation notes or whatever it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4778.683s">However,</a> we were able to save money on that project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4782.033s">And</a> now what we're doing is we're gonna take that $703,000 and because we had appropriated that previously for school department capital improvements, we're going to repurpose these for continued school department capital improvements?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4796.52s">And</a> then of this $703,000, 112,000 of that is going to be directed towards the HEAC improvements? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4800.162s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4800.282s">Or</a> is that above and beyond?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4827.875s">Okay,</a> so what was the total surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4832.197s">Was</a> it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4855.161s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4855.781s">So</a> now when we're looking at the money that's come in over the past couple of weeks, we have about $1.9 million in funds that have been injected into our unrestricted government and chapter 70 money.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4869.427s">And</a> we had a $5.5 million deficit right around January 30th, June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4874.97s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4875.65s">That</a> brings us to about $3.6 million in deficit, restructural deficit right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4881.033s">Then</a> we have these two papers that's about another million dollars that we're going to be able to invest it back into our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4886.135s">So</a> we're looking at having a deficit of about $2.6 million as of right now, compared to where we were June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4892.998s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4893.778s">We've</a> almost cut the deficit in half over the past 45 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4900.967s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=4901.527s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5216.891s">I</a> got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5217.772s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5219.392s">Just</a> a couple of questions for the finance director, through you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5223.734s">If</a> we fail to reprogram these funds, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5226.816s">Does</a> it just revert back to the general fund?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5231.976s">they</a> just sit back in the capital project account. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5234.158s">And</a> by us repurposing or reprogramming these funds, would they be subject to appropriation in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5239.903s">Or</a> is this a blank check? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5240.984s">We're</a> giving a $900,000 blank check to the school department for the capital fund without them having to come back to us and request appropriation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5259.71s">and</a> what's the purpose that we'd be voting now?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5265.234s">It's</a> the Medford High School Improvements Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5266.915s">So</a> what we're doing right now is making a commitment of about $900,000 to invest in improvements just to Medford High School through the passage of this?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5276.042s">If</a> we do this, it would not be subject to appropriation? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5280.285s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5281.206s">And</a> if we don't do it, it would sit in the same account that it's in and would be able to appropriate that money at a later date? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5288.969s">Yes,</a> I request. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5290.87s">Okay,</a> so really, really what this is almost was setting up a revolving account almost for Medford High School school improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5298.094s">That's</a> going to be funded through the surplus that we saved on these bonds.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5316.864s">And</a> do we know <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5319.142s">how</a> we're going to prioritize. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5320.863s">I</a> think this is similar to what Councilor Scarpelli and Max are talking about, but what are we going to prioritize in terms of where the spending is going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5327.486s">I</a> think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5330.547s">Without</a> appropriation, then, you know, where that spending goes is going to be very important.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5350.903s">All</a> right, thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5515.645s">Mr.</a> President, thank you and through you to the finance director. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5520.046s">Also,</a> what I heard was that the funds would have to be used only for Medford High School if we appropriated these funds and put them in this account?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5537.791s">So</a> as it's written right now, if the money stayed in the accounts that they were in, they were subject to appropriation, those funds could be used district wide? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5545.641s">versus</a> just at that exclusive school?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5570.758s">Wouldn't</a> it make more sense for the school committee to come and talk to us when they want us to spend the money versus us giving them the money and then saying, tell us where you're going to spend it later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5582.021s">That's</a> just food for thought, but I'm going to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5583.721s">I</a> appreciate you clarifying that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5969.118s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5969.958s">I</a> think it's also important to ask the question, how long have these surplus funds remained in that account? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5975.919s">Because</a> if I recollect, I'm thinking that the science labs were probably completed in 2014 or 15.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5987.082s">So</a> were those funds in that account <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=5989.47s">since</a> that time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6008.759s">And</a> this isn't a critique of the job you're doing, because I think you're doing a wonderful job, Miss Nunley. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6014.142s">But</a> you know, as the check and balance on <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6019.738s">The</a> corner office is the check and balance on spending here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6023.979s">And</a> as the body responsible to make fiscally responsible decisions, I think it's important that we have an understanding where these funds are going to be spent and when they're going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6034.402s">And</a> I'm a little uncomfortable writing a blank check and not knowing where those funds are going to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6042.865s">So</a> for that reason, I would support Councilor Mark's motion <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6046.683s">that</a> we lay these matters on the table until such time as we can receive correspondence from the school committee as to where they intend to spend these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6053.347s">I</a> have all the confidence and faith in the world and John McLaughlin, I think he's done an excellent job since he's been appointed the facilities managers for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6060.271s">And</a> I know that these monies will not be wasted. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6062.932s">However,</a> we have a job to do here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6065.193s">And</a> that's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6067.092s">provide</a> a check and balance on the spending and the buck stops here. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6070.334s">And</a> I don't think it's appropriate for us to write a check for 800 and some $1,000 and not know where that money is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6076.419s">So</a> for those reasons, I'll be supporting Councilor Mark's resolution to amend the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6201.58s">apparently.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6202.501s">Councilor</a> Marks, you said- It was a motion that was made and seconded and debate continued, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6464.763s">Just</a> to be clear, the councilor's motion is to ask for the chairman to make a ruling as to whether or not this paper is out of order?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6476.05s">So</a> am I- The original paper that we sent to the administration was to get an opinion as to what the policy was, wasn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6481.754s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6502.252s">So</a> are you making the ruling on the motion now, or are you reading the paper into the record?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6516.446s">Okay,</a> so then what we'll do is read the paper into the record and then we'll address the council's motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6697.281s">So</a> what about the Councilor's point of order? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6700.984s">Councilor</a> Caraviello made a point of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6702.446s">He</a> asked for a ruling on the decorum and appropriateness of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6708.411s">So</a> you're making a ruling and determining that the paper is not out of order and that it's appropriate?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6713.455s">I</a> question the ruling of the Chair.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6810.312s">So</a> they, so they, so that the calendar wrote, um, yeah, so the papers were a lot of water and, uh, that's it, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6901.722s">I</a> certainly can appreciate the spirit of the resolution that's been brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6906.284s">However,</a> based upon my background in organized labor and representing police unions in the past, this is something that may strike a concern relative to collective bargaining rights, collective bargaining agreements and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6920.964s">So</a> with that being said, I'll be voting in opposition of this resolution this evening, just because I don't have enough knowledge understanding as to what the collective bargaining agreement says between the Metro Police Performance Association in the city relative to construction details and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6935.838s">I</a> certainly believe that public safety comes first and public safety is our number one job. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6939.782s">But</a> with that being said, I also don't want to <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6941.683s">tread</a> on water that's something that's outside our purview and subject to the mandatory requirements of collective bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6947.125s">So</a> for those reasons, I'll be voting against this paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=6961.629s">I</a> might be more comfortable supporting it after I hear from him then, Mr. President, but thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7249.698s">So</a> from what I'm taking back from this, Mr. McGilvrey, through the president to you, is that this would require legislative action by the city council to pass a home rule petition and then get that up to Beacon Hill in order for this to become a reality?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7279.278s">Like</a> a million bucks, I can hear you perfectly fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7284.361s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7284.501s">Okay,</a> so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7287.683s">Okay,</a> but it would require some, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7290.829s">Bargaining</a> at some I mean if the home rule petition passes it would supersede to collect a bargaining agreement But right now your contract would only allow for sworn officers to perform details correct, we would Yeah, correct, we would we would It wouldn't supersede our CBA.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7309.68s">I</a> meant to get Yeah, okay and <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7314.195s">Right</a> now, when details go unfilled, are there any other entities or bodies that are eligible to participate if a traffic detail's not filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7323.138s">Do</a> surrounding communities come and help out in MedFed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7325.118s">Does</a> the Sheriff's Department come and help out in MedFed? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7327.119s">Are</a> there other entities that are helping out now that, you know, help them perform some of these tasks and duties?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7398.438s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7400.119s">Mr.</a> President, if I could amend the paper to request that the city administration provide us with a draft copy of the homework petition that's been presented, I think that would be helpful in us as we start to kick off this discussion because it does sound like a win-win if the collective bargaining agreement in the union's willing to be flexible and work with the community to provide this service, then I'm all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=7421.71s">I'd</a> like to offer that in the form of an amendment that the draft homework petition be provided to the council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8082.706s">I</a> do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, there's a lot of talk about the library and about whether or not we needed a library and whether or not we needed a library that was this much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8091.851s">If</a> we were going to refurbish the existing library that we had, it would probably cost us more money than we're spending on what we have to raise and what we have to appropriate through taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8103.298s">With</a> the grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8105.422s">and</a> the money that we have to appropriate, we're getting a library that's going to be state of the art. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8109.045s">And</a> I'm so excited about this and I'm very happy to see that Mr. Bloomberg was able and willing to step forward and donate some of his hard-earned money back to his hometown for our library. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8120.555s">And</a> I think it's also important that, you know, we recognize the work that Councilor Caraviello and his colleagues on the library fundraising committee have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8128.877s">Um,</a> this has been something that didn't happen overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8131.158s">It's</a> something that happened, you know, over years and years and years of hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8135.218s">Um,</a> you know, the City Council, uh, fought to be sure that our library was funded at an appropriate level that would make us eligible for this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8142.64s">And,</a> uh, Councilor Caraviello has shown great leadership on this issue and this is going to be a long-lasting legacy, uh, for him and his family long after he's gone when they get to look at that building and see it up there and know that he had such, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8152.842s">such</a> an instrumental role in making it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8154.403s">So</a> Rick, thank you for everything you've done and thank you to your team because it's a really exciting time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8165.588s">We're</a> in the corner, you know, we're coming close to the finish line and there's been a lot of questions about the financial uncertainty in the library and this announcement really sets me at ease and it makes me hopeful that we'll be able to raise, if not <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8180.082s">enough</a> to fund the rest of it, but even more for maybe a preventative maintenance account. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8184.685s">So</a> with that being said, with Ryu, Mr. President, the Vice President and his team over at the library, thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8241.125s">I</a> also think it's important, Mr. President, I did forget to reference the hard work that our state delegation has put into also being sure that we're getting this grant and making sure that the grant remains funded and stays online. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8253.719s">You</a> know, Representative Donato continues to deliver week in and week out for the city of Medford and Representative Bob has done the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8260.278s">especially</a> when it comes to this library. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8261.841s">So</a> I think we're very fortunate to have them as well, Representative Gobley and all the work that they've done in maintaining a commitment to ensure that we maintain the funding level that this grant <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8273.063s">you</a> know, the grand commitment was at the beginning before the COVID-19 and the fiscal crisis that struck us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8278.266s">So</a> I think it's also important that we look at the work that our state delegation does. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8283.249s">There's</a> a term, it takes a village. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8284.951s">And,</a> you know, this is the perfect example of the city and the state government working together to deliver for the taxpayers here in the communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=8295.916s">representative</a> Bob and representative gobbledy, as well as Senator Jalen, and making sure that the funding mechanisms remain in place so that we can continue to thrive and move forward in the project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9321.699s">I</a> appreciate Councilor Bears bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9325.661s">There</a> was a part of it when I read that I was a little concerned about, it was about how we're going to disseminate information relative to how this is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9333.726s">And</a> he provided us with some solutions, a robocall, some social media, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9338.188s">I</a> have no problem with this type of outreach, Mr. President, especially based upon the circumstances that are going on at the federal level relative to census count, post office and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9347.414s">So</a> with that being said, I support the resolution a lot.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9354.156s">I</a> will second it for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9782.846s">This</a> is a matter of public participation, Mr. President, not a petition, not a resolution, not a resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=9787.509s">I</a> don't think it's going to be subject to that rule in my personal opinion as the chair.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10066.281s">About</a> 30 days have passed since we made the request, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10069.223s">Since</a> 2017, when the demolition delay ordinance was changed, granting an 18-month demolition delay, how many homes have been determined to be historically, culturally, or politically significant and have been restored? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10085.456s">We</a> still haven't gotten that information, so I'd like to reiterate that request, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10091.35s">But</a> you know what, this is a public participation paper, and I don't want to get into open meeting law violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10095.631s">I</a> won't offer that in the form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10097.492s">What</a> I'll do is I'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting, provided that my council colleagues have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10102.193s">It's</a> an update item, it's an update issue, and we haven't received an update on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10105.033s">So</a> I'll revisit this, Mr. President, when appropriate, but I do feel as though this is information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10112.455s">I</a> also think it's going to be very important for us to take a look at the, they have an annual report. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10120.338s">The</a> historic commission has to file an annual report with the administration, with the mayor, pursuant to, I believe, chapter 48 of our local ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10127.343s">And</a> I'd be very interested to see what those documents say. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10130.565s">Mr.</a> President may be going back to 2017 or 2016 when we made the ordinance change. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10135.889s">And</a> I'd also like to see those maybe published on the internet so that we have an open and transparent process for individuals to have the opportunity to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10144.274s">I</a> know that those words were very big during the campaign for mayor, and I hope that they still hold true to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10150.278s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10153.359s">I</a> share a lot of the concerns that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10155.92s">Catalo</a> has brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10157.62s">I</a> share a lot of concerns about what's going on when it comes to development here in the community and when it comes to, you know, boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10167.203s">exceeding</a> their authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10168.704s">Um,</a> so with that being said, I think this is an issue that does need further investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10172.206s">That's</a> why I voted for it previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10174.448s">Um,</a> but I can certainly understand where Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10176.389s">Catalo</a> is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10177.85s">And</a> I think it's also important to point out, um, the reliance that the city has on the issuance of building permits, new growth in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10190.283s">Those</a> are two very important items that come into play when it comes to municipal finance and our ability to be sustainable and to meet our financial obligations going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10198.532s">So</a> those are things that we need to think about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10201.055s">With</a> that being said, I rest my case and I thank the petitioner for bringing the matter forward this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10404.39s">That's</a> not the role of the historical commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10407.131s">The</a> role of the historical commission is to determine whether or not a property has political, cultural, or historical significance in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10413.153s">That's</a> what their role is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10414.133s">The</a> building department's job is to stop abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10417.894s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10418.834s">And</a> we brought it to their attention and now they're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10421.272s">Councilor,</a> I agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10422.473s">It's</a> my understanding that the building department is responding to changes that the Historical Commission has made to their procedures and processes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10432.258s">Relative</a> to the adoption of some standard relative to the National Wildlife Service or something like that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10439.102s">That</a> is not actually correct at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10441.264s">That's</a> the conversation that we had last meeting, and that was what seemed to be affirmed by both Mr. Mulkey and the chairman of the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10448.513s">Which</a> standard did you say the commission put in front of those? <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10451.234s">Some</a> wildlife thing about log cabins in the woods for national parks or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10456.256s">No,</a> Councilor, you're just inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10459.057s">That's</a> factually inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10462.138s">You</a> know, that was what was portrayed to us anyway at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10466.46s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this is a petition for public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10470.442s">It</a> doesn't warrant a vote, receiving a place on file or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10474.523s">The</a> petitioners made their case, so with that being <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10477.618s">I</a> certainly have nothing to add further and I look forward to a committee of the whole.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10506.934s">I</a> do hope that the gentleman is not saying that I'm lying when surrounding the term truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10514.037s">I</a> just wanted that to be very clear that I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10516.714s">representing</a> what I heard at the last meeting, I'm not making anything up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10521.277s">And</a> I think that when I heard the term truth, it kind of broke up there, but I wanted to be sure that I wasn't being called someone that was portraying facts that were different than what happened at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10531.384s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I trust that the council wasn't attacking me personally on that or calling me a liar. <a href="https://youtu.be/qIvMl_-GSJQ&t=10537.928s">And</a> I think it might make sense for all of us to be in the same room to discuss this issue as we voted on last meeting.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ/2024-11-19_XL6CFVX_DxQ.html">City Council 07-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1218.451s">This</a> is a public hearing in favor or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1221.835s">It</a> should be ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1222.676s">We</a> have 35 items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1224.297s">If</a> we allow the dialogue to continue for four or five minutes on every item on the agenda this evening, we're going to be here until tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1231.985s">I</a> appreciate what Mr. Anderson has to say and I agree with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1234.167s">I'm</a> not going to be supporting the zoning amendment this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1236.129s">I'm</a> going to vote to reject it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1237.675s">for</a> the reasons that I stated when it was introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1240.096s">However,</a> in the interest of getting through the agenda, Mr. President, I think it might be important for us to maybe limit the time of public participation this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1247.781s">We</a> have 35 items on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1290.953s">Motion</a> to close the public air.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1342.756s">Was</a> that opposed, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1345.536s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1368.84s">Motion</a> to reject the zoning amendment, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1540.021s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1763.474s">Yeah,</a> so I'm following a meeting of the Committee of the Whole.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1770.035s">I</a> would assume that can be done between now and our next regularly scheduled meeting, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1783.2s">Or</a> representative thereof, whoever wants to go over these changes, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1839.963s">I</a> would move to name the date as the next regularly scheduled city council meeting, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1888.556s">Or</a> you can add it as part of the main motion, so we don't have to vote on it twice.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1898.683s">As</a> amended by Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=1927.607s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2590.375s">Mr.</a> President, this is the public hearing portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2592.096s">It's</a> either opposed or against, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2725.546s">This</a> is a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2726.647s">It's</a> either we're in opposition or we're in favor of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2730.369s">We</a> go, again, I understand we're coming from Marion, but we have 35 items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2734.492s">If</a> we continue down this road, we're going to be here all evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2737.293s">The</a> common practice that's always been with the council has been public hearing in favor or opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2742.116s">When</a> we've had people come to the podium in the council meetings, we've told them, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2744.878s">Stop,</a> public hearing in favor or opposed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2802.45s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe granted locations and personal property tax are attached to any type of grant location in the underground infrastructure that they put in through the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2811.693s">And</a> I do believe that that itemization is determined after they complete the work and construct what it is that they need to construct so that we can tax it appropriately.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2966.656s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe Councilor Scarpelli has a question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2971.758s">He's</a> muted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2976.16s">Good</a> luck.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3506.468s">Mr.</a> President, I do think it's important to point out that this measure has been recommended by the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3511.689s">And</a> as part of the Eversource project, I do believe that that area will be resurfaced curb to curb on the completion of the Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3520.091s">So</a> I think that's something that's important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3522.452s">If</a> in fact there is any disruption or trenching that's done in that area, come completion of the Eversource project, it will be resurfaced curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3529.393s">I</a> can certainly confidently vote for this paper this evening in approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3533.298s">However,</a> I would defer to the rest of the council as to what direction they want to take, whether they want to receive them at a table of matter or a table of matter until the applicant comes back is fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3542.18s">That's</a> been a normal practice in the past, but I'm comfortable voting on it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=3545.461s">I</a> wish you good luck.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4080.49s">Mr.</a> President, I find this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4084.853s">What</a> I'm asking for is a committee of the whole meeting with the administration and representatives of the fire department and the fire union to discuss the future of our fire headquarters, fire training tower, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4096.441s">We've</a> had many discussions over the past three or four years relative to these projects, and many commitments were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4103.085s">And</a> I just would like to see where we stand in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4106.948s">I</a> know we face very trying and scary financial <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4110.475s">times</a> right now, the picture isn't beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4113.116s">However,</a> I think it's important that we maintain some of the commitments that we made, and at the very least communicate with friends of the fire department as to where we stand, what's going on, and what commitments still remain on the table moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4124.603s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4127.784s">This</a> is really just an effort to get more information, to find out where we are from a capital planning standpoint related to fire safety services, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4220.454s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this is just a resolution providing a directive to the city clerk to forward us certain informations that come to his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4228.699s">All</a> too often, as a city councilor, you know, when you're down at CB Scoops getting an ice cream, someone will come up to you and say, hey, what's going on at this address or this location? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4237.183s">You</a> say, what are you talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4238.244s">I</a> have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4238.964s">And</a> they say, well, there's doing construction over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4240.705s">What's</a> the story? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4242.166s">Well,</a> I've never received a paper on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4245.448s">Pursuant</a> to the way that projects are filed through site plan review, they have to be submitted to the clerk's office, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4250.35s">So</a> what this is is just directing the city clerk when any item that's subject to site plan review comes across his desk to include it in our council packets so that we're aware of it and then we can do our due diligence to be well informed about the certain projects that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4263.116s">So</a> what this is is asking the city clerk to provide us with information <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4266.176s">The</a> city clerk was never directed to do this in the past, so what we're doing is just taking a step to ensure that we receive this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4272.641s">I</a> think Adam's doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4274.062s">This</a> is no reflection on the work that he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4276.724s">This</a> is a new responsibility that we're tasking upon him, like we do probably every other week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4280.987s">We</a> give him something else to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4282.848s">I</a> think pretty soon we'll have to look at giving this guy a raise or some more vacation time, Mr. President, if he's able to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4288.753s">being</a> said, this is just an opportunity for us to gain information and gain certain documents related to projects that are being performed in our community that are subject to the site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4298.582s">Those</a> are the same projects that are also subject to our inclusionary housing ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4303.806s">So</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we're aware of that before the shovel goes in the ground.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4370.08s">Resolution</a> does nothing to change the existing ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4372.362s">It</a> does nothing to change the approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4374.224s">All</a> it does is allow us to be informed with documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4377.687s">It's</a> really a request for public records that's an ongoing request for public records that when they come into the clerk's office, we get a copy of it, but it's not doing anything to change the existing ordinance or the existing approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4389.857s">That's</a> not the intent of this piece of legislation, and it's not something I'm willing to amend to reach that fire at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4490.263s">I'd</a> offer a motion to sever.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4496.766s">I</a> don't want it to be any paper, but the councilor is adding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4498.707s">So</a> I'm asking that it be severed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4551.856s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4609.436s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, it's been brought to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4611.237s">I</a> think it's been brought to all of our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4613.037s">All</a> of us in the community are well aware that a series of unfortunate events occurred on the night of July 4th down along Willis and Conger Street, I do believe, Mr. President, where there was an assault on police officers, shooting of fireworks, throwing of M-80s, quarter sticks of dynamite at our police officers under their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4634.223s">Just</a> a scene of unrest. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4637.137s">in</a> violence, Mr. President, against our police department, against members of our public safety community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4642.62s">Our</a> fire department, our police department, we're on the scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4645.702s">So</a> I'd just like to get a report, Mr. President, because unlike some people in this community that feel as though Facebook is the gospel of news, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4653.285s">I</a> feel as though if we're going to find out what's going on in this community, we should get official reports from the people in the department heads that are responsible for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4659.392s">So</a> with that being said, I'm bringing this initiative forward so I can have a better understanding of what happened down there, Mr. President, because I really don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4665.393s">The</a> information that I've received about this has all been from media outlets and fake news outlets. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4670.914s">So</a> with that being said, I'm hoping that we can get a report directly from our chief of police.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4726.71s">But</a> as of right now, the issue that's before this council is the issues and events that happened on the evening of July 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4732.174s">And</a> I would move for approval on that paper, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4847.504s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4849.086s">For</a> those of us that have been around the community, we're all well aware of the Honeycutt family and the contributions that they've made to MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4855.631s">We</a> look at Bill Honeycutt and the work that he does with John Brewer's Tavern and the volunteerism and the donations that he makes to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4864.139s">We</a> look at Steve Honeycutt and the work that he did on the Disability Commission before his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4868.563s">And</a> here we have <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4870.856s">Mrs.</a> Honeycutt, who recently passed away, who's done such a great job raising children that had such a focus on community and such a focus on giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4879.039s">It's</a> just very sad to see her leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4880.42s">She</a> was an integral part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4882.52s">She</a> did great work raising her children, and she's raised them to be great participants in social capital and the social fabric I mentioned, Mr. President, and she will surely be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4890.883s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in expressing deepest condolences and sincere condolences to the Honeycutt family in their time of loss.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4974.725s">I</a> second the motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4980.447s">I</a> second the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5068.967s">Mr.</a> President, it's my understanding that this issue has been resolved, that Arlington Catholic has decided to take their business elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5075.891s">However,</a> I do find it quite unfortunate the series of events and circumstances that led up to Arlington Catholic having to go somewhere else to hold their graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5085.197s">The</a> O'Melle Commission granted a permit, Arlington Catholic wrote a check, and they were unable to hold their graduation due to concerns around COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5096.078s">However,</a> at the same time, Medford High School, who has a class that's twice the size, is holding graduation ceremonies at Homel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5104.642s">So</a> for the interest of just fairness, Mr. President, I don't understand why this happened or how this happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5110.605s">I</a> just find it unfortunate that the number of children that graduated from Island and Catholic that have Medford roots or are Medford residents are probably up to 30% or 40% of the senior class. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5121.67s">And</a> to have them want to hold their ceremonies here in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5124.932s">This</a> shows what a great relationship we have with Huntington Catholic and the amount of people in this community that believe in faith-based education and that send their children to Huntington Catholic but also remain members of our community that contribute quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5141.078s">So</a> I just found that unfortunate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5142.619s">It's</a> about the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5144.06s">And</a> I'd like to get a report back from the city, but after filing this resolution and after the agenda was published, I did receive a lengthy response from the chief of staff that I admittedly glanced over and haven't had the opportunity to really get into and to read, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5159.869s">So</a> I will be offering to receive and place this paper on file until I can perform my due diligence and read the report that Chief of Staff Rodriguez forwarded to my email account and all of ours earlier in the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5171.476s">But</a> with that being said, I do find it unfortunate that, you know, things had to turn out this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5177.547s">And</a> I think that, you know, as the months and days go by, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5183.223s">we</a> need to come to grips with what's going on in the world, but also what's going on in this community and how we can continue to better provide services under whatever they want to call this new normal or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5194.088s">I</a> don't think there's anything normal about it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5195.969s">I</a> think it's craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5197.97s">You</a> can go into Target, but you can't go into City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5201.492s">You</a> got to wait in line to go in City Hall, but you can't go into Target. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5204.614s">It's</a> getting nutty. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5206.715s">I</a> think that it's time that we figure out what course we're going to take, what direction we're going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5211.633s">get</a> a game plan together and let's stick to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5213.835s">I</a> know that there's a lot of uncertainty, there's a lot of dynamic pieces and moving pieces and moving parts, Mr. President, but for us to not be able to provide for those families and those kids a graduation ceremony after all that they've had to put up with since St. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5228.246s">Patrick's</a> Day is a little bit unfortunate and I would have liked to see it handled a little bit differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5233.13s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I will take the time <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5242.879s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I will offer to receive and place this item on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5247.521s">However,</a> there was a lot of concern about it that was brought up over the last several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5251.402s">So</a> I felt it was warranted to place it on the agenda this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5583.013s">Will</a> the resurfacing be done in a curb-to-curb fashion, or is this going to be grounded inlay in a trench?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5616.843s">The</a> chief of state will have a comment on that as to what the street restoration plan would be for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5622.865s">Dave,</a> do you have any idea around Mr. Rodriguez?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5636.644s">Excellent,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5637.305s">No,</a> it's just, it's always been a common question we've always asked about, you know, ground opening permits and restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5643.709s">And</a> when, you know, our roads get reopened, what happens is we get a trench and the trench ends up being garbage in 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5649.933s">And</a> you know, the contractor is supposed to come back and let it sit for six months and replace it, then it'll be good as new, but that never happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5657.499s">So</a> we've been pushing for curb to curb restoration on projects like this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5663.483s">Yeah,</a> Mr. Fleming, I'm just, I'm explaining to the Comcast petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5666.85s">and</a> why I ask, you know, but I understand, you know, the need for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5671.272s">I</a> don't like why they ask this here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5672.913s">And</a> I apologize for interrupting, but I just figured it would be easier to ask the question while it was on the table, as opposed to going back to it after you're finished voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5679.076s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5877.552s">I</a> just would recommend, Mr. President, that if night work is going to be discussed, we take the appropriate steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5882.135s">We</a> do have two senior buildings right across the street from that location, and we don't want to disrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5887.355s">that</a> elderly population that live in our senior buildings, if in fact we can avoid that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5892.22s">So</a> I certainly appreciate Councilor Mark's position on this and I too will support the paper this evening and await the report of the city engineer relative to the curb-to-curb repayment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5940.255s">It</a> is pretty much curb to curb because it's going across the street.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5944.917s">Mr.</a> Rodriguez, that's plenty. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5947.699s">I'm</a> no engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5948.359s">So</a> any other information you give me that you want me to read, I'm not going to understand anyway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5957.264s">Sounds</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5957.604s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5957.864s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=5958.365s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7228.382s">But</a> I think just a few years ago, the only changes that we made to the demolition delay ordinance was homes that were constructed within 75 years and expanding the demolition delay from six months to 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7239.187s">But</a> the legislative body made no other changes other than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7243.209s">So</a> that's what I think is <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7244.642s">making</a> this confusing to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7246.642s">You</a> know, when we made those changes to the demolition delay ordinance, that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7251.703s">It</a> was just those two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7252.803s">It</a> wasn't this broad sweep to say, you know, start changing the way that you practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7257.664s">I</a> think that that's what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7259.585s">But</a> I just wanted to correct what you said there, that when we changed the demolition delay ordinance, all we did was change from houses built before 1900 to houses built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7272.91s">expanding</a> the demolition delay period from six months to 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7276.791s">So</a> I think that's very important that we point that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7278.772s">There's</a> been no passage of an ordinance that changed anything that we did here, other than the amount of time that the demolition delay was in place and the age of the home that was subject to demolition delay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7433.393s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7435.013s">So</a> it's my understanding that under the current application that the <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7440.03s">historic</a> commission is using for a demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7442.431s">If</a> someone wanted to change the windows out on their home, maybe move them six inches to the left, six inches to the right, they'd have to go before the historical commission in order to get an approval to do that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7487.36s">Let</a> me ask you, if someone came today to your office and said, I want a permit to not take these windows out, blow them out and put a huge picture window in, would they be allowed to get that permit or would they have to go to the historical commission?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7609.687s">Mr.</a> Moki, through the president, Mr. Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7614.111s">Underneath</a> the new standards that are trying to be implemented now, interior work would also have to be, certain interior work would also need to have to be approved by the historic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7622.777s">Am</a> I understanding that correctly?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7645.489s">So</a> in essence, if somebody wanted to make their house handicap accessible after a tragic event that happened in their family, they'd have to go before the historic commission to make the house handicap accessible as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7654.156s">A</a> circumstance could arise in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7656.418s">It</a> could potentially arise, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7659.661s">Somebody</a> wanted to rip down a deck and put a ramp in, move a door so that they can meet the requirements of making a wheelchair pass through, they'd have to be subject to these requirements?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7688.125s">And</a> is this commonplace in other communities that the Historical Commission goes this far and gets this far involved in building and development?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7703.768s">And</a> also, Mr. Mochi, can you answer, or maybe we'll offer this as a B paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7708.712s">I</a> know you can't answer off the top of your head, but can we get a report back from the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7714.197s">Since</a> amending the demolition delay ordinance, how many homes that have been subject to demolition delay have actually been restored to the historic state? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7727.409s">Because</a> I mean, we have an operative ordinance in there, but if it's not meeting the objectives, and now it's turning into this second layer of a building department, I don't know if that's good public policy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7737.076s">If</a> we haven't saved any houses or restored any houses, and all this is doing is creating another layer of bureaucracy and another layer of government, the government within a government, for individuals to get permitting to make home improvements on the largest purchase that they make in their life, their kingdom, their castle, their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7755.595s">I</a> think this might have to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7757.916s">This</a> certainly doesn't fall within the scope that I feel as though would be the intent of the legislation at the time it was passed or at the time that it was amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7766.159s">So</a> I'd like to offer that as a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7768.059s">If</a> we can find out how many homes since amending the resolution have actually been saved and restored, as opposed to how many wanted to demolish an old and decrepit building like Pacelli's <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7782.162s">and</a> do something that might add some substantial community gain and also some tax revenue to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7788.246s">You</a> know, how many of those projects just went to the wayside, and the building's still the building that it was, and the demolition delay, all it did was kill the sale, or kill the redevelopment or repurposing of a property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=7800.575s">I</a> think that's important to look at, Mr. President, because, you know, if the goal is to restore historic homes, and our demolition delay ordinance isn't meeting that goal, then why do we have it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8236.021s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8237.161s">And</a> through you to Mr. Mochi, and I apologize if you mentioned this earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8240.743s">Is</a> there some sort of standard that the commission is referring to or using or utilizing that would put them in a position to expand <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8249.286s">the</a> application of the Demolition Delay Ordinance this far? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8253.007s">Is</a> there a federal document, a state document, some sort of guideline that they're going by? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8256.707s">Or</a> is this just kind of willy-nilly, you're going to figure it out as we go along type of stuff?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8294.773s">Yes,</a> that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8295.994s">Don't</a> you think that would be more applicable to log cabins in the woods than it would be about an urban environment with 60,000 people?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8310.737s">And</a> since, you know, you've been around for quite a bit of time, Mr. Mochi, and you've seen, you know, how this process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8318.063s">I</a> mean, is demolition delay being used as a tool to preserve housing or is demolition delay being used as a tool to control development in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8327.291s">I</a> mean, do you feel as though the application is appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8330.994s">Do</a> you feel as though, you know, we're really going down a street that we're looking at preserving historic houses? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8338.315s">Or</a> do you really think that we're going down the street saying, oh my God, this guy wants to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8342.576s">Why</a> are we letting this happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8344.137s">Let's</a> go make it historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8346.317s">Because</a> I feel like everything we're doing is reactionary, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8349.338s">I</a> don't feel like there's any proactive work on establishing what houses in this community would be historic until the day they get an application that they want to knock it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8357.715s">And</a> I think that that's problematic, you know, if we're going to create historic districts and historic commissions, I got a phone call today from somebody who had purchased a home that I applied for a demolition delay permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8368.861s">And,</a> you know, they deemed the home historically significant, and they're moving to create it as a single home historic district. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8376.425s">So</a> now here we have a person that invested a ton of money in a home, you know, he was ready to move in one direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8382.0s">as</a> it goes down that street, the game changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8385.262s">So</a> I don't think it's fair to people, Mr. President, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8387.664s">You</a> know, I don't mind having people come into the community and make investments in our community and play by the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8394.488s">But</a> I think it's unfair to people that are trying to invest and improve our community to have to be scratching their head and wondering what the certainty and uncertainty is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8403.174s">That</a> coupled with the impacts this has on our homeowners, you know, I'm having a very difficult time with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8408.397s">And</a> I think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8410.498s">be</a> inclined to support Councilor Mack's amendment to the existing ordinance, you know, should this thing not be worked out appropriately.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8549.502s">So</a> this is a reactionary response to lack of enforcement as opposed to a necessity?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8621.018s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8622.679s">So</a> there really is no need to change the existing protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8626.601s">There</a> is a need to invest in more rigorous enforcement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8658.407s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8662.168s">That</a> doesn't sound like it really aligns with the legislative intent, Mr. President, when it was passed or amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8668.93s">But</a> again, I will let the chips fall where they may and see where this leads us after Mr. Mulkey provides us with his comprehensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8680.08s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8681.022s">It</a> gives me a bad taste in my mouth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8683.626s">It</a> doesn't feel right to me that someone can invest eight, nine million dollars in a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8690.14s">and</a> then be bound by so many restrictions and levels of bureaucracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8694.821s">You</a> know, especially with all the discussion that we're having about how government operates and the problems that we've seen in Medford relative to its housing and reports that have come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8704.464s">You</a> know, I think that sometimes less government is better than more government. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8707.945s">And</a> if in fact, you know, there is this, you know, belief that there's, you know, systemic racism that's going on in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8715.646s">then</a> maybe we should have less bureaucracy, not more, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8718.487s">Because</a> if government's the problem, then why is government gonna be all over everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8723.649s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8726.01s">I</a> support Councilor Marks' commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8728.331s">And</a> I thank Mr. Mochi and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8730.552s">Kena</a> for being here this evening to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8734.573s">As</a> the legislative body, these things come to us and we're asked what the intent was when it was passed and what are we trying to accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8745.939s">preserving</a> and restoring historic homes is what we're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8749.162s">And</a> if we're not doing that, then we need to take a better how to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8752.324s">So</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8753.185s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8753.805s">I</a> rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8832.385s">make</a> a mistake, Mr. President, and through to Mr. Mulkey, that this was no criticism on the work that your office does. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8837.409s">Quite</a> frankly, I think you're probably the best run office that we have in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8841.233s">And</a> quite frankly, you're also overburdened as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8845.556s">And</a> like Councilor Mack said, to add another layer of <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8848.325s">you</a> know, duties and responsibilities and bureaucracy that you're going to be responsible for, you know, might not make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8853.687s">But</a> I want to be clear that this was no reflection on the job that you do or your office does. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8857.029s">I</a> think you guys do a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8858.669s">And</a> I've always said that you're my favorite department in the city because you guys are unbelievable responsive to the things that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8864.592s">So</a> please, I hope you didn't take that the wrong way.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=8948.44s">Historic</a> commission, yes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9364.093s">What</a> do banks do when you want to get financing for a project and you go into a community that has an 18-month demolition delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9370.456s">What's</a> it like to get financing on a project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9431.442s">That's</a> my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9433.083s">And</a> Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, as a small business owner, can you tell us a little bit about the business you're doing, how many employees you employ?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9480.427s">And</a> again, Mr. President, through you to the gentleman, so you're saying that you probably create on one gut renovation, 20 jobs, 10 jobs? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9494.632s">Let's</a> see, I was at 15 or more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9496.774s">15</a> or more, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9498.275s">And</a> these jobs all pay a living wage, I would assume?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9508.641s">I</a> wish I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9510.683s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9511.943s">I</a> appreciate you taking the time, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9513.865s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9969.966s">This</a> isn't necessarily particularly about one project, the Park Street project, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9973.589s">Number</a> two, Somerville also wants to charge a person that's selling their home, I think, a 2% surcharge to move out of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9979.193s">So</a> if we're using Somerville as a reference point as to what to do here in Medford, I think we're really going to be in big trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9986.938s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I appreciate the speaker, but I did want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=9991.561s">Some</a> of the methodologies that they practice in the city of Somerville come from outer space.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=10487.429s">How</a> many homes that were subject to demolition delay were restored?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11182.461s">Was</a> it last week or the week before, maybe, that the city administration announced a pilot program? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11189.165s">And</a> this pilot program, I believe, was called the Shared Streets Initiative, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11194.588s">And</a> the Shared Streets Initiative, the goal was to close certain streets to vehicular access, except for those that require local access only, to allow for some relief <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11207.426s">during</a> the COVID-19 crisis to ensure that people can participate in recreational activities while also remaining socially distanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11216.013s">If</a> we look at where Pine Ridge Road is located, it's right along the Mystic Valley Parkway by the lake. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11223.119s">This</a> is a recreational area and a recreational destination spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11227.882s">So</a> it might make sense, Mr. President, for us to look at Pine Ridge Road as one of those streets that we limit to local access only so that the residents in the neighborhood can <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11237.113s">partake</a> in recreational activities while also being safe and also protecting the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11244.095s">We</a> see a lot of out-of-towners and a lot of people come to Medford to utilize the many amenities and resources that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11251.357s">And</a> one of the best resources that we have are the Mystic Lakes, a ton of open space, a ton of protected land that our surrounding communities don't necessarily have. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11262.199s">So</a> people come here as a destination to partake in these amenities. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11266.113s">But</a> in the process of that, we are seeing an impact in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11269.095s">So</a> I think that expanding the shared street or piloting the shared street program along Pine Ridge Road is something that would be worthy of exploring, Mr. President, and I'd ask the administration to do such in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11361.097s">I</a> know Councilor Caraviello mentions in his paper that Pine Ridge Road could potentially be a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11368.022s">It</a> is a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11369.223s">It</a> is a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11369.763s">I</a> know in the past the council had requested <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11374.249s">a</a> paper from Ben City Solicitor Rumley relative to private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11378.73s">And</a> I do think that document will be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11380.731s">So</a> I'd like to point out that the council is going down the right track and trying to come up with a solution, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11386.232s">I</a> do believe that the residents of the private way do have the right to implement certain controls, like we've seen in other areas, Momola Way comes to mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11396.594s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11398.515s">I</a> just wanted to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11399.515s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11431.835s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11547.106s">Mr.</a> President, this has been an ongoing problem for <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11551.812s">Gene,</a> let me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11552.393s">I</a> think I started working with Charlie Shannon in 1999, and this was a problem then, and it's been an ongoing problem since. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11559.1s">And</a> working with Representative Donato over the last several years and looking at this issue, I think one of the major hurdles that we're facing is the DCR and their engineering division feels as though <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11571.564s">The</a> gradient in the sight lines at this location by Wright's Pond are inappropriate for a crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11576.991s">They</a> don't meet the standards that have been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11579.574s">So</a> while it'll create some pedestrian safety for crossing, I guess it creates some other problems relative to traffic flow and safety of stopping and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11589.267s">So</a> this is an issue that's been ongoing for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11592.169s">I</a> thank the Council for bringing it up and I also want to recognize the fact that you know this is something that Mr. Donato has been working on for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11600.056s">It's</a> something that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11601.737s">The</a> DCR has, you know, done a mismatch of <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11605.912s">enforcement</a> applications up along the Elm Street area, whether it comes to parking along the fog line and the like for homes that don't have driveways and some other material movements to, you know, keep the pond safer, keep the area around the pond safer, and also address traffic infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11623.222s">But</a> right now we're seeing some changes down at the Highland Ave intersection, Mr. President, along the Fellsway, which is right down the street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11629.105s">And</a> I think these traffic improvements should help our case in moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11633.427s">If</a> they can get a traffic study done over in the city of Malden and address some of the concerns that they have over there, right down the street from us in an area that's not abutting one of our most popular recreational centers, then I think it's important that we pursue this. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11646.734s">I</a> think Councilor Marks was on the right track when he spoke about a traffic study and the need for a traffic study over in the Glenwood area or Medford over in Mr. Serino's house and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11656.899s">And</a> I don't think we're going to be able to accomplish the goals that we want to accomplish in this area without our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11662.882s">So</a> I'd like to amend the paper and request that our traffic engineer conduct an independent traffic study or conduct an informal traffic study on behalf of the city of Medford to begin to formalize arguments against the state's rejection that's been <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11676.437s">well</a> publicized in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=11678.138s">So</a> with that being said, I offer that in the form of an amendment, Mr. President, and I thank the sponsors for bringing this matter forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12373.271s">Is</a> there a policy in place that the administration abides by or goes by relative to the signing of the hanging of signs and banners on City Hall?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12385.977s">I</a> just, I support, you know, what Councilor Bears is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12389.758s">I</a> say, you know, black lives do matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12391.359s">I</a> have no problem saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12393.26s">But</a> I do have a concern when what happens when the next group comes down and says we want to hang our sign on City Hall too. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12403.28s">What</a> are the parameters? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12404.862s">What</a> are the guidelines? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12405.543s">What</a> are the criteria that the administration is going to put into play? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12408.867s">Ultimately,</a> we're not the body that's in charge or control of hanging anything on any city building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12415.075s">We're</a> the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12416.036s">We're</a> responsible for money and zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12418.632s">ordinances.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12419.812s">So</a> in looking at how this is going to play out and going forward, so what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12425.294s">We're</a> telling the mayor, hang the sign, and the mayor's going to go, well, I have a policy that says I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12429.175s">I</a> have a policy that says I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12430.435s">There</a> is no policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12431.435s">We're</a> working on a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=12433.076s">I</a> think it's important to know what the rules of the game are.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13121.838s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, you know, it's not the subject matter of the sign that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13127.263s">It's</a> whether or not the City Council wants to be the repository for all the requests of what signs you want to hang on City Hall absent the policy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13136.132s">So,</a> like I said, when's it going to stop? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13138.173s">If</a> it's this today, you know, I'm telling you right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13141.291s">We're</a> going to have the police here in a week saying that they want to, uh, police lives matter, sign up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13145.333s">And</a> a week after that, they're going to be another organization that says that they want to sign up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13149.254s">Um,</a> you know, so it's a slippery slope to go down, Mr. President, you know, um, his city hall is a beautiful historic building. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13156.197s">Uh,</a> what we should be focusing on beautifying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13158.478s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13158.918s">Not</a> hanging abandons from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13159.738s">In</a> my opinion, um, black lives matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13162.199s">I</a> have no problem saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13163.78s">Um,</a> but Mr. President, you know, we're a government organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13166.381s">We're</a> a government entity and we have to operate like one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13169.521s">I</a> personally don't wanna sit here every week and debate the merits of what sign they're gonna hang up next on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13175.384s">That's</a> a function of the administration and there should be a policy that goes to that effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13179.646s">So</a> with that being said, I support the motion made by Councilor Mux. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13184.269s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13471.427s">The</a> city of Medford will hang a banner reading Black Lives Matter on the front of Medford City Hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13479.253s">Zach,</a> would you be willing to amend that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13854.163s">I</a> do believe the informal policy of previous administration was only city-sponsored events. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=13858.933s">if</a> I'm not mistaken, but that might need to be clarified, but I think that was the ad hoc policy that was adopted by the previous administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=14472.233s">Mr.</a> President, we do have 15 additional items on the agenda as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16088.548s">I</a> do believe it would be pertinent if we allowed everybody who hasn't had an opportunity to speak once to speak before we allow people to speak twice on the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16095.493s">We're</a> now at 11.30 and we still have 15 items left on our agenda to go through, one of which is a financial paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16509.623s">The</a> chair is the parliamentarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16511.024s">The</a> chair runs the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16512.385s">None</a> of the members have objected to the way that the point of information was handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16515.306s">As</a> such, I believe that this is an operational issue, no more, no less. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16520.089s">And</a> quite frankly, at this late hour, and based upon the direction that this conversation is going, and very far off course from whether or not we should hang signs on City Hall, it has now really turned into something, I think, a little bit more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16535.467s">I</a> think it might be prudent for us to take a deep breath maybe and refocus where we are and move on with a vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16988.996s">I'm</a> sure the city clerk has recorded the notes accurately as he does every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=16993.458s">Maybe</a> we shall refer to the city clerk as to what order these operations were made in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17194.533s">The</a> chair is the parliamentarian of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17196.834s">The</a> chair has relied on the opinion of the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17199.775s">The</a> city clerk has made that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17200.956s">Now,</a> if the gentleman wants to question the ruling of the chair, then he would have to make that motion and question the ruling of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17207.762s">here</a> on the floor at which time we would vote as a council as to whether or not we support the decision that the city, that the council president made or not.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=17849.46s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18063.334s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this paper has been something that's been a long time in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18067.438s">I</a> do believe in 2018, a resolution was filed that I sponsored requesting that we expand recreational opportunities in the community, especially passive recreational opportunities at public parks and playgrounds and other open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18081.571s">And</a> one of those recommendations that was made was bocce courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18085.715s">And</a> through the leadership of Mayor Burke at the time, we were able to start a bocce court project. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18090.94s">And</a> this funding right here is going to allow us to complete that project, more portions thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18095.444s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18098.427s">This</a> is something that's been long in the works for a number of years, and it's something that I wholeheartedly support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18353.919s">Motion</a> to table until the administration can provide us with the dates and locations, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18396.111s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18746.091s">Mr.</a> President, this is a paper that's been two years in the making, two years in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18750.574s">It's</a> gone through a very lengthy vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18754.916s">I</a> believe we started this in August of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18756.797s">It</a> went to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18760.139s">It</a> came back to the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18762.32s">The</a> Council failed to act in the specified timeframes that are outlined in Chapter 48 of the General Laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18770.384s">So</a> as such, this paper is going to be required to be referred back again to the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18776.222s">because</a> I do not believe we completed that task within the requisite 180 days from when the paper was introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18783.59s">So</a> with that being said, I respectfully request my colleague withdraw her amendment to the paper that's gone through such a lengthy vetting process, and that we send the paper to the Community Development Board for their review and recommendation, at which time it will be reported back to the council, and then we'll have a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18799.702s">And</a> that public hearing will take place after which then we'll be able to allow, be allowed to vote on the paper for a third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18806.405s">I</a> think that it might be important for us to get the solicitation from the Community Development Board on what they think about this change in the definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18813.548s">The</a> paper that we were working off of was based upon their previous recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18817.649s">So</a> I think that it's very important, Mr. President, if we want to keep this thing moving through the process, that we do so with post haste. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18824.6s">And</a> amending it at this level in the game I don't think is a necessary requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18828.541s">Number</a> one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18828.961s">Number</a> two, I think that when you look at the state regulations that define what a restaurant is, the Architectural Access Board has put out regulations that define what a restaurant is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18840.643s">It's</a> 521 CMR 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18843.664s">Restaurants</a> shall be included, but not limited to cafeterias, lounges, bars, and other places open to the public where food and beverages sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18851.199s">So</a> I don't think that any place that serves food or beverage in there would be classified otherwise based upon the standard that's been established by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18858.823s">And</a> we all know that the state statute would supersede any local ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18863.125s">If</a> we look at chapter 138, which is the liquor laws in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the liquor laws in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts create three definitions for breweries. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18871.69s">And</a> those three definitions are a farmer's license, a brewer's license, or a manufacturer's license, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18877.893s">So</a> when we're creating, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18880.063s">certain</a> definitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18881.464s">I</a> think that it's important that we, number one, have legal counsel be advising us and helping us draft these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18887.247s">Number</a> two, that we have the building commissioner present to discuss with us the impact and application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18892.71s">So</a> at this point, I think that it's premature to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18894.912s">I</a> think the appropriate step that would be in line with past practice would be to refer to the community development board prior to amendment, and then we have the ability to address it going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18904.997s">But</a> that's my position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18906.638s">I</a> respectfully <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18908.007s">request</a> that the councilor make that change, but I understand if she does not want to, and I support her opinion either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=18913.951s">So</a> thank you very much for indulging.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19210.959s">So</a> if we classify breweries as restaurants or brew pubs as restaurants, then they'd fall outside the brewery ordinance because they'd fall under the restaurant ordinance, which looks like it's used number 56 on a table of use chart. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19228.086s">which</a> would be retail sales and consumer services. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19231.027s">So</a> by right, by right, as a restaurant, in C1, C2, you're allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19241.611s">In</a> industrial, it's a special permit by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19244.592s">In</a> an office, it's a special permit by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19246.933s">In</a> a mixed use, it's allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19249.594s">In</a> an apartment, too, it's a special permit by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19253.055s">So</a> you're confused as to what the amendment does. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19258.14s">I</a> mean, if we're defining that a brew pub is a restaurant, then it would operate outside the scope of the brewery ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19265.987s">Are</a> we amending the brewery ordinance to define brew pubs as restaurants? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19270.51s">If</a> we do that, are we amending the table of use chart to require that they fall under the new draft that's been put out, or are we asking that they be addressed under use 56 in our existing zoning use chart? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19285.516s">What</a> is it exactly that we're amending here to allow for this to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19289.718s">And</a> if in fact we do amend the ordinance and change this definition, are we allowing brew pubs in areas that we've already vetted prior that would require a special permit or require certain restrictions on brewing? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19305.866s">In</a> the C-1, for example, there's restrictions on barrels and the number of barrels you can brew without a special permit and by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19314.414s">But</a> if we look at the use chart for restaurants, there is no restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19320.676s">So</a> I'm confused by the amendment probably because I haven't been able to see it in writing and to see what exactly it does mechanically or operationally. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19332.099s">So</a> I'm not comfortable supporting it this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19334.88s">And</a> I was the sponsor of bringing the brewery on the first paper I filed at the beginning of this term was to give CP out of the brewery ordinance and bring it back to life.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19350.677s">But</a> I mean, I think that if we're going to do it, we got to do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19355.422s">And</a> we've gone through a process here that's taken almost a year, 11 months, and we've made great progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19362.65s">And</a> I am very uncomfortable voting on this <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19366.607s">at</a> this late with these amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19368.148s">I'm</a> just not comfortable doing it because of the questions that I just raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19371.65s">You</a> know, legal counsel has to vet the language to make sure we're not doing anything contrary to law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19375.973s">If</a> we are, we've got to go back to the drawing board. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19377.674s">If</a> we are, you know, we're put in a worse position, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19380.656s">So</a> I'd ask that the amendments be introduced after maybe they're referred to legal counsel and then we can introduce them or attach them at a later date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19463.279s">I</a> just do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that the unamended paper before us is the paper that the council had reported out favorably and has to be placed on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19474.211s">The</a> legislative process allows for amendments to be made, but the paper that's before us is the paper that the council voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19479.793s">The</a> amendments weren't adopted through the committee of the whole process or the proper vetting process that's been established previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19485.155s">It's</a> for those reasons that I will be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19486.456s">The</a> uncertainty as to how this amendment will impact the zoning use chart and the application of the special permit process, for those reasons, I'll be voting against it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19494.719s">I</a> support breweries, I was the sponsor of the resolution, but I didn't understand when I got emails today, I didn't understand what they were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19501.442s">Support</a> the Medford brewing, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19503.573s">amendment.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19504.774s">I</a> didn't know what that meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19506.035s">I</a> thought we were making an ordinance for breweries in the city of Medford, and apparently this is an amendment for Medford brewing, which was my misconception. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19515.685s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'll rest my case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19521.41s">I'm</a> not comfortable voting for it this evening for the reasons that I stated, and so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19525.366s">But</a> it's definitely a worthy endeavor and just something that, you know, once it gets through the process for a third reading, you know, I'll be happy to vote for it after I understand it a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19534.193s">But</a> as of right now, I'm not comfortable doing so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=19639.263s">No</a> more than a procedural difference, Mr. President, that's all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20109.683s">Mr.</a> President, this isn't a licensure hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20113.716s">This</a> isn't a hearing on your licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20115.178s">This</a> is a hearing on the ordinance that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20116.84s">We</a> understand what you're trying to accomplish.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20138.586s">Can</a> I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20140.007s">What</a> in the existing ordinance prevents you from doing that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20144.81s">What</a> in the existing ordinance prevents you from doing that absent an amendment?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20154.94s">What</a> I'm saying is, what in the existing ordinance prevents you from calling, from opening a brew pub? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20160.784s">I</a> mean, I think that there's three type of brewery license that you can get, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20164.827s">A</a> farmer's, a farmer brewer, a pub brewer, a manufacturer brewer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20169.25s">Those</a> are the three types of brewery license that you can receive, and those are all defined by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20175.286s">And</a> a restaurant is also defined by state law, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20177.787s">So</a> underneath the existing ordinance, what is it that you're not able to achieve? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20184.39s">What's</a> the district zoned at now that your potential location is in? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20188.231s">Is</a> it non-conforming use or is it something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20191.232s">That's</a> why you're looking for this amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20193.373s">That's</a> what I'm trying to figure out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20206.226s">He's</a> much more intelligent than I am as well, Nick, not you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20208.806s">He's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20210.047s">I</a> know Sean for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20211.187s">He's</a> great.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20557.618s">So</a> ultimately, what we're doing is we're not moving this out of the brewery ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20566.321s">What</a> we're doing is putting a definition into the brewery ordinance that would allow them <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20570.475s">to</a> also sell bottles of vodka that they don't make on site if they get the proper license for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20578.537s">Budweiser,</a> Bud Light products if they want to serve those products because those are products that are provided by a distributor and not manufactured on site.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20598.857s">And</a> then the limitations on the production or the sale is capped at 25%. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20605.219s">Can</a> you clarify that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20644.508s">Now</a> we'll come down to what state license you obtain, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20693.866s">And</a> I do understand that in the licensing process, you know, like you said, you have to go through the, at the federal level, the, the ATB, the Alcohol Tobacco Firearms Bureau, and at the state level, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20704.794s">So</a> there is, you know, some levels of bureaucracy, yeah, because you know, the stuff can blow up and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20709.778s">And</a> you know, I mean, it's, it's not easy to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20712.62s">Okay,</a> I understand this a little bit better now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20715.542s">You</a> know, I still would like legal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20717.579s">So,</a> you know, this evening I probably will not support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20720.78s">However,</a> in the future, once I get my clarifications from council and I feel comfortable, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20725.301s">So</a> thank you very much for allowing me at this late hour to take up more time than we needed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=20730.262s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21136.614s">Yes,</a> sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21189.121s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21273.736s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21293.949s">One</a> more paper, one more paper, one more.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21299.112s">The</a> election day stuff.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21530.839s">Mr.</a> President, after this, can we wrap it up and table everything and go to bed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21533.821s">I</a> got to be up at five for work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21537.003s">This</a> is ridiculous.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21596.933s">Motion</a> to waive the reading, Mr. President, and allow a representative from the administration please provide us with a brief synopsis, including the dates, times, and locations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21727.422s">So</a> it's just kind of like peapod, but it doesn't go to your door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21731.824s">You</a> got to run up to the car and pick it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21768.881s">So</a> it's pretty much, it's like Grubhub that cooks it in the car on the way to your house?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21784.865s">Okay,</a> I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21787.486s">And,</a> you know, so say that the truck is coming to a neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21792.283s">Does</a> the truck stop and stay there though? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21794.004s">You</a> know, I mean, is the truck blocking the street, but you know, do they need street closure permits or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21798.747s">Is</a> it like a block potty type of deal or like a picnic or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21801.709s">Or</a> is it more like the thing pulls on the sidewalk and you go up to the ice cream truck?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21878.666s">And</a> they'd only be able to come five times to the city and that's it based upon what this is saying?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=21885.512s">All</a> right, so this is almost like a trial program to see if this works?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22082.672s">Oh,</a> it's gone too long?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22101.921s">The</a> motion was to take the National Grid permits, Mr. President, to grant the location.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22125.245s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22336.177s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22499.583s">Going</a> forward, Mr. President, as a practice, I feel as though it might be appropriate for us to not hold public hearings at 1 o'clock in the morning.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22508.713s">And</a> I think that, you know, when looking at the way that things have been going and the length of our meetings as of recent due to this wonderful technological advancement that we're using here to promote transparent government, that, you know, we might have to adopt a rule of some sort or amend our rules, Mr. President, to keep these meetings to be within a reasonable timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22529.543s">You</a> know, I think all the studies that we've ever read will show that meetings aren't productive if they last more than two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22534.806s">And</a> we're going on about six now and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22537.459s">1.30</a> in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22538.24s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem with the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22541.922s">I'll</a> move for approval this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22543.623s">But</a> it does raise concern that we're having a public hearing at 1 o'clock in the morning that was advertised for 7 o'clock in the evening yesterday.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22567.409s">I'm</a> just saying, as a practice going forward, I think that this might be not the best of them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22615.122s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=22658.187s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg/2025-06-26_nqVIJ3wsDWg.html">Community Development Board 07-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=1240.668s">I</a> was just wondering who would be deciding the zoning, if it's separated between what the rules are and what the zoning is, who decides where it goes?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17232.956s">Yes,</a> good evening, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17235.478s">For</a> the record, Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer and Braunstein representing the applicant. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17240.001s">Can</a> you hear me okay?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17244.762s">Pleasure</a> to be before you this evening and really been watching the board the past several hours and I don't envy the job that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17254.564s">You</a> do a wonderful job for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17256.324s">So</a> I wanted to just spare you a detailed presentation as you're approaching our, what looks like it's our number five, if you're hearing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17266.046s">I</a> know we had a pretty detailed summary presented at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17270.982s">of</a> what the project involves, but we're talking about the BJ's location at 278 Middlesex Avenue, where BJ's is looking to incorporate a gas facility within their existing parking field. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17286.925s">There'd</a> be no additional pavement proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17289.986s">Everything</a> would be within the existing paved area. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17292.966s">This</a> is a surplus parking area that they feel would be ideally used for this use, which they've incorporated. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17301.543s">many</a> of their other BJ's locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17305.045s">Just</a> to remind the board, this would be limited to BJ's customers only. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17310.988s">This</a> is not open to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17313.029s">It</a> would be limited to BJ's customers only. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17316.511s">And</a> there would not be any service of vehicles or convenience store or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17320.993s">The</a> kiosk that's there just simply <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17324.018s">as</a> an attendant in it, and the only commercial activity, if you would, that could take place there would be someone that might be needing to renew a membership card or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17334.106s">So</a> in our first meeting, we obviously spent a lot of time focusing on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17339.33s">There</a> was a lot of valuable feedback that we got in terms of things for us to look at as a team and get back to the board on with hopefully some answers and some further analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17353.803s">And</a> we feel that we've been able to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17357.666s">We</a> did submit a communication today, Mr. Chairman, with a couple of response letters to the city engineering staff responding to a number of comments that were raised previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17371.356s">We</a> also did submit a response letter to <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17376.552s">the</a> law firm of Anderson and Krieger that represents the two commercial property owners across the street, the gas station across the street and the car wash and some other Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17388.482s">So</a> we did respond to that as well and submitted that to the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17394.659s">Over</a> the past few weeks, we've spent a lot of time having further dialogue with city planning staff, both Alicia and Annie, appreciate the time that it took to meet with us to kind of drill down on a few of these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17407.674s">and</a> also city engineering staff to talk about some of the traffic and other enhancements that we might be able to do kind of outside of the property limits, if you would. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17420.924s">And</a> we did share a couple of concept plans with the board that shows, you know, some, I'm going to turn it over to our traffic engineer, Sean Kelly and Austin Turner, who's with Bowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17436.742s">rather</a> than my repeating what they're about to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17439.584s">But</a> I think the focus has been for us to look at some pedestrian enhancements, additional landscaping that we could provide, even though we're already providing a significant amount of new landscaping with their opportunities to provide even more. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17453.932s">And</a> then on the traffic front, how we might be able to address some additional pedestrian safety enhancements along Middlesex Ave and some ADA accessibility enhancements. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17466.738s">any</a> opportunities to modify that curb opening for the driveway, and further dialogue with MassDOT about the complete streets program and some things that we might be able to explore there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17481.003s">So</a> if I could, I'd like to ask Sean Kelly with Van Assen Associates, our traffic engineer, to <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17489.793s">maybe</a> speak to one of the exhibit plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17492.274s">I</a> don't know who might be able to pull that up, but he can speak a little bit more in depth on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=17499.096s">So,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19343.982s">Yeah,</a> I think Mr. Chairman, we really wanted to gain some feedback from the board, whether we were, you know, we feel that we've, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19353.215s">done</a> a good job of addressing the comments that we have heard before about how we could make improvements out there that would benefit the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19362.057s">I</a> think you acknowledge that, look, Middlesex Ave does see a lot of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19367.238s">We're</a> not in a position to kind of fix Middlesex Ave and everything going on with it, but what can we do to provide some meaningful improvements out there, particularly from a pedestrian perspective, which we've really kind of focused in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19384.818s">But</a> before we finalize any plans with revised drainage or anything like that, we wanted to get your feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19395.344s">So</a> that was it, yeah.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19751.476s">Mr.</a> Chairman, if I could just say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19754.097s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19755.778s">So</a> we certainly appreciate the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19759.019s">I,</a> you know, we do feel that the circulation does work, works well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19763.881s">I</a> think this is consistent with, you know, what a lot of BJ's operations have in terms of the width of the access. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19771.464s">And</a> I know that the gentleman from the national spoke, you know, pointed out what he thought was some liabilities, but, you know, didn't point out that they were, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19781.027s">you</a> know, three other fueling stations available that really would not necessitate people having to queue where, you know, he was showing those queues. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19789.072s">But,</a> you know, we can certainly drill down a little bit further to provide the board more comfort that, you know, we're not going to be creating any type of a traffic hazard or, you know, a bad situation within the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19803.862s">As</a> far as the other improvements, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19810.335s">maybe</a> taking a more holistic look. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19811.956s">I</a> mean, what we really tried to do was provide pedestrian enhancements along Middlesex Avenue to make that a much safer area off of our site for pedestrians, as well as providing a safe pedestrian access route for people to be able to walk to the main store itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19833.307s">I</a> know there was comment about people living nearby that might want to go to the store, buy a gallon of milk, <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19840.032s">I</a> mean, you know, probably going to be walking out there with, you know, shopping carts full of things and walking back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19846.895s">But</a> still, there could be a fair number of people that might want to walk to the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19850.397s">So</a> we are really trying to make a, I would say, a holistic improvement to what's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19856.379s">BJ's</a> takes a lot of pride in this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19859.761s">It's</a> their very first BJ's in their entire portfolio, the first one built. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19865.223s">They</a> really are desirous of <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19867.943s">improving</a> the appearance of it, you know, providing this as an amenity of their customer base. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19873.727s">But,</a> you know, we can certainly, you know, look at some other opportunities to, you know, make some improvements, but, you know, we try to do a good job of, you know, with the feedback that we heard to address it, but we'll continue to have a dialogue, so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19968.435s">Yeah,</a> that's not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/nqVIJ3wsDWg&t=19969.796s">Whatever</a> we need to do to meet statutory deadlines is fine, yeah.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I/2024-11-19_9sF78fOJr5I.html">City Council 06-23-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=160.051s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=161.531s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=169.117s">Papers</a> under suspension.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=186.429s">The</a> only two papers that I filed under suspension this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=191.116s">The</a> first being 20461.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=264.869s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=266.43s">I'm</a> sure that this is a topic that's something that could be ruled out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=270.273s">I'm</a> sure that you are inclined to do such based upon the late filing of the paper alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=275.577s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, this paper does attempt to address a concern that's been raised by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=281.342s">And</a> I do think it does warrant further discussion and deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=285.069s">The</a> question remains, Mr. President, is if the paper's ruled out of order, what direction can we go in later on? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=292.137s">And</a> if the paper's ruled out of order and that motion stands, then this can't be reintroduced for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=297.963s">In</a> the interest, Mr. President, I think we're all aware of the situation and the circumstances as to what it is we're looking for here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=303.989s">I'm</a> hoping that we can table this paper until next week, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=308.152s">There's</a> a lot of concern about people that haven't had an opportunity to participate, whether it be in the school department meetings or in the city council meetings, and the level of participation and the platform that's being used doesn't work for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=320.035s">And</a> I can certainly agree that the platform has been difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=323.996s">I've</a> had a number of technical difficulties myself with it, and we've talked to a number of people, Mr. President, about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=330.077s">So</a> with that being said, there is a matter that's before us here, and I think that it's important that it be given the proper consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=338.66s">And</a> I'm offering an olive branch here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=340.603s">I'd</a> be willing to table this measure this evening and request that yourself as the Council President, Council Caraviello as the Vice President, meet with representatives from the administration, the Director of the Board of Health, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=356.295s">Patrick</a> Gordon, and the mayor, to see if there's a way that we can improve the way that we're doing business here and to improve the virtual platform, the ability for us to have public participation and public input live in some capacity or some way, whether that be a hybrid with Zoom or not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=373.726s">But</a> I'm asking that this matter be tabled this evening with the conditions that, you know, you and Councilor Caraviello meet with those individuals from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=382.652s">You</a> give it one shot, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=384.314s">Meet</a> for one hour tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=385.815s">If</a> we can work something out, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=387.577s">If</a> not, I'd be happy to be bound by the determination that's made by the vice president, the council president, and most parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=393.983s">But</a> I think, Mr. President, this is a topic that there are a number of people in the community that have expressed a great deal of concern about. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=399.808s">There's</a> been a lot of back-and-forth and division in the city of Metro right now about the way that we're conducting business. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=406.874s">And</a> I think it warrants another look to see if we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=410.479s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I also see that we're under a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=413.484s">There</a> is a crunch that we're facing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=416.087s">There</a> are a number of procedural concerns that were raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=418.03s">There</a> are a number of operational concerns that were raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=421.966s">You</a> know, the Medford City Council is a government body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=424.409s">It's</a> a governmental body, and it has to respect and adhere to certain processes that are going to be in the best interest of the citizenry. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=431.899s">That</a> coupled with the fact that, you know, social media isn't a government body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=435.684s">Those</a> platforms do not have to be held to the same <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=439.048s">criteria</a> and standards when it comes down to us conducting business versus the way that matters are bantered back and forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=446.354s">I</a> just think that right now it would make more sense for us to put this item on the table, allow the two leaders that we've elected here in the City Council who are on opposite ends of an issue to come together and meet with the administration and try to work out a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=460.466s">I'm</a> asking for 60 minutes tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=463.692s">but</a> the two leaders of this council to meet with those individuals from the administration, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=468.416s">And</a> if we can move forward in that fashion and you guys can have one last shot at trying to improve the way that we allow the public to participate, I'll be happy to be bound by any determination or any outcome of that one hour meeting that takes place tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=481.528s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do appreciate you entertaining me with the ability to present my position on this matter and why I brought it forward, ultimately bringing it forward to address some transparency issues that have been brought up, to address some procedural issues that have been brought up, and to allow for a call for more public participation that's live in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=503.856s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=521.693s">Mr.</a> President, I think that that's absolutely great and perfectly clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=525.055s">And</a> if you had met and talked to people about that, and there was no way that we could conduct this plan, and you brought that back to the body, and we sat down and had a meeting, and that was explained to us, I think that that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=535.26s">But</a> that's not what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=537.161s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, that this isn't an issue that we're trying to create an internal fight and further divide the community on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=544.305s">And</a> I'm not sitting there saying, Zach and Nicole and John are wrong because they showed up at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=548.647s">That's</a> not what I'm doing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=550.588s">And</a> I'd expect my council colleagues to not do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=553.711s">What</a> I am saying is that there's a concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=555.492s">This</a> concern was brought up, and it came out rapid, very fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=558.395s">There</a> wasn't much time to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=560.036s">And</a> I took a stand, Mr. President, and I stand by that vote that I took. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=562.979s">I</a> felt as though it was important that people be provided an opportunity to present live and talk about the concerns that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=571.057s">and</a> they don't have the opportunity to come to a school committee meeting and face the people that laid them off, I think that that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=576.821s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I've offered this proposal in an effort to try to build a bridge between the two positions of where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=584.907s">And</a> I understand the crunch of time that we're on, so I think that that's a great compromise solution that I'm offering, that you and Council Vice President Caraviello meet with those three individuals tomorrow, sit down, try to hash out a plan where there can be more public <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=598.717s">participation</a> in a live setting in one fashion or another, and we can move on from there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=604.339s">I'd</a> be happy to be bound by the findings of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=608.041s">However,</a> at this point in time, you know, based upon the series of events and circumstances that arose, I didn't feel as though I was informed, I didn't feel as though there was a great good – there was a good deal of communication, and I took a stand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=620.125s">And,</a> you know, if I feel something – if there's something that I think I should stand up for, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=624.407s">I</a> will, and that's what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=626.088s">And,</a> you know, and I've got to look in the mirror every morning and shave my face before I, you know, before I leave the House, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=631.43s">And</a> that's one of the biggest tests for a politician. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=633.451s">Can</a> you look in the mirror every day? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=635.132s">And</a> I always have been able to, and I will continue to do so as long as I serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=639.014s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I offer this proposal that we table this, and the Joint Council of Caraviello Meet, for the purpose of conducting a small meeting, one hour in length, with Marian O'Connor, with Mayor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=654.001s">and</a> with Patrick Gordon, the Director of Community Media, to see if there's ways that we can improve the in-person or real-time public participation of our council meetings, especially relative to the budget hearings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=665.448s">I</a> think that's really what my main focus is on, is the budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=668.13s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=669.191s">Through</a> the rest of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=680.716s">The</a> motion is to be tabled under the conditions that the Council President and the Council Vice President agreed to take these steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=687.461s">And</a> I think that that's a good compromise.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=838.229s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2244.967s">Whatever</a> plan that the parties can agree to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2247.548s">I</a> don't think anything, nothing in the proposal that I put forward was to exclude Zoom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2252.551s">It</a> was just to say that that's a platform that might not work and there may be other platforms that are better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2257.334s">Zoom</a> could have been used for the call-in portion of the public participation, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2262.857s">So,</a> you know, nothing limited this to Zoom, but my concern was that I wanted to be in the same room with the people that were making the cuts so that I could look them in the eye and ask them the questions that I need to ask, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2272.403s">Then</a> there's another layer of concern with the public participation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2277.285s">It's</a> twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2278.406s">But</a> as I've said before, in an effort to move past this issue and to negotiate some sort of compromise that's good for all of us, I offered this compromise proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2287.89s">I</a> asked for it to be second so we can move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2290.192s">Second,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2293.573s">Motion</a> to table ends all debate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2312.623s">Councilor</a> Ioannoni. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2314.684s">The</a> chair never made a ruling on whether or not the paper was out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2317.926s">The</a> paper was introduced, a motion was made before there was a request to have the ruling made on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2322.268s">The</a> motion was the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2323.509s">Then</a> we had a debate on that, then that debate on the table was seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2327.231s">That</a> ends all debate on the topic <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2330.519s">The</a> council wants to go through the exercise of having the paper ruled out of order, having maybe someone call the question of the chair and then going through that whole process again. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2340.185s">I</a> don't see where that's going to get us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2343.026s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, we're all on the same page here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2345.548s">We're</a> all going down the same track here that I think we can agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2348.81s">So</a> let's not put any more obstacles in front of the way and let's get there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2713.735s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2713.915s">Dunley-Benjamin,</a> are you aware when the next set of rates are going to be established by the Water Sewer Commission?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2723.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2728.019s">And</a> do you know what they are offhand?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2738.782s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2740.857s">And</a> this appropriation is going to be used to offset some of that impact to the residential user by keeping it at the balanced rate and using the reserves to offset it so that we don't have to have a further increase.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2755.226s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=2755.906s">I</a> support the paper and move approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4916.392s">Well,</a> that's very disappointing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4920.815s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4922.276s">It's</a> my understanding, based upon my most recent conversation with the Director of the Board of Health, that government bodies were deemed exempt from the 10-person gathering rule, which led me to believe that where we have a budget that's $184 million with a $10 million shortfall, if we were going to be discussing issues of that severity, that we should all be in the same room to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4941.862s">Um,</a> so when the council took a vote to say that we should all meet non-virtually to address these budget hearings The non-virtual piece was us being in the same room. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4950.745s">The</a> virtual component can be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4952.446s">That</a> is what it is Um, you know, so ultimately my concern was this the council voted one way It was never brought back to the council to say that that can't happen and this is why Okay, so we had a meeting on tuesday night and on tuesday night we were talking about how you know We need to have these budget hearings in person and we need to schedule them in person <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4972.508s">All</a> the councils spoke on it, and everyone pretty much was in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4975.51s">Yeah,</a> you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4976.311s">We</a> do need to meet in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4977.792s">Then</a> the budget hearing schedule was published on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4982.115s">Ultimately,</a> at the end of the day, you have four councillors here that are the four senior members of the council with over 100 years of combined experience in government that felt that something was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4992.142s">We</a> felt something was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4993.043s">We</a> felt something needed to be looked at a little further, so we took a stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4996.599s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=4997.22s">I</a> acted as an individual when I said I'm not coming to this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5000.402s">Who</a> knew what, when, and we could go on and on and go tit-for-tat with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5004.746s">You</a> know, I think I told John that I wasn't coming to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5007.628s">John</a> doesn't think I told him clear enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5009.71s">We're</a> going back and forth about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5011.011s">That's</a> not going to accomplish anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5012.572s">That's</a> not going to move us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5014.153s">Me</a> calling John a liar, John calling me a liar, you knew, you didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5018.317s">No,</a> that's not going to do anything to move Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5021.299s">Ultimately,</a> there are four Councilors that are on the board that saw our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5025.688s">We</a> saw our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5027.789s">We</a> have 100 years of combined experience working in government, not as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5031.512s">I</a> mean working in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5032.993s">I've</a> been working in government for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5036.155s">That's</a> where I was coming from with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5037.576s">It</a> wasn't about heeding the advice of the director of the Board of Health because she never really gave us a straight answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5042.68s">My</a> answer was this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5044.381s">My</a> question was this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5045.061s">Does</a> the city council have the ability to meet non-virtually? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5048.363s">Her</a> answer was, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5050.171s">Not</a> a yes or no answer, it was this, that, and the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5052.512s">Ultimately,</a> government bodies are exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5054.413s">That</a> was all that I was looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5055.654s">When</a> we found out that government bodies were exempt, then there was an opportunity for us to further pursue in-person meetings or an in-person component for people to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5064.744s">As</a> I've stated earlier, I'm happy to be bound by the decision that's made by this working group that we've been able to agree upon earlier this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5071.752s">And</a> I look forward to sitting down and discussing the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5073.794s">I'm</a> a big procedural geek when it comes to this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5076.376s">I'm</a> a student of the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5077.397s">I've</a> been working in government for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5079.159s">I</a> studied it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5080.12s">You</a> know, I continue to study it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5082.162s">And</a> it's something that I certainly enjoy doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5085.265s">It's</a> something that I take great pleasure in being able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5089.108s">It's</a> something that I certainly am grateful for the opportunity to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5093.451s">And</a> I'm glad that the people put me here to fight for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5096.754s">And</a> that's what I was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5098.215s">I</a> was fighting for the people that called me and felt like they didn't have a voice, for the little guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5101.978s">You</a> know, we hear time and time again that people talk about the vulnerable and marginalized populations that don't have anybody that's there to fight for them and there to talk for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5110.63s">I</a> was contacted by people that said to me, I can't believe that 111 teachers got laid off and they didn't have an opportunity to go to a meeting and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5121.273s">That's</a> concerning, and I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5122.954s">We'll</a> take the appropriate steps to be sure that we're safe, but ultimately, this is an opportunity for us to discuss about whether or not we can do things better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5132.191s">You</a> know, was there a breakdown in communication? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5133.952s">Yes,</a> there was a breakdown in communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5135.993s">Have</a> we been able to get past that and come up with a plan and a course of action to take so that we can move forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5141.636s">We</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5142.936s">You</a> know, so I don't want anybody to think that, you know, the actions that I took were rooted in any type of malice or any type of, you know, act of disruption. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5152.381s">My</a> concerns were brought to me by my constituents, my constituency that asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5158.264s">I</a> want to have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5159.444s">I</a> want to have a voice, and I want to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5161.623s">If</a> someone's going to lay me off, I want to have the opportunity to sit in front of them and look them in the eye and ask them why and make sure that they feel the human aspect of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5168.192s">So,</a> you know, that's where it's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5170.074s">Mr.</a> Walsh, I certainly understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5172.337s">I'm</a> not a dummy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5172.958s">You</a> know, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5173.558s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5174.099s">Public</a> health professionals and public health professionals, none of us are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5178.082s">But</a> based upon the phased-in reopening plan, the social distance guidelines, and what we're seeing, you know, in other communities, as well as across the city of Metro with reopening, I thought it was something that needed to be looked at further. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5189.352s">So,</a> you know, I can certainly appreciate where you're coming from, and I'm not going to talk any longer than I already have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5193.416s">You're</a> next, Brock, don't worry, you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5195.598s">But,</a> you know, I just want to, I don't want you to think, you know, because my camera's off, I'm not listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5200.482s">My</a> camera's off because I have some technical problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5203.86s">When</a> I have my camera off, my audio is better, so that's something that I'm dealing with personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5209.744s">Over</a> the weekend, I had my friend Paul Hall's dad come over and he looked at everything and he freaking told me what to do and how to do it to improve my signal, and things are working better today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5218.168s">We</a> all have had to go through some growing pains and some learning pains to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5225.37s">It's</a> not a perfect format. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5226.811s">It's</a> not something that everybody's used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5228.552s">It's</a> not something that I'm particularly comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5232.333s">But,</a> at the same time, if this is the way that we have to do business, this is the way that we have to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5236.435s">This</a> is the best alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5237.696s">This</a> is the best alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5239.157s">But,</a> I don't think we should stop having that discussion about when is it going to be possible for us to get back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5244.92s">So,</a> Brock, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5246.261s">I</a> appreciate you giving me the opportunity to blabber on and on about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5249.004s">I</a> really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5249.524s">I</a> talk far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5251.927s">But</a> that's where I was coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5255.19s">I</a> know a lot of people are going to say a lot of the same, and I was going to try to wait until the end, but I also don't want you to ask a question and then hear crickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5261.997s">So</a> I appreciate you entertaining me, and I do welcome further commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5267.342s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5276.881s">And</a> I'm not, I'm not, John, I'm not saying you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5279.423s">And</a> that's not what I'm, you know, I'm saying we could go back and forth and say, who knew what, when, and you told me this and you didn't tell me, what's that going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5285.307s">We're</a> not two kids in the school yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5286.888s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5288.349s">We've</a> got a $184 million budget to tackle, baby. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5290.43s">You</a> know, so, you know, it's just a matter of how we're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5292.852s">We're</a> going to be comfortable doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5294.173s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5294.513s">We're</a> on the right track.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5369.374s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5370.534s">Mr.</a> Walsh, I'm sure you can appreciate, I think I might have a couple of emails in my inbox after the last couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5375.736s">So</a> I'm going to have to dig out that email, but what I will do is forward it to the city clerk as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5381.918s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=5383.098s">They</a> can get it to you if you provide them with your contact information and do it the way you please, because there's nothing to hide.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7016.504s">Mr.</a> President, if I can respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7019.425s">Yes,</a> Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7021.325s">Mr.</a> President, normal practice has been that the mayor would introduce the budget on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7026.226s">And</a> if we look back to past practice, this has happened pretty much every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7031.567s">Last</a> year, it didn't happen, but it should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7034.778s">Pursuant</a> to chapter 44, section 32, it says the mayor has to introduce the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7039.142s">And</a> the normal practice that the council has always gone through would be that the mayor has introduced their budget and this has shown up on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7045.787s">It's</a> been given a council paper number and then the budget proceedings have been scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7051.491s">And</a> the reason that this is important to note is because when the budget is introduced, the council is bound by a certain period of time to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7058.016s">So</a> when we want to see the budget, we want to see the budget introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7061.763s">the</a> budget introduced properly, then we can set up the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7064.125s">Then</a> we have 45 days to act by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7066.306s">We</a> have to either vote a yes or no within 45 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7069.108s">That's</a> what the law says. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7070.91s">So,</a> Mr. President, I think part of the concern is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7074.152s">I</a> didn't feel as though the budget was introduced properly because I didn't see it show up on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7078.375s">Now,</a> we've already gotten concerns and questions about whether or not we violated the open meeting law when we put Adams on under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7088.155s">There's</a> been a lot of talk about whether or not this Zoom platform allows us to communicate effectively between all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7095.279s">And</a> I have my doubts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7097.56s">I</a> don't think that this is the best method for me to do my job, as I've said this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7102.423s">But</a> if it's the best that I got, it's the best that I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7105.405s">I'd</a> much rather be in the same room looking somebody in the eye and working with them, beside them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7109.667s">We're</a> going to play on the same team. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7110.787s">We've</a> got to be on the same court. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7112.808s">But,</a> in terms of, you know, where's the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7115.01s">Where's</a> the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7115.611s">Yeah,</a> I wanted the budget, Mr. President, and I still do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7117.852s">I</a> want it to be introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7119.313s">And</a> it's my understanding that, you know, the mayor had dropped the budget off into the clerk's office by 6-18, and, you know, there was an error that occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7129.081s">There's</a> no other way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7130.082s">There</a> was an error that occurred, a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7131.951s">And</a> I don't hold the clerk's feet to the fire for it, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7135.196s">It's</a> been very difficult and these have been very trying times trying to live our lives through email and through virtual reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7141.286s">But</a> with that being said, you know, if the budget were on the agenda this evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7146.348s">and</a> showed up on the agenda this evening, it was introduced, I'd be at the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7151.091s">The</a> question was, we voted to have meetings one way, the budget was never introduced and then the budget hearings were scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7156.214s">So</a> it became a procedural mess and I got very, very concerned and very confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7160.076s">Matt,</a> coupled with the fact that I've gotten tons of calls about people that wanted to participate live, put me in a position to say, is there a way that we can address some of these concerns that are out there in the community so that it'll work for everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7173.983s">There's</a> no malintent, there's no ill will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7176.467s">We're</a> not trying to delay budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7178.029s">We're</a> not trying to make it so nobody gets to talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7181.134s">That's</a> just not a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7182.756s">That's</a> not the narrative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7184.078s">That's</a> what's being painted, but it's not the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7187.803s">Ultimately,</a> at the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7190.343s">We</a> all work very well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7192.404s">We've</a> put out great work products in the past, and we're going to continue to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7197.207s">All</a> this is is a scheduling issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7198.687s">It's</a> something that we had concerns about, you know, me personally and colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7203.07s">And</a> they've all said, you know, where they're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7204.75s">There's</a> no ill will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7205.911s">This</a> wasn't some organized attempt to stall the way the government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7211.654s">You</a> know, it was four Councilors that had a belief, and their individual beliefs led them to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7218.219s">And</a> if individual beliefs lead you to take action, I think that that's one of the foundations that public participation is rooted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7226.716s">I</a> have individual beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7227.818s">I</a> want to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7228.659s">So</a> I'm going to go and participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7230.504s">And</a> we just wanted to make that easier or better for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7234.048s">Zoom,</a> no Zoom, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7236.991s">I'm</a> not crazy about this platform. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7238.753s">I</a> don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7239.654s">I'm</a> a people person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7240.815s">I</a> want to be around people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7242.097s">I</a> don't want to be stuck in my kitchen with my kids locked in the cellar and they can't use the internet because my bandwidth is weak and I'm having technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7250.606s">I</a> want to be able to roll up my sleeves and get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7253.428s">But,</a> the way to do that, you know, because, you know, the city council is a government body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7258.251s">You</a> know, Facebook isn't a government body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7260.232s">Twitter</a> isn't a government body. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7262.093s">The</a> city council is a government body, and we need to respect and adhere to certain principles and processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7267.996s">And</a> I got a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7269.817s">A</a> concern, you know, I think it was a significant concern, and it's something that we've been able to work past and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7275.46s">And</a> I've talked to the city clerk about it a thousand times, and I've talked to the council president about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7279.662s">I've</a> talked to past council presidents about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7281.637s">It's</a> something we're going to overcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7284.899s">There's</a> a picture being painted that there's four Councilors that are going to have pitchforks in their hands, and they're going to run down to Byrne City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7292.703s">That's</a> not the case at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7294.804s">And</a> that narrative that's being portrayed is absolutely contrary to reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7300.287s">Procedural</a> concerns, operational concerns, functional concerns, they were all legitimate, legitimate concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7307.891s">You</a> might not agree with the reasoning <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7311.235s">for</a> the stand that somebody took. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7313.377s">But</a> you have to appreciate the fact that we believed in something. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7316.921s">Individuals</a> believed in something and took a stand for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7319.483s">That's</a> all this is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7321.525s">We're</a> going to get past this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7322.806s">We're</a> going to get a fiscal year budget done. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7324.628s">We're</a> going to set up a budget hearing schedule in a fashion that's going to work for us, or at least in a fashion where we take another bite at the apple to see if we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7333.497s">That's</a> where I'm coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7335.245s">This</a> wasn't an effort to stop things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7336.966s">This</a> was an effort to improve things, to see if we can do better and to address concerns that we were hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7342.571s">So</a> I can certainly appreciate where everybody's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7346.414s">But</a> there was no ill will. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7348.715s">The</a> reality of the situation is not that the budget wants to be stopped by these four councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7354.36s">We're</a> individuals that are acting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7356.261s">And</a> when I said that the four senior members of the council, that wasn't saying that the other members of the council voice was any less important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7364.852s">What</a> I was saying was that there are people that have experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7369.113s">Experience</a> is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7370.694s">Experience</a> does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7373.895s">That's</a> what I was getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7375.876s">The</a> four senior members of the council, and I said senior members just because we have the most <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7380.512s">It</a> doesn't mean that we're better or worse than anybody else that serves on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7384.994s">It</a> just means that we've experienced these situations more frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7388.995s">We've</a> had more life experiences dealing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7392.296s">When</a> it doesn't pass the smell test before people, then maybe it is something that warrants another look. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7399.758s">We</a> could go on and on all night long, you know what I mean, and throw stones and talk <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7404.838s">what</a> the narrative is on social media and why we're here today because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7411.001s">But</a> at the end of the day, we've been able to work out a solution and a plan to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=7415.724s">And</a> I hope that as the night progresses, we can do that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8467.656s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8468.777s">The</a> question that I asked her was whether or not the public body could meet and deliberate in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8474.7s">Not</a> whether or not the council chambers would be open to the public, not whether or not public participation would be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8482.143s">The</a> question that I asked her was whether or not, pursuant to the governor's executive order, there were any restrictions on the government body meeting in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8491.536s">That</a> answer that she gave versus the question that were asked are a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8494.818s">Um,</a> I've been able to secure a copy of the email that, uh, Mr. Walsh spoke of, and I have already forwarded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8500.543s">I</a> do believe to the city clerk's attention, um, for distribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8504.326s">Um,</a> it's a little likely I'm not going to go through the time of reading it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8507.809s">Um,</a> but you know, I do want to make that very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8510.891s">That,</a> um, my question was, is there a restriction on the council meeting in the council chambers and doing these budget hearings in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8517.413s">That</a> was the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8518.194s">If</a> there is, then we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8519.695s">Then</a> Zoom is the only alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8521.576s">If</a> there's no restriction, then we can meet in person.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8535.788s">That</a> was the ambiguity that I had with it was there was a talk about public participation in the like as well involved in some of that email chain I do believe where it will be open to the general public to come and participate at the meeting in a physical setting, and we know that's not allowed because city halls closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8554.754s">to</a> the general public, but it's open to city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8559.037s">And</a> the members of the Medford City Council are, in fact, city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8562.318s">So</a> City Hall is open to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8564.139s">Now,</a> where we're a government body and we're exempt from the governor's executive order, then the question is, can we meet? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8572.764s">And</a> if we can meet, can we do it safely and in a setting where we're all in the same room? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8576.787s">I</a> mean, that's the question that was being asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8578.748s">You</a> know what I mean?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8582.745s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8583.705s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8584.186s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8584.726s">If</a> you feel that way, that's your prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8586.787s">And</a> I can't change the way you feel, just like you can't change the way I feel when I took a stand for something I believed in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8595.588s">That's</a> okay, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8596.969s">And</a> we can agree to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8598.069s">I</a> think we have a game plan here for us to address some of these concerns and go forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8625.649s">And</a> they're beautiful, let me tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8628.05s">But</a> something is to be said when you have the people in the same room working together.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8640.036s">Granted,</a> there are safety protocols that need to be taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8642.217s">There</a> is a criteria and guideline that's been published. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8646.719s">If</a> people are going back to work, why aren't we? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8649.02s">That's</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8650.181s">If</a> people are going back to work and getting phased in to go back to work, then the city council shouldn't be exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8655.778s">We</a> should be going back to work too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8657.859s">Time</a> out, time out, time out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8661.921s">Let</a> me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8664.101s">And</a> if we look at the governing rules of the city council, the criteria, the Medford City Council shall meet in the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8672.185s">That's</a> what the rules say. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8673.545s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8674.326s">So,</a> I'm not trying to split hairs here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8676.367s">You</a> know, what I'm saying is that I prefer it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8678.769s">I</a> took an oath to do this job to the best of my ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8681.071s">I</a> know I do it better when I'm working with people in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8684.033s">There</a> are mitigating factors and circumstances, and we've come up with a proposal that I think will appease all the needs of everybody that's having conflicting viewpoints on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8693.841s">Come</a> tomorrow at 7 o'clock at night, this issue is going to be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8698.345s">We're</a> either going to have a new game plan or we're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8700.927s">And,</a> you have a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8702.923s">from</a> the four Councilors who have had concern about this to say, if, in fact, this body that we've talked about can't get together and come up with a solution, then all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8713.211s">Game</a> over. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8714.452s">You</a> win. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8715.273s">We're</a> going to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8716.574s">We'll</a> be bound by the determination of the vice president, the council president, the health professional, the community media professional, and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8726.402s">This</a> time tomorrow, this issue is going to be over, and we're going to have a schedule.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8806.938s">You</a> know, as I explained previously in the meeting, there was no nefarious intentions, no nefarious goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8814.543s">You</a> know, what we wanted to do was open it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8816.944s">There</a> was a concern that was brought to me, and I felt as though it was inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8822.125s">I</a> took a stand on that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8823.826s">I'm</a> not in anybody's pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8825.486s">All</a> right, I don't want to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8827.227s">Let</a> me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8829.047s">You</a> had your opportunity that I don't appreciate. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8835.829s">Now,</a> you have the right to say what you want to say and you have the right to your opinion, but what I'm not going to stand for as a public employee is to sit here and have my character and reputation tarnished and criticized, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8846.418s">So,</a> ultimately, I came out and I told you guys where I was coming from and I said why I did what I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8852.383s">That</a> might not be good enough for you, but that's where it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8854.945s">That's</a> where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8856.487s">That's</a> all that it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8858.008s">There's</a> no more and no less, alright? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8860.25s">The</a> council took a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8862.608s">to</a> see if we could have the meetings in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8864.69s">It</a> never came back around to a point that met the majority of the council's satisfaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8871.656s">A</a> stand was taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8873.978s">We've</a> been able to get past this stand, and now we're looking to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8879.983s">I</a> don't think that it's conducive to moving forward if we're going to make accusations like that, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8887.93s">big</a> personal umbrage to it because I feel as though you're attacking my character and you're attacking my reputation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8893.718s">I</a> know that that's probably not your intention because emotions are running high. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8898.155s">And</a> this is an issue that people are very passionate about and I can appreciate that and I can accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8903.556s">However,</a> Mr. President, I think that, you know, as the meeting goes forward, you know, every councilor that has taken a stand on the issue has explained what their intent was and it was not nefarious. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8914.479s">And</a> to say that it is, is, you know, concerning to me, you know, I'm a big boy, you know, I know what I signed up for when I ran for elected office and when I chose to live a public life and I can take people throwing rocks at me and I can take the heat and I can take the stones. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8928.082s">You</a> know, that's not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8929.543s">But</a> I just don't think if you're going to attack my character and call into question my motivations when I've already explained myself, that that's proper. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8937.169s">Now,</a> you know, I know it's not Miss Donahue. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8939.291s">I</a> know that that's a miss walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8944.328s">I</a> can appreciate where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8945.649s">I</a> really can, um, you know, and I thank you for your comments and I thank you for your passion and for your involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8951.391s">But,</a> you know, as I stated before, there's no, I wasn't trying to run down the city hall with pitchforks and light the place on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8957.774s">You</a> know, I was trying to create a process that worked better for people that express concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8962.087s">And</a> I'm sorry if that's not getting through or if the narrative is getting lost in translation, but this isn't, you know, some police unions got me in the pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=8971.054s">And</a> you know, we're not going to be able to be heard because quite frankly the budget hearings have to happen before we vote on the budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9023.32s">Councilor</a> Falco, if I may, you know, I'm absolutely positively willing to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9029.718s">There</a> was a breakdown in communication, and we could have done a better job as a council on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9033.661s">No</a> doubt in my mind, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9035.342s">There</a> was a breakdown in communication on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9037.764s">Part</a> of that has to do with the setting of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9040.185s">But</a> again, I'm bound by whatever it is that this group of people that we've decided can go forward and talk about this comes up with. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9048.991s">I'm</a> bound by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9049.772s">I've</a> already put my – I've already said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9051.353s">I've</a> given my word to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9053.354s">You</a> know, so I think that, you know, our intents are our intents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9059.07s">stated</a> out loud in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9061.352s">It</a> wasn't nefarious. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9063.274s">There</a> was no malintent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9064.655s">There</a> was no ill will towards the process, towards our colleagues, or towards anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9071.461s">It</a> was making sure that we did it right and making sure that the people that had concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9075.435s">Will</a> listen to and people have concerns right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9078.037s">I'm</a> listening to you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=9079.179s">And</a> I I I thank you for that But I think when we're starting to go attack the character of the council is after they've already explained their position and why they did what they did Um is going down a slippery slope with the president.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12968.565s">I'd</a> like to speak.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12972.249s">Mr.</a> President, I'm going to have to excuse myself for about 10 or 15 minutes because I got to put my kids to bed at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12979.515s">So</a> I will be back, but I'm not going to be around for the next 10 minutes just so I can take care of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12984.981s">Councilor</a> Knight, thank you for notifying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=12986.983s">I</a> apologize, but duty calls.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14643.342s">Mr.</a> President, I'll be the first to say, business is business. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14646.203s">There's</a> nothing personal about this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14648.545s">This</a> is business. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14650.886s">It's</a> about advocating for what we think is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14653.807s">And</a> I would never, ever, ever pass judgment upon any one of my councilors for doing the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14658.883s">I</a> think it's important to point out, as Councilor Falco said, John, how long do we go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14662.945s">You</a> were my basketball coach at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14664.566s">Francis</a> when I played CYO when I was in the 10th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14667.628s">I've</a> known you a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14670.329s">We've</a> had plenty of disagreements from that day forward, and we've always been able to get past it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14674.952s">It</a> has never been personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14677.173s">I</a> think that that's what's getting lost in translation here as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14681.132s">There's</a> a narrative that's going on, but there's also a reality that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14684.633s">The</a> reality is that there's not really much infighting going on between this group. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14689.234s">There</a> was a disagreement about a process and a procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14691.795s">That</a> was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14692.675s">That</a> doesn't mean that tomorrow we're not going to go back to work and do the things that we're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14697.316s">People</a> tend to disagree all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14699.357s">That's</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14699.837s">It's</a> healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14701.017s">I</a> mean, I never met two people that ever agreed on everything all the time, and I certainly never met anybody that's right all the time, and that goes for me, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14708.15s">But,</a> what I am saying, Mr. President, and I think it's important to point out, is there was nothing ever anything personal about this discussion and this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14715.317s">It</a> was a matter of a principle and a procedural defect that people felt existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14721.642s">And,</a> we did what we thought was right, and we've come up with a solution to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14726.426s">You</a> know, I think that, you know, for the last four hours and nine minutes, we've sat here and we've listened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14733.871s">to</a> the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14735.431s">Some</a> of the stuff had more to do with other issues and a little bit less to do about our budget schedule and when we're going to schedule it and how we're going to schedule it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14742.415s">And</a> that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14743.836s">But</a> I think that it's time that we move on past the issue, Mr. President, because I think that all the members of the council are all in agreement that we have a, you know, plan of action to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14753.381s">And</a> once that process is exhausted, then, you know, we'll be right back to work again. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14758.244s">And</a> it's not going to be any beef or any sweat if anybody's back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14762.668s">We're</a> here today at the regular council meeting to take care of the business, and we'll continue to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14766.511s">This</a> isn't a personal dispute between anybody on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14769.454s">It</a> was something that was a disagreement about policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14772.576s">That's</a> going to happen from time to time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14775.479s">The</a> narrative that we're all fighting and we can't get along and this and that isn't the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14779.943s">That</a> isn't factual. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14783.506s">I</a> think that, at the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14785.525s">When</a> this budget season closes and when this legislative session closes, this council is going to put out a lot of good work product. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14792.511s">And</a> constituents here in the community and the residents in this community are going to have something to be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14798.216s">And</a> I'm proud to serve with each and every one of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14800.878s">And</a> I owe no hostilities or animosity towards any of you for making the decisions that you make for what you feel are in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14809.846s">So</a> with that being said, I thank <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14812.665s">It</a> says be buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14813.486s">I</a> missed your first name when I was writing it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14815.207s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14816.627s">Sorry,</a> it's Brian, Brian, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14818.989s">I</a> thank Brian for giving the opportunity to kind of let this thing speak on this issue so that we can get down to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14831.937s">Here</a> we are at 1111. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14832.717s">I'm</a> sitting outside my kid's bedroom right now on zoom and they're yelling at me every 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=14839.065s">So,</a> with that being said, you know, we have a plan of action, we've explained ourselves, and I think it's time for us to move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15836.454s">I</a> did not know show a meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15839.395s">We've</a> had many discussions over this and we've also had a source of disagreement as to whether or not this notification was communicated to you appropriately and clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15850.24s">And</a> that's part of this situation that we're in today. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15854.222s">So</a> I think that ultimately, we're at a point now where we're all ready to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15858.304s">We</a> have a game plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15859.784s">So</a> let's do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=15862.786s">I'd</a> ask now if there's nobody else that's willing to talk, but we can close this portion of the meeting and I'll make a motion to table everything that I put on the agenda for later on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16170.035s">Who's</a> tablet?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16532.856s">Reintroduce</a> the motion to revert back to the regular order of business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16587.143s">I'll</a> table indefinitely and I can pull it from the agenda if need be, but my intention would be to take it up next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16594.045s">But</a> if our meeting goes five hours before we start the agenda, then I will not take it up next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16598.366s">So</a> why don't we just keep it under as unfinished business? <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16600.526s">So</a> we'll put it on the table and on unfinished business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16660.982s">Anything</a> with my name on it, I'm tabling that I haven't already withdrawn.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16847.235s">I</a> was going to speak on it, but in the interest of time, Mr. President, I'll second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16850.397s">We</a> can deal with it in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16851.998s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=16852.639s">Or</a> not committee of the whole rather.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17125.993s">Motion</a> for a committee of the whole for the discussion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17242.086s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17676.89s">Good</a> morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/9sF78fOJr5I&t=17677.431s">Have</a> a good day, everyone.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs/2024-11-19_zUQub31GJNs.html">City Council 06-16-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1010.894s">I</a> have a comment, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1014.414s">I</a> haven't heard anything for the last 20 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1018.062s">All</a> right, I'm having significant technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1020.523s">I'm</a> just sitting here looking at frozen screens. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1022.303s">So</a> again, I ask for your leadership moving forward to get us back into council chambers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1058.382s">Mr.</a> President, I'm uncomfortable seconding it, Mr. President, because I missed the whole entire presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1064.164s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1470.127s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I think we've taken the wait-and-see approach for quite a bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1474.813s">We</a> have 14 days left before our budget expires, before the close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1481.101s">We've</a> been very patient. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1482.182s">We've</a> been calling for this budget now for the better part of six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1486.888s">We</a> had a commitment that we were going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1488.77s">We</a> haven't gotten it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1490.19s">I</a> don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1491.031s">We</a> have a consultant that's given us forecasted revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1495.432s">The</a> consultant we're paying money for to do this is the advice that we should be listening to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1500.093s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm very disappointed that we haven't been able to get this budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1504.594s">I</a> know it's no reflection of your leadership, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1506.915s">It's</a> a reflection of the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1509.015s">And</a> I'm very concerned about the direction this community is going in financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1512.976s">I</a> echo some of the concerns that my colleagues have made relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1516.737s">the</a> lack of understanding of the school budget process that's going on by some of our elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1521.14s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, it's going to be very important that we get in there and sit down in a room where we can all work this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1527.723s">So</a> with that being said, I echo some of the sentiments of my council colleagues, but we need to get this thing moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1533.267s">And</a> if the administration doesn't want to participate, that's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1536.088s">But</a> we need to start calling department heads in and start talking to them about what their needs are, whether or not the administration's ready to provide us with money or not, numbers or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1544.292s">It's</a> time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1545.353s">It's</a> time to address the elephant in the room.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1619.556s">The</a> purpose being Mr. President, no, I'm sorry, I didn't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1622.258s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1623.879s">The</a> purpose being to call paper 20435 and 20436 out of order, financial papers, communications from the mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1732.19s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, we do have our – Danielle Evans from the Office of Community Development here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1737.873s">It</a> might be helpful if she provided us with a breakdown of the paper, but it's my understanding that annually we need to appropriate no less than 10 percent of the total CPA revenues to the appropriate category for which they're dedicated, and I do believe that this paper is <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=1754.407s">The</a> goal of this paper is to comply with that, but I'd like to hear from Danielle from OCD, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2225.605s">I</a> actually, Mr. President, I'm having a difficult time, so I just wanted to table papers 2-0-4-2-1, 2-0-4-2-3, and 2-0-4-2-5. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2235.81s">Because</a> of my connection, you know, I don't want to present a paper that you guys can hear me or that I can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2241.613s">So</a> I'd like to table those till next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2299.565s">At</a> this moment, Mr. President, I'd like to withdraw paper 20424 and paper 20427. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2304.328s">Both</a> questions have been asked and answered by the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2383.903s">As</a> we all know, June 6th is the anniversary of D-Day, where many of the young children of the Greatest Generation stormed beaches over in France and fought against the axis of evil to <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2404.292s">make</a> a commitment to freedom, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2406.974s">So</a> with that being said, I think it's very important that we recognize the sacrifices that were made by the young men and women during the D-Day invasion and during World War II, and also recognize the fact that the Greatest Generation is something that we should emulate and try to model ourselves upon, especially now during these difficult and trying times that we're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2426.802s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution and offering a moment of silence for those that were involved in the D-Day invasions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2568.798s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2571.56s">I</a> had the great opportunity of meeting Brian Rabbitt back when I was playing Pop Warner for his father, Jack Rabbitt, and his brother, Jimmy, as my coaches on the A squad as a young kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2583.07s">And</a> I also had the pleasure of representing him as his business agent and union rep when I worked for the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2589.375s">And</a> over the years, we've been able to develop a great friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2592.237s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we point out, any time <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2598.045s">that</a> you turn on the water in your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2601.447s">Think</a> of Brian Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2602.968s">Every</a> time that you run the dishwasher, every time that you take a shower, every time that you get a drink of water, you should think of Brian Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2611.014s">Every</a> time you see a fire department, attach a hose to that fire hydrant outside your house, you should thank Brian Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2617.558s">because</a> he spent the better part of the last three decades, Mr. President, in the trenches doing the dirty work, the stuff that people don't get credit for. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2625.445s">Brian</a> was one hell of a worker, probably the hottest working man in show business when it came to DPW staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2631.67s">There</a> wasn't never a time that I saw him that he wasn't either going to or coming from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2637.455s">The</a> guy was constantly working, constantly covered in mud and dust and dirt from being in those trenches. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2643.662s">And</a> he's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2645.804s">Not</a> only was he a good friend, but he was a great asset and a great public servant. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2649.848s">And</a> I offer my condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2968.043s">I</a> think this resolution is rather self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2971.644s">What</a> it is is a request for the city clerk to just chronicle who it is that's been appointed to city council appointments, when they were appointed, what their expiration date is, and whether or not we need to move forward with renewals or an open application process to solicit new applicants, or maybe offer some opportunity to create some new voices in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=2994.048s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for entertaining this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3001.389s">Again,</a> I do apologize for the technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3004.69s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask for a council colleague to second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3008.611s">I</a> second the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3173.755s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much, and I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3180.098s">Ultimately,</a> we have a demolition delay ordinance that calls for an 18-month period for demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3189.623s">And</a> it was a measure that was put forth with good intentions, but I think this is one of the areas that we need to look at going forward, is the negative impact that an 18-month demolition delay will have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3203.79s">Um,</a> if a person buys a property and they have to wait 18 months, uh, to demolish it, then, um, there could be the potential where the circumstances that we're in right now happen where, uh, you know, they let the property fall into disrepair for a period of a year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3218.02s">Um,</a> let that demolition delay window pass and then.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3239.081s">Get</a> deemed as a historically significant building. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3242.562s">I</a> mean, the only thing historically significant about Pacelli's is the curtains on the third floor apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3249.163s">So</a> I think it's really something that we need to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3253.163s">As</a> I sit here and speak and look at the screen, everybody is frozen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3256.644s">It</a> looks like I'm in a museum, so I'm going to rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3259.284s">But</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3426.724s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3427.664s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3428.144s">It's</a> on the consulate consulate copy all those paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=3432.745s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5645.142s">I'm</a> good, I have audio. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5647.963s">If</a> I turn on my video, I have no audio. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5649.824s">And</a> if I turn on my audio, my video gets messed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zUQub31GJNs&t=5652.425s">But</a> I find the records in order to move for approval.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0/2024-11-19_opOzyZvPRK0.html">City Council 06-09-20</a></h2>

Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=620.29s">Socrates,</a> good to see you again this evening, Phil. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=622.792s">Good</a> to see you too. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=624.503s">A</a> couple questions for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=625.724s">Now</a> this looks like it's a 200 foot trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=628.485s">What's</a> it going to be the typical trench that we used to see in a grounded in grounded inlay trench 18 inches right around the gutter the curb right along the curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=638.452s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=642.254s">Okay,</a> and is this you said it was for system upgrades for reliability circuit circuit or something?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=657.253s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=663.179s">And</a> 200 feet grounded inlay, 18 inches from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=667.304s">And</a> then it says also that some of this work is going to be done in a wooded or treed area. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=671.468s">Is</a> that on city property?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=685.135s">I</a> can double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=685.975s">No,</a> it looks like the tree warden's involved, so it looks like it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=688.376s">Okay,</a> I appreciate you clarifying some of those questions that I have for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=692.397s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=822.47s">Mr.</a> President, I am hoping we can add a condition onto the granting of this location that when the work is complete, the street will be swept. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=833.053s">We've</a> seen Park Street, as Councilor Mark mentioned, Stearns Avenue, Golden Avenue, where a lot of public utility work has been performed, trenching the length of the street to replace pipes and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=844.637s">And</a> what happens is, <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=846.119s">You</a> know, they dig a 200-foot-long trench, and they have a great system of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=849.52s">I</a> mean, they're very efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=851.14s">They</a> take all the stone out of the ground, all the dirt out of the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=854.281s">They</a> put it on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=855.962s">They</a> do the work that they have to get done while the street's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=858.202s">They</a> put all the sand and dirt back in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=860.163s">They</a> seal it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=861.203s">But</a> there is debris left over, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=863.163s">There</a> are rocks and stuff like that that kick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=865.96s">especially</a> on streets that are highly frequented. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=868.682s">You</a> know, if you think about Golden Avenue, you think about Park Street, the amount of cars that drive down the street, kicking up those little rocks do tend to damage vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=876.968s">So</a> that's something that I'd like to ask to be placed on it as a condition that the street be swept the length of the 200 feet for which the trench is being dug.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=963.768s">This</a> petition, Mr. President, I have reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=965.649s">It</a> does look like it is a J-pole only. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=968.429s">And</a> the 200 feet is east of the center line as to where it's located. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=971.97s">It's</a> gonna be a 200 foot run overhead from what Socrates said. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=975.011s">What</a> I have in front of me looks like it's in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=978.672s">So</a> in terms of making that a condition on this petition, I'm not so crazy about it, but in the future, I think that that's something that we need to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=986.414s">So</a> I would ask that it be added to the agenda of items that we've discussed in the past relative to French work when we conduct this meeting with the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=997.115s">but</a> at this point I would withdraw the I would withdraw the restriction.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=1743.504s">Also,</a> Mr. President, that the special permit goes with the business and not with the address.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2367.83s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2370.172s">Mr.</a> President, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2371.597s">Um,</a> as I've stated in the past, I have a, uh, hostile desire that we get a fiscal year budget completed before the close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2381.302s">Um,</a> just last week, I believe we met with our paid outside consultant that said that we're, uh, in a difficult financial situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2389.406s">We</a> have about a $10 million deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2391.788s">Um,</a> we have $183 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2394.889s">Um,</a> the consultant says that he feels as though we do have the ability to put out a fiscal year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2400.658s">The</a> consultant says that there's no way that we want to get involved in a 1-12 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2405.101s">So</a> I'm going to do my best Jerry Maguire here, Mr. President, and ask, where's the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2410.744s">Show</a> me the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2411.684s">Show</a> me the money, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2413.365s">Time</a> that we get to the table and start negotiating this budget, debating this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2418.708s">It's</a> what, June 9th? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2420.589s">The</a> fiscal year closes in 21 days, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2424.011s">We've</a> seen nothing, not one financial paper yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2427.793s">Transparency,</a> where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2429.777s">Where</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2430.578s">Again,</a> come on, Jerry, say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2433.079s">Show</a> me the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2434.16s">Show</a> me the money, Jerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2435.841s">Where</a> is the budget, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2437.662s">Where</a> is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2438.622s">You</a> know, we need to take the bull by the horns, schedule budget debates, invite the administration to come down and participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2445.006s">And</a> if they don't want to, they don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2446.647s">But</a> we got to do something here. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2447.868s">We</a> got to show some leadership that at the end of the day, the residents and the taxpayers in this community know that we're pushing hard to be sure that city services aren't interrupted during these difficult fiscal times. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2457.493s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that you work with the administration to publish a schedule as to when we're going to be able to meet in person to conduct budget debates. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2466.638s">I</a> think, you know, as we're seeing the phases of government and coronavirus to be allowed to start working again, I'm pretty sure that the seven of us plus the department head and the budget director can sit down in a room, be safe, and work out these very significant, serious issues in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2483.306s">So</a> I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2484.267s">Show</a> me the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2485.047s">It's</a> time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2486.602s">That's</a> time, June 9th, June 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2489.343s">I've</a> never, ever, ever in my time working in government and working in this community ever seen a goal this long where we haven't had some sort of budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2497.825s">We</a> have a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2499.005s">The</a> consultant has given us our figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2501.646s">The</a> consultant has told us they're worth $10 million in the hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2504.827s">Last</a> time we talked, the plan was to level fund, to borrow money <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2508.991s">out</a> of our free cash, to take money out of our free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2511.211s">But</a> we're still going to have a structural deficit if we do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2514.492s">So</a> I know there are difficult decisions that need to be made, but that's what we get paid the big bucks to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2519.493s">So</a> quite frankly, we can't sit down at the table and start talking about issues of concern if we don't have a document in front of us to work off of. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2526.354s">So</a> it's very important that we get this budget book and we get it immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2530.035s">My</a> frustration level at this point, Mr. President, is over the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2533.395s">I</a> feel like I've been talking about this now for six, seven, eight weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2536.803s">Um,</a> and we're still no closer to having any understanding as to what the administration's financial plan is to move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2544.625s">Um,</a> so with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2548.126s">I</a> asked the council president to publish a series of meetings as to when we're going to be able to sit down and negotiate this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2554.342s">I'd</a> ask that it be done in line with the recommendations that our paid outside consultant gave us, which says that we can complete the budget before the close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2562.727s">So</a> that's what I asked for, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2564.428s">And</a> I hope that the administration is willing to work with us and has been doing what they're supposed to be doing and preparing a budget for us based upon the forecast that our private paid consultants have given us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2575.294s">There's</a> no point in having outside consultants if we're not going to listen to the information they've given us and use it to make informed data-driven decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2582.965s">So</a> with that being said, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2585.326s">I</a> don't know any more lines from the movie Jerry Maguire. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=2588.808s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this paper and I have all the confidence in the world that you'll be able to make this happen, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3014.839s">I</a> do think it's important to point out, Mr. President, that if we were supposed to meet April 1st, that would have been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3020.681s">And</a> government shutdown happened March 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3023.281s">And</a> I do believe the administration had indicated that they had a working budget based upon the forecast at the time for fiscal year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3033.168s">And</a> I do believe that we requested that that information be shared with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3036.67s">And</a> I do believe that the administration has refused to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3039.752s">I</a> still haven't received that document that we requested, Mr. President, asking for a copy of the working budget that they had.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3085.533s">I</a> agree with the gentleman wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3087.334s">It's</a> the mayor's responsibility to put a budget forward, and I certainly would love to see one, one that has, based on realistic expectations, like the ones that we paid for from our private consultant, the numbers that he gave us, that the private consultant provided us with, so that we were able to forecast accurately, so that we could put together a realistic budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3105.386s">You</a> know, Mr. President, I think that it's important for us to look at the circumstances that are before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3110.893s">We're</a> in a financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3112.174s">We've</a> been in financial crises before, and we've been able to work our way out of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3115.097s">But</a> we've had to work to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3116.619s">So</a> let's get to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3117.82s">That's</a> all I'm saying.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3227.37s">Alicia,</a> was there a working budget for the city of Medford ever prepared?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3265.106s">Okay,</a> so when the chief of staff said three meetings ago that they had a working budget for fiscal year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3272.013s">That</a> wasn't necessarily the case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3278.499s">Sorry,</a> me too. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3279.721s">Yeah,</a> I believe it was represented that the city had a working budget based upon the projections at the time prior to COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3287.698s">for</a> fiscal year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3288.88s">And</a> then Coronavirus hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3290.261s">And</a> then that's why they pulled on it didn't put it out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3300.675s">So</a> we do have a pre Coronavirus budget representing each department in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3317.671s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3318.471s">So</a> there wasn't a working budget that was ready to be looked at and reviewed and debated in the two weeks coming up to April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3325.658s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3326.758s">Thank</a> you very much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3327.699s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3333.689s">You're</a> doing an awful lot of work on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3337.371s">And</a> that's great, we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3340.473s">I</a> find it to be very, very intelligent and I've always enjoyed that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3345.435s">But</a> a silent voice in this has always been the budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3349.838s">And</a> I don't know if the budget director is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3355.941s">I'm</a> not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3359.523s">But</a> it's becoming increasingly frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3363.964s">Do</a> we have a budget director that doesn't come to budget meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3366.065s">We</a> have people that, you know, the budget can't happen because certain people around certain people aren't, but we have a budget director that we're paying to coordinate this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3373.147s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, you know where I stand, I want a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3376.689s">And</a> I want it as soon as we can get it, get as soon as possible so we can get down to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3380.73s">I</a> won't belabor the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3381.631s">And</a> again, I thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3382.511s">Nunley</a> for all the work that she does here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3384.972s">I</a> rest my case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3737.234s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and thank you for indulging me in that very long-winded resolution that I put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3743.661s">Ultimately,</a> I've been concerned about this for some time, and I scratch my head sometimes and wonder if it's appropriate that we have a personnel director serving as judge, jury, and executioner on all matters related to personnel, disability, and diversity in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3759.914s">And</a> the reason I say that, Mr. President, is because when the person that's responsible for personnel in our community wears so many different hats, that becomes a question and a concern as to whether or not he's serving the appropriate master and is in an appropriate role. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3773.682s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, if in fact we have the director of personnel that's serving on, let's say a hiring panel, and there's an individual in our community that feels as though they've been aggrieved based upon a disability issue or a diversity issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3788.14s">course</a> of action would be to go and speak with the disability director or the diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3792.183s">Well,</a> that person would also be the personnel director who sat on the panel, which made a determination that may have made you feel uncomfortable and maybe felt as though your rights have been violated. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3800.769s">So</a> that's the independent check and balance you go to to determine whether or not your rights are being violated and whether or not you're going to be advocated for. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3807.854s">And</a> it puts the personnel director in the precarious position of determining whether or not he's going to be defending the actions of the board he sits on. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3815.268s">or</a> advocating for the personnel that have come before him and asked for the assistance and the help. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3820.789s">So,</a> you know, it's really a structure of government, the consolidation, the government issue, Mr. President, but with a director of personnel has to wear so many hats and we already have made, you know, the recognition, the realization that there is a marginalized and underrepresented population in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3837.093s">The</a> question is whether or not it's a best practice to merge these functions in underneath one <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3842.747s">umbrella</a> in one person, number one, and number two, if by doing that, it creates a situation where individuals are being denied access to a resource and an independent check and balance that they had previously had that they no longer do. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3855.73s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the measure, to send the question to the city solicitor to see if it poses any conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3863.352s">Again,</a> Mr. President, you know, it could be something as simple as an existing employee asking for a reasonable accommodation and the reasonable accommodation not being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3872.554s">So</a> you go to the personnel director, you ask for a reasonable accommodation, it's not being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3876.496s">You</a> go to the director of disability and you say, you know, this is my situation, I need someone to advocate for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3882.438s">If</a> that's the same person, it creates a situation and a circumstance where people might be less likely to come forward, less likely to seek help in advocating for themselves through these offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=3892.441s">So</a> that's why I raised the issue and I'd ask for your support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4630.405s">Mr.</a> President, Peter Fuccioni, the man, the myth, the legend, the man responsible for all those wonderful meals that we received down at Raso's Restaurant, day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4639.852s">One</a> of the hottest working men in show business, Mr. President, just celebrated his 75th birthday, and we wish him 75 more happy and healthy ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4648.559s">Many</a> of us have gotten to know Peter over the years from his work down at Raso's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4652.791s">And</a> before that, in Clarendon Hill at the Genoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4655.372s">And</a> before that, in Beacon Hill at Primo's Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4658.474s">Peter's</a> been in the industry for 70 over 75 years, Mr. President, and he's done an excellent job at it, as evident by the product that they're putting out at Razzles Restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4668.419s">So</a> I just wanted to take an opportunity to wish Peter a happy 75th birthday, and to hope that he has a nice, healthy, and happy summer out there, making sure that we have safe spaces to eat, <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4682.126s">and</a> outdoor dining at Razzles restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4684.071s">He's</a> done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4684.973s">Mr.</a> President's a great guy, a good friend, and I just wish him the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=4687.98s">I</a> ask my council colleagues to join me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5078.274s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this result forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5082.878s">I</a> think it's also important to point out the resilience of the Medford High School class of 2020 senior class, the sacrifices that they had to make, the lost memories and lost opportunities that they've had <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5097.89s">to</a> deal with as a result of the government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5100.731s">You</a> know, I think it's very unfortunate that, you know, um, my little buddy, Mikey Nesta, didn't get to have a senior year of baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5107.395s">I</a> think it's very unfortunate that, uh, you know, our hockey team didn't get to finish this season and, uh, you know, our lacrosse team didn't get to get out there on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5115.019s">Um,</a> you know, those are the sacrifices that these, uh, these, these children made, and these are the memories <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5122.192s">that</a> they're not going to be able to ever make up. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5124.494s">So</a> it's very important, Mr. President, to do the best we can to be sure that we do leave some good memories in their head during this trying time and take extra steps to make sure that they are a special part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5135.702s">So</a> I really think the school department did an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5138.664s">Lisa</a> Evangelista and her team, you know, Moe Levin and the rest of them are a great group of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5143.368s">And,</a> you know, they always put Mentored first, and that's what's very important to me, Mr. President, is the type of people that put Mentored first in these roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5150.653s">And</a> those are two people that, you know, you can't shake a stick at. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5153.235s">Mr.</a> DeLave has done an excellent job in his new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5156.377s">Dr.</a> Vincent's done an excellent job in her new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5158.538s">So</a> I think at this point, you know, we're adapting to this new set of criteria and circumstances that are gonna be governing our life for the next period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=5169.625s">But</a> I think it's very important that we recognize the strength and the sacrifices that the senior class has made in order for us to get where we are today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6000.518s">Mr.</a> President, it's Mary Ann. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6002.399s">You're</a> getting me dizzy over there waving. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6005.901s">Mr.</a> President, this question's for Mary Ann. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6009.47s">I</a> guess my question is this, what does this do in terms of it is, you know, Jack said it was a symbolic gesture. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6016.175s">You</a> know, words on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6019.518s">Does</a> this give us any access to any money, I guess, these are a couple questions I have if we declare a public health emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6026.463s">Does</a> it open up any avenues for us to get resources, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6031.247s">Number</a> two, does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6032.917s">create</a> any obligations for us legally or establish any mandates that we need to follow that may become unfunded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6041.46s">So,</a> you know, is there gonna be an impact on the bottom line if we make a declaration of a public health emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6047.102s">You</a> know, what's the process we have to go through to declare a public health emergency? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6050.503s">And</a> then once you do it, is there any unfunded mandates or other obligations that we need to live up to once that's done? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6058.746s">And</a> does it allow us to have
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6152.637s">I</a> think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6154.718s">So</a> ultimately, you know, by making this declaration, it's more of just a statement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6166.587s">That's</a> what I'm saying to it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6221.389s">In</a> terms of these action plans that the mayor is working on, I'm assuming that some of them are going to require council involvement somewhere along the line, whether it be in terms of passing policy or appropriating funding.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6236.842s">So</a> do you think it might warrant the conversation of us sitting down with the mayor and your office to discuss you know what, what we're really let's put some teeth into this thing if we're going to do it, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6247.911s">symbolic</a> gesture tonight, but you know, I'm, I'm not big on symbolic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6251.734s">I'm</a> more of an action type of guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6253.835s">You</a> know, when it comes down to business, do you think that maybe it would make sense for us to sit down with you and the mayor, the mayor is going to make this declaration already. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6261.915s">Wouldn't</a> it make sense for us all to sit down and kind of craft the declaration and the next steps that would be, you know, suitable and enjoyable for all of us to participate in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6299.627s">Do</a> you think that that would be the best course of action.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6307.773s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6308.313s">Now,</a> June 17 is some sort of meeting I believe that scheduled surround certain parts of this discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6336.135s">I</a> can't find it presently in my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6338.616s">So</a> I guess the question is, is that the suggested course of action? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6341.898s">Do</a> we sit down, meet with the Board of Health, meet with the mayor, the mayor is going to make the declaration, we can join her in putting out a joint statement and actually crafting some next steps and action items? <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6352.964s">Or</a> do we want to make a symbolic statement and move on to the next speech?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6372.998s">Sounds</a> good to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6373.838s">I</a> think that that's a great suggestion myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6376.22s">Mr.</a> President, I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=6377.48s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=8800.968s">Mr.</a> President, I would vote no this evening, and I would like the record to reflect that I feel as though we need to meet with the administration and produce some action items before we move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9538.825s">The</a> paper has been introduced, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9541.307s">It's</a> been read into the record, so I believe by the Council rules, I think we have to maybe move on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9546.431s">But</a> either way, I just think this is a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9549.613s">Now</a> we're writing state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9551.755s">I</a> don't think that's out of scope and purview to, you know, direct the state legislature to amend bills and pieces of legislation that are before them that are going to be impactful to the 351 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9563.373s">We</a> can't even get our affairs in our own house straightened up and we're up there telling people in the statehouse what to put in bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9568.316s">I</a> don't think that that's really appropriate or within the scope of function of by the city council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9573.179s">Um,</a> so as we move forward, you know, I've asked that the council president, uh, remain cognizant of that and, um, take a position as to whether or not that type of action will be out of order or allowed in the future.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9712.975s">Mr.</a> President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and I'd like to <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9716.507s">further</a> amended and ask that the school committee or the superintendent of schools or whoever it may be that's putting this budget together, probably the assistant superintendent of finance, provide us with a draft copy of that department's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9728.056s">As</a> we discussed earlier in the meeting, it's budget time, it's time to get rolling. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9731.8s">If</a> the school department has a budget that's been put together, then we need to see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9735.463s">So</a> if the administration's not willing to give us a whole budget book, then maybe we can seek them out as individual departments so that we can better prepare ourselves for these debates.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9871.553s">Move</a> approval of the paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9873.074s">I</a> thought the explanation was excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=9875.635s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10143.956s">I</a> do believe we tabled an item until the end of the meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=10146.897s">I</a> hope your eyes are well rested and you're ready to start reading.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=12862.56s">Motion</a> to refer the community development board pursuant to chapter 48, section five.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13016.358s">It's</a> a zoning amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13017.919s">So</a> the first reading is us introducing this paper tonight, but by law, we have to send it to the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13024.985s">This</a> would enact the public hearing process where once the CD board receives it, the council and the CD board are required to hold a public hearing and the CD board would be required to report back. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13036.485s">their</a> findings to the council and the council would be precluded from voting on the measure until the CD board provides us with that information or I think got three weeks past from the close of their public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13048.271s">So</a> this isn't the typical ordinance with three readings because it's a zoning amendment, it has to go through the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13054.915s">So</a> the council wouldn't have, you know, a first reading and advertisement and then a third reading, it would be sent it to the CD board, have a public hearing, CD board has a public hearing provides us with their <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13065.38s">recommendation,</a> we close our public hearing that have a certain defined period to deliberate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13077.043s">Yeah,</a> but between it takes 40, it's four votes to take off to go to the CD board, but five votes to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13085.705s">And</a> you can change the language after the CD board because the idea is they're going to have a public hearing and make a recommendation on language, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13177.205s">Not</a> a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/opOzyZvPRK0&t=13178.025s">Table</a> them please, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1965.007s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1966.468s">I'd</a> just like to take a brief opportunity to wish Frank and Dorothy a very happy 40th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1971.711s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to join me in doing such. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1974.833s">Frank</a> and Dorothy have been fixtures down at La Conte Skating Rink for 25-30 years, working with Mephidu Paki. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1981.657s">They're</a> also great neighbors up there in the Hillside area on Benham Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1986.481s">Very</a> recently, Frankie battled cancer very publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1990.103s">And</a> right now he has a clean bill of health and he's doing very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1993.225s">And</a> he and his wife were able to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1996.847s">And</a> here's to 40 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=1998.648s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2060.534s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2062.215s">I</a> had the opportunity to speak with the finance director earlier in the month, and it's been brought to my attention that we will have a surplus of funds in our videographer's account. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2070.601s">And</a> we're looking at bringing on a zoning consultant, and the price of that zoning consultant was a little bit more than we had been allotted in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2079.387s">This</a> is an effort for us to identify funding avenues to complete the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2085.071s">It's</a> been brought to my attention <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2087.263s">through</a> a correspondence from the city clerk that we have found funding to fully fund the $47,500 for our zoning consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2094.525s">But</a> I'd ask that this request stand, Mr. President, so that if there are any contingency fees or contingency expenses that are related to the implementation of our zoning consultant, we have some flexibility and some funds available. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2105.689s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2108.51s">Second,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2130.396s">I</a> do believe we had budgeted for two videographers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2132.958s">One</a> of our videographers took ill and has since resigned from the position or has left from the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2138.582s">And</a> we had some budgeted funds in the account for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2142.444s">It</a> was a personnel related expense.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2184.597s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2186.338s">Mike</a> Meehan was a neighborhood kid from down here in West Medford, a place that we like to be called. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2192.862s">And</a> I recently passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2195.127s">uh...</a> michael was a product of a public schools that he was also a lot of the founding members of the uh... boston people want uh... face book page which has gained some popularity over the past several months with the president dot and uh... michael was just went to rest of this past weekend and uh... there was quite a celebration of life for him down at that point that back uh... where uh... individuals related to that because we've got together and uh... <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2220.618s">did</a> a one bite smash of pizza in honor of Mike Meehan. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2223.259s">But</a> Mike was a gentleman that touched a lot of lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2226.16s">He</a> was someone that's been taken from us far too soon, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=2229.181s">And</a> I just like to offer my condolences to his family and ask that my council colleagues do the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3029.889s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3031.35s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3033.068s">And</a> I appreciate Councilor Caraviello for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3035.869s">It's</a> my understanding that 100% of the units in the 40B proposal would go towards our 10% affordability quota, even though I believe that the number of units in the actual development would be about 25 to 30% affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3055.359s">So</a> it's my understanding, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3058.533s">because</a> these 40 P projects to bring some affordable housing into the community that the entire development discounted towards that 10% quota. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3066.897s">So</a> that's something that we need to take a long hard look at, Mr. President, and quite frankly, you know, I think it's time to negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3074.841s">It's</a> time to call these developers in and sit down with them and work towards <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3079.458s">coming</a> up with a friendly 40B project that's going to be something that can benefit the community and something that can give us some sort of community impact benefits, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3089.52s">So</a> when I look at it, you know, we just lost the safe harbor fight and we've pretty much lost all leverage in negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3098.341s">So</a> now the question comes is, you know, if we're going to get a 40B project, do we want a 40B that's friendly or do we want a 40B that's going to run us over? <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3104.802s">Are</a> we going to fight them every step of the way? <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3106.283s">Are</a> we going to bring them to the table and sit down and work with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3108.89s">And</a> I think that we need to call these developers into the room, Mr. President, and sit down with them and bring them to the table and talk about what concerns we have as a community and what direction we'd like to see them going. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3119.813s">I</a> can't thank Councilor Caraviello enough for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3122.794s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper just to ask if these services are services that are covered under the $60,000 retainer that we've given KP Law, or if they are covered as a la carte services. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=3133.737s">So</a> I would support the council's resolve this evening and thank you for bringing it forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4304.864s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4306.625s">Again,</a> you know, thank you, Councilor Dez and Councilor Morell for looking into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4310.066s">I</a> too had a conversation with Representative Donato just about this very same issue and I'm so glad to see that the representatives so focused on making sure that the businesses on our main streets can survive because that's what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4322.469s">It's</a> about our downtowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4323.669s">It's</a> about Main Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4326.5s">You</a> know, these third party apps don't do anything, but actually take away from the profits of these businesses that are investing in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4334.302s">You</a> know, when we sit down and, uh, we have a community event, the first people to step up, uh, CB scoops, uh, a meat cheese pizza, um, you know, uh, Roswell's pizza places like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4347.146s">It's</a> a minute that anybody picks up the phone and call us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4349.106s">There's</a> other people running there to give us donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4351.447s">I</a> mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4352.083s">God,</a> Marty Murphy, when Marty Murphy was in business, I think he gave away more food than he sold. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4357.649s">And</a> these third-party apps, Mr. President, they really take away from that intimacy, number one, in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4362.815s">But</a> number two, they're taking away from the hard-earned <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4366.471s">the</a> hard-earned spoils that should go to these businesses that have been so committed to making sure that our community is doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4373.32s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to put a B paper forward requesting that our Chamber of Commerce investigate maybe a Medford app that chronicles all the food <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4384.446s">in</a> the community that does delivery services and maybe provide an online platform for them to be able to have people audit through, it'll cut out the middleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4394.028s">So</a> that's just a suggestion, Mr. President, that maybe our Chamber of Commerce can take a look at, but I certainly thank my council colleagues for bringing this resolution forward, and I support it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/zC2BsNwhExU&t=4402.77s">And</a> I'd also like to thank Representative Donato once again for his leadership delivering for Main Street and Methodist.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_PgCiHnwug5U/2024-11-19_PgCiHnwug5U.html">City Council 05-26-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=530.659s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=532.38s">Michael,</a> I thank you for all the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=534.941s">You're</a> excellent in addition to the city's administration when it comes especially to the emergency services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=540.804s">I'm</a> on the day-to-day operations that we have here in the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=544.796s">And</a> Michael Beachy highlighted the fact that we had a lot of community participation, a lot of community flags at Oak Grove. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=552.3s">And</a> I think it's important that we give a shout out to our friends over at the American Legion, 45, Richie Martin, Michael McDevitt, Eliza Boyd, and the crew that organized the flag distribution program this season.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=662.632s">Councilor</a> Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=663.932s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, please bear with me as I'm going through some technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=669.094s">May</a> I make a motion to table this until I can call in the evolution on the phone, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=740.735s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=741.775s">It's</a> National DPW, National Public Works Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=745.736s">The</a> public works have been essential employees since the government shutdown that have been providing great services to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=751.677s">So</a> I'd like to, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=753.003s">move</a> to recognize their work and their commitment to our city and ask my council colleagues for their support as I move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2505.193s">I</a> second that as a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2992.677s">Mr.</a> President, I'd certainly second the amendment offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=2996.958s">And</a> I think it's safe to say that all members of the council have a concern about Southern Maine all members of the council are aware there have been long standing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3007.925s">And</a> all members of the council have ideas about what approach to take to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3013.349s">I</a> think Councilor Marks made some very great suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3016.391s">I</a> think Councilor Scarpelli's made great suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3019.133s">So</a> what I'm hearing is that we want to have a roundtable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3021.647s">with</a> the players from the state administration for district four, as well as our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3027.792s">And</a> also we want to have a committee of the whole meeting with the city administration and the decision makers at the city level. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3036.478s">I</a> think they have great ideas, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3038.519s">And</a> I'd ask that we move to consolidate all amendments to one amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3041.762s">So</a> they require one roll call vote and we move forward on the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3207.385s">I</a> think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that at the present time, for the majority of the day, South Street remains closed as they do the Eversource underground construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3218.794s">And</a> they've implemented some traffic calming measures while construction is going on before the road closure that would be very effective and very cost neutral, to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=3229.443s">So</a> I think this is something that we can get done.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4260.711s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4262.493s">I</a> just ask that any type of update like this be given, be given to us in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4267.317s">I</a> appreciate the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4269.385s">However,</a> I think it's important for us to have something like this in writing, especially where we've appropriated about 25% of the community preservation funds that we've allotted to the affordable housing bucket to this cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4285.94s">You</a> know, I think that the presentation from ABCD might be <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4290.735s">called</a> for rather than members of the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4293.997s">And</a> looking at this, I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the level of involvement that the CPC has on the administration of the grant and the actual application that the grant recipient is having. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4305.123s">I</a> mean, we can administer it and monitor it, but I think it's getting very hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4309.466s">And</a> I don't know how comfortable I feel with that from the feedback that I'm getting and the way that I'm hearing that these are working out. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4315.376s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the mission and the work that we're doing to address some of these community concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4325.283s">I</a> just ask that any response to the resolution also be offered to the council in writing so that we can have a snapshot in time for when we ask for a future update later on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4339.394s">That</a> would be my intention, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4341.095s">Yes,</a> and I'd offer that in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4408.748s">And</a> if I may, Mr. President, this is a motion that I'll make on any paper that requests an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4414.511s">You</a> know, it's a council paper, the paper will be approved, the update should be received in writing as well as by way of the presentation or we should just get the update in writing, but it should definitely be in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4426.078s">So</a> it's not something that's just particular and exclusive to this matter that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4431.1s">I'll</a> continue to ask for these updates in writing for other matters as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4551.315s">Mr.</a> President, it seems like we're on fire with the Community Preservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4554.878s">So</a> I believe on our agenda this evening, we have a request for appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4560.002s">So</a> I'd ask that that paper be taken up out of order, whereas we have our representatives from the CPC before us on the previous matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4746.759s">My</a> question, Mr. President, was just that the second Councilor Caraviello's motion to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4751.542s">That's</a> what these funds are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=4753.163s">It's</a> a very worthy cause and it's something that we've supported in the past and it's something that I will continue to support in the future.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5153.401s">Motion</a> to revert back to the regular order of business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5615.461s">I'm</a> just curious, Mr. President, as to what the policy is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5618.422s">Say</a> Janice in the clerk's office comes into the clerk's office and she has a fever. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5626.6s">And</a> now because she has a fever, I'm assuming that she'd be required to do a 14 day quarantine before she'd be allowed to return back to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5633.946s">How</a> is the administration going to approach situations like that where an individual is mandated to report these health concerns so that they don't spread the virus throughout the department, but they're not necessarily ill or sick? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5649.097s">Is</a> the administration going to do salary continuation, wage continuation, or are they going to require these employees to utilize earned time or sick time during these 14-day quarantine periods if in fact something does arise?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5696.975s">And</a> this is the policy that's been applied for our essential workers, and it will be the policy that is applied and even handedly to the non-essential workers when they do the rollout to phase them back into work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5708.578s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=5709.178s">Appreciate</a> it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6759.094s">Would</a> properties who are in arrears of payments be eligible to participate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6785.146s">Let</a> me rephrase the question I guess the question is, would an applicant be eligible to receive the exemption, if they have already hold the city if they already hold the city
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6807.321s">So</a> that they could have a lot of bill they could always sue a bill, but they'll still get the prop personal property tax exemption through this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6816.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6817.689s">And</a> it's safe to say that this is something that will have an effect on the FY 21 bottom line.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6835.365s">And</a> it's similar to the same shift that we discussed when we were talking about the residential property tax exemption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6843.513s">We</a> still have to collect the same amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6845.335s">It's</a> just a matter of who's going to pay for it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6850.338s">And</a> do you feel as though this might make sense for us to table this discussion where it is a financial issue that will have an impact on the FY 21 budget and wait until we actually have a copy of the FY 21 budget and start those debates before we start moving towards implementing exemptions? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6867.124s">I</a> mean, I'm looking at today's like 528. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6868.665s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6869.865s">June</a> 1 is a few days away. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6872.346s">We're</a> way, way, way, way behind in the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6875.907s">And</a> last I heard, you know, we didn't know what our recap sheet was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6879.35s">So</a> I guess is it wise for us to move forward on an exemption at this time when we don't know what the total fiscal picture is for FY 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6887.256s">We</a> have our paid consultant that has given us a great forecast of worst case scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6892.28s">But</a> it seems though the administration has not committed to producing a budget for us for this next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6897.664s">So</a> with that being said, if we're adopting <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6901.233s">abatements</a> for FY 21 when we don't even know what course we're going to take in terms of a budget, whether it's a one-twelfth budget, a quarterly budget, or a 12-month budget, I think is concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6911.712s">Can</a> you please talk a little bit about that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6966.796s">And</a> then okay so it doesn't have an impact on budget per se and I understand that does it, what's the anticipated cost savings for your department if implemented.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6997.401s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=6997.902s">And</a> in terms of your postage account, how is that looking right now at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7001.427s">juncture</a> in the fiscal year, you maxed out in your postage do you have any money left in that account.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7019.512s">I</a> mean, ultimately, we want to take your money and put it towards our zoning consultant, if in fact, there's going to be a balance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7024.216s">And</a> this is going to save them money on postage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7026.097s">So</a> that was my, my thought surrounding it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7031.721s">Well,</a> we only need 2800 more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7033.202s">So</a> we're close. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7033.823s">We're</a> very close to self funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7036.705s">So</a> with that being said, I do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7038.946s">It</a> seems to me like this is something that's relatively de minimis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7041.968s">And</a> you know, benign in terms of application. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7044.71s">So,</a> you know, I'd like to hear my other council colleagues have to say, but I'm indefinite on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7269.174s">I</a> don't know if you know the answer to this, Madam Assessor, if this is something more appropriate for the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7274.718s">But</a> if we passed a vote on this this evening, but it had a sunset clause that said that, you know, this vote will remain in effect only for the fiscal the current the future fiscal year and would have to be brought up again at a later date next year for further adoption. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7288.509s">Is</a> that something that we could do?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7316.435s">That</a> does it for me, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7486.653s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7489.455s">this</a> evening, we had a meeting concerning the city council's vote on what direction we were gonna go in relative to zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7496.963s">And</a> the council has had a very public open and deliberate process relative to what direction we want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7503.109s">And</a> right now, I believe we're moving forward with the codification process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7507.513s">So</a> with that being said, I think this council has spoken as to what the next steps are in terms of zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7513.578s">And</a> I might ask that the administration withdraw the amendment that's before us this evening so that the council can move forward with the zoning consultant and the codification process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7599.863s">If</a> you look at the tables of use and you look at the language in the proposal, Mr. President, it says that there'll be a 20% commercial for gross floor space, but the allowable 25% is only subject to what's outlined in the table of use charts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7614.215s">And</a> that would be items that don't include biotech. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7618.138s">They</a> don't include retail sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7621.285s">Chief</a> of Staff says that it includes research or biotech, it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7624.288s">Those</a> are actually excluded in the zoning use chat for an apartment one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7628.772s">So</a> I just wanted to point that out that that's not accurate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7700.477s">I</a> certainly have some concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7706.039s">This</a> paper says that any dwelling, any multiple unit dwelling over three stories, it's located in an apartment one, an apartment two, or an apartment three district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7717.322s">So</a> if we look at the zoning map, Mr. President, here in the community, and we look at our apartment one and apartment two districts, because we don't have any apartment three districts, we'll see high street <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7726.718s">Riverside</a> Ave, Washington Street, Salem Street, Winthrop Street, Boston Ave, Mystic Ave, the Wellington Mixed-Use District gets put into effect, Middlesex Ave, Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7738.024s">This</a> proposal says if you wanna build a multi-dwelling that's less than three stories, that you now have to have 25% commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7746.969s">So</a> as I drive down Main Street and I look at a three-story, two-family home, somebody wants to knock that home down and build a new one, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7755.163s">They're</a> not going to be able to do that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7756.744s">They're</a> going to be required to have 25% commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7759.886s">And</a> the council isn't going to be bound on the requirements of the special permit to say that they can't issue the special permit unless that 25% commercial is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7769.313s">This</a> proposal, I don't see how it makes any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7772.375s">In</a> fact, looking at it, it seems to me as though it's a unilateral implementation of a use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7779.18s">We're</a> looking at apartment one and apartment two districts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7782.323s">These</a> are residentially zoned districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7784.63s">And</a> what we're doing is saying, in these residentially zoned districts, you are now required to have commercial use. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7791.072s">So</a> although it's an attempt and it's a noble attempt to increase the commercial tax base, it's not completing the task, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7798.515s">This</a> isn't how we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7799.675s">This</a> isn't how we increase the commercial tax base by requiring residential property owners to become commercial landlords. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7805.897s">That</a> just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7807.918s">You</a> know, when we're looking at development and growth and increasing a commercial base, maybe we start looking at Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7815.405s">and</a> Riverside Ave, and Route 16, and we look at the Malden River, and we look at all the open space that we have there along Route 16, and we look at the community path that we have on Route 16, and we look at the fact that we have housing already on Locust Street, we have housing already on Mystic Avenue, and we have a number of underutilized large parcels in between Locust Street and the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7839.586s">Maybe</a> that's what we should be focusing our effort if we want to increase our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7843.52s">But</a> for us to unilaterally impose this on residential property owners to turn them into commercial land brokers, I don't think it's fair or right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7851.321s">And</a> I don't think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7853.162s">Um,</a> so if you can build an apartment building by right, that's three stories in an apartment, one district, like say off of Salem street on tainter street, which is an apartment, one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7864.123s">Um,</a> if someone has 6,000 square feet, they're eligible to build a two family home by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7870.164s">It's</a> three stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7871.585s">So</a> now on tainter street, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7873.541s">We're</a> going to have a home that's now part home, 25% business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7879.924s">The</a> business use that's allowed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7881.805s">If</a> we look at the use shot is very limiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7883.966s">It's</a> not restaurants and bakeries, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7886.788s">It's</a> daycares. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7888.789s">It's</a> let's see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7890.049s">I</a> got it written down right here somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7894.291s">Um,</a> it's daycares. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7896.272s">It's,</a> um, medical uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7898.205s">It's</a> nothing that, you know, brings, uh, sustainable jobs to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7902.487s">It's</a> nothing that brings jobs to create a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7905.409s">Um,</a> it's private clubs are allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7908.231s">Um,</a> but nothing, no consumer service industries whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7912.033s">You</a> can't have a law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7913.714s">You</a> can't have a tax prep. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7915.255s">You</a> can't have a laundry mat. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7916.896s">You</a> can't have a convenience store. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7918.817s">Um,</a> I just think this is a misguided proposal from the start, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7922.679s">Um,</a> but whereas it is a zoning proposal, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7925.202s">I'd</a> be happy to send it to the Community Development Board and get their feedback on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7929.764s">However,</a> I feel as though the presentation that was made, it's not exactly an accurate reflection of what the paper does. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7936.867s">And,</a> you know, the allowed uses and special permit uses that are defined are really not conducive to any economic development strategy that would bring a living, a job to provide a living wage to the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7962.914s">Actually,</a> my original motion was asking that the administration withdraw the proposal based on the fact that the Council just one hour ago voted to move forward in a certain format and forum for codification of zoning as the first step in zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7975.844s">I</a> think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7981.771s">I</a> guess I have a few questions for the chief of staff on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7985.854s">Were</a> was there any consultants involved in putting together this plan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7995.3s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=7996.081s">Was</a> there any community input and putting together this plan?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8079.54s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8080.24s">So</a> is there any briefing by the mayor or the OCD direct OCD director on the impact that this is going to have in writing on how it relates to the vision of growth in the community?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8095.785s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8096.325s">And</a> is there a zoning consultant that's provided any independent analysis and made this information available on the website prior to the introduction to the legislative proposal?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8111.123s">Yeah,</a> because the reason I ask these questions, Mr. President, is because if we go back to August 12, 2019, there's an opinion piece that says a detailed plan to approach Medford zoning written by the current mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8132.615s">Op</a> Ed has 18 ideas to improve engagement and results in how our city changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8139.098s">And</a> this article starts off saying that before any type of measure like this would be made, there'd be a review of the zoning map after public input with consultants and a high degree of community input, where they will identify multi-use zones where local businesses would benefit from additional growth and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8157.145s">It</a> then goes on to say that any legislative proposal, which this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8161.108s">would</a> include a full briefing by the mayor and the OCD director on the impact with an explanation and writing on how it would relate to the vision of growth in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8170.498s">And</a> further, it says it would require a zoning consultant to provide independent analysis and make this information available on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8177.182s">So</a> apparently a lot's changed from August 12th, 2019 till today, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8181.866s">However,</a> I again reiterate that this is an item that's a zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8186.11s">I</a> have no problem forwarding it to the community development board as required by chapter 48, section five. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8192.216s">However,</a> when this thing comes back, there's no way in hell I could forget support this thing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8264.655s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8265.275s">I</a> missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8265.976s">Can</a> you say how you're going to move forward again? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8270.701s">What</a> was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8271.201s">The</a> conference of plan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8296.331s">Motion</a> to refer to the community development board as required by chapter 48 section 5.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8753.672s">I</a> would certainly be happy to reintroduce my motion to have the administration withdraw the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8758.094s">However,</a> it seems as though they weren't willing to do such based upon the presentation that they gave at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8762.977s">So</a> I'll revert to the second motion that I did make, yes, to send it to the CD board.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8906.875s">It's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8907.635s">We</a> do have a meeting on this tomorrow evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8911.497s">And</a> the scope of that meeting is just going to be on the zoning amendment portion of this document.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8923.715s">Okay,</a> and then we're gonna complete that task and then move on to the selection committee part. <a href="https://youtu.be/PgCiHnwug5U&t=8928.199s">Excellent,</a> thank you very much, I appreciate it.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_Vqhy8xSBDPs/2024-11-19_Vqhy8xSBDPs.html">City Council 05-19-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=268.892s">There's</a> much uncertainty surrounding our financial situation in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=274.535s">And</a> I think the only certainty that we have is that times are bad right now and that we forecast the revenues that aren't meeting our expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=285.182s">And</a> when we come into situations like this, there are many ways that we can address the financial crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=292.707s">before</a> us, and one of those ways is to offer early retirement incentives to employees that have been working in the City of Medford for an extended period of time, make a good deal of money, top staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=308.092s">and</a> that sometimes pay—sometimes contribute less into the pension fund based upon, you know, whenever they were hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=316.399s">So,</a> you know, this 5 percent contribution rate, 7 percent, 9 percent, 9 plus 2 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=324.366s">So</a> this is a way, Mr. President, of getting individuals off the rolls that were contributing at a lower rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=333.082s">which</a> will, in essence, provide us with a cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=337.163s">Through</a> the administration to the retirement board and report be issued back to the city council examining the feasibility of such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=440.109s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=442.251s">Again,</a> as we look at the fiscal picture that's before CFO Fiscal Year 21, there are many uncertainties. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=450.276s">We</a> met with our consultant just a couple weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=452.698s">We</a> talked about our fixed costs, what they were, knowing what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=457.241s">We</a> have made commitments in this community to capital projects and capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=461.964s">One</a> of those projects that's underway right now is the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=464.626s">And</a> there is going to have to be a <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=468.108s">appropriation</a> made by the city to complete construction for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=471.991s">Then</a> we have also a commitment for construction of a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=477.175s">So</a> when we look at these capital needs with the fiscal picture that's before us, Mr. President, I think it's important that we understand going forward what it is that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=486.682s">Some</a> of our colleagues in government have been very vocal <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=490.525s">in</a> their desires to borrow, spend, and tax their way out of this fiscal crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=495.809s">And</a> I don't necessarily think that that's the best practice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=500.173s">So</a> before we start determining what road we have to take, I think we need to get all the information before so that we can make an informed decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=507.979s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=512.362s">I</a> think this information will provide helpful when we develop a budget capital plan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=764.365s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=977.372s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=980.134s">In</a> times like this, it's very odd because, you know, when crisis arises, people rely on government more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=989.607s">I</a> think that our Office of Substance Abuse Prevention has done an excellent job over the years in addressing the concerns that we've had in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=998.332s">I</a> certainly think that we've made great strides in combating the opioid addiction in the city of Medford and other substance abuse problems that we've seen here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1008.137s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, with the government shutdown comes a change in our ability to deliver services at the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1015.068s">that</a> we were delivering them before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1016.929s">So</a> I just ask that the Office of Substance Abuse and Prevention report back to us what the current trends are, what they're seeing, so that we can be better informed and more aware of what approaches need to be taken to continue to be successful in combating opioid addiction in the city of Manhattan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1084.049s">Council</a> and I. Yeah, Mr. President, I think as we learn more and more about the coronavirus, one of the things we've <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1093.213s">been</a> able to really appreciate is the work that our first responders perform, our firefighters, our police officers, our DPW and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1101.68s">And</a> it gets me thinking, Mr. President, what happens if, say, there's a coronavirus outbreak among all the members of B group in the fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1110.547s">What</a> happens then? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1111.528s">Or</a> if one firehouse becomes infected and two or three groups in the same firehouse become infected? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1117.35s">What's</a> our emergency response plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1118.971s">What</a> steps are we taking to be sure that the community is going to be safe and that we're going to be able to deliver the high level of quality public safety services that we've been able to deliver in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1128.736s">So</a> I offer this resolution, hoping to learn a little bit more about this, Mr. President, so that we operate to address any type of issue like this in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1136.74s">You</a> know, when we pick up the phone and we call 911, these are the people that we rely on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1141.663s">So</a> I think that it only makes sense that we show some concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1144.31s">as</a> to what's going on in their lives, and be sure that there are plans in place to protect them, number one, and number two, to be sure to deliver the same levels of protection to the citizenry here in the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1176.341s">Second</a> that, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1699.323s">I've</a> made my frustrations with this virtual governing well-known Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1706.846s">I</a> know that we've passed resolutions in the past calling for budget debates to be held in a non-virtual setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1716.65s">Have</a> you gotten any update from them?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1738.599s">And</a> I think that, you know, looking at what we do has to be a part of the phased rollout that the governor proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1747.266s">And</a> I don't think that we'd be able to meet prior to June 1st anyway, based upon the criteria that he's put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1754.991s">I</a> sure wish we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1756.853s">So,</a> you know, I definitely support councilor Caraviello's <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1759.975s">I</a> think it is a good measure to come up with some sort of outside-the-box solution to allow us to resume businesses normally as possible.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1951.827s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1953.588s">I'm</a> glad to have had the privilege and pleasure of working with both Nancy White and Representative Donato. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1960.573s">And,</a> you know, I can't tell you the amount of dedication and commitment they put forth to the democratic body in the city of Medford, but also in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1968.639s">And</a> when you look at the work that they've done, it's really commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1971.901s">You</a> know, you look at Representative Donato and the <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1974.722s">amount</a> of service that he's provided to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1977.143s">Years</a> and years of service, always delivering, year in and year out, bringing home the bacon, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1982.165s">You</a> know, making sure that our local aid numbers are hitting the spot, making sure that we're able to provide certain infrastructure improvements in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1990.069s">I</a> mean, Representative Donato has done an excellent job up on Beacon Health, and I'm really looking forward to supporting him again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=1996.311s">When</a> we look at Nancy White and the work that she's done in organizing the community and making sure that people stay active and involved, <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2002.603s">and</a> want to be a part of the democratic process here in the community, fighting for the shared values that we all can agree upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2009.467s">It's</a> really commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2010.367s">Both</a> of them are excellent, excellent resources, and I hope that they remain involved, remain active, because we certainly need them to be participants in our government, especially during these trying times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2021.753s">They</a> bring years of experience and a wealth of knowledge, Mr. President, and these are people we need to keep in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2027.917s">So</a> with that being said, I thank them both for their service, and I thank the sponsors of this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2313.332s">Um,</a> I, as one member of this body, Mr. President also as, um, uh, registered Democrat here in the city of Medford, um, do not share the same concerns that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2324.978s">Paul</a> does. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2326.198s">Um,</a> especially when it comes to my colleague here on the council, um, you know, partisan politics are one thing, but, um, you know, to express concern over a Councilor of morale's abilities or qualifications to serve in that capacity, I don't think is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2340.964s">quite</a> frankly, Mr. President, I think she's been a breath of fresh air on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2344.229s">She's</a> someone that I certainly enjoy working with and she has an open mind and brings different viewpoints to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2350.559s">So</a> I just want to say that she's a pleasure to work with and I really don't think that hooking <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2357.368s">at</a> the presentation that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2359.61s">Paul</a> made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2360.171s">And</a> I understand, Joyce, you know what I mean, that you're a representative of the Republican Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2365.095s">But</a> this is here to congratulate a member of our body on an achievement in not making a personal attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2372.221s">And</a> I just want to stand beside my colleague and support her and congratulate her. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2376.264s">Joyce,</a> I certainly respect your opinion and understand where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2379.367s">But,</a> you know, in times like this when <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2381.915s">There's</a> so much going on in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2383.595s">We</a> need to stand together and focus on the positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2385.836s">And</a> again, the shared values that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2388.056s">And</a> I think Councilor Morell comes to the board with an open mind, and she's someone that's going to be able to do just fine in that role. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=2395.017s">They</a> have big shoes to fill, and I think that they'll be able to fill them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3630.01s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, to John and Teresa and John and Jared, you know, her son-in-law and grandchildren, child, you know, it's just a tragic, tragic loss that happened so suddenly, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3645.33s">regardless</a> of Amelia's role in the community, the role that she played to her family was far, far, far more important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3652.515s">And,</a> you know, having had the opportunity to go to school with Teresa and get to know her over the years through a relationship with her husband, John, I just want to say that they did a great job raising their children and she will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=3666.325s">So</a> with that being said, my condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4013.521s">Can</a> I offer that in the way of a motion, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4018.725s">Can</a> I offer that in the way of a motion?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4021.927s">That</a> we meet in the first week in June, if possible?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4058.18s">And</a> if I may, Mr. President, maybe we can extend an invitation to some of our colleagues on the school committee to come and attend this meeting after the first so that they can see what happens on the other side of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4071.032s">when</a> we're looking at each department here in the community and the competing needs that lay before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Vqhy8xSBDPs&t=4075.894s">So</a> I'd also offer them the form of a motion that we extend an invitation to the members of the school committee to appear as spectators at this public meeting so that they can hear it firsthand from the consultant at the same time we do.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_JBgoiGlSfTo/2024-11-19_JBgoiGlSfTo.html">City Council 05-12-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1405.226s">Mr.</a> President, you're the chair you can pick what you want so it doesn't matter to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1451.244s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1453.664s">So</a> Tim, as I understand the project that's before us this evening, the only matter that the council really has the purview to vote on this evening would be whether or not we authorize the land taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1464.266s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1480.841s">And</a> I did hear in your presentation that a hundred percent of the property owners that are impacted by this have signed off on the project There's there's no actual sign off Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1549.565s">So,</a> but you've, so have you had, has their personal contact been made with 100% of the people that are going to be impacted by this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1556.09s">Yes,</a> that is correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1557.831s">I</a> just, you know, I don't want to see this thing, say we vote on it tonight and then tomorrow someone saying, what the hell are they doing on my front lawn? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1564.716s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1565.456s">I</a> want to make sure that everybody's well aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1568.218s">Communications</a> have been a strong suit in the city of Medford when it comes to certain aspects of construction projects.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1648.946s">So</a> based on the current financial state at the federal and state level, is that commitment for those funds still there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1661.658s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1662.458s">And</a> the last question that I have, and I promise it's my last question, would be, what's the estimated cost to the taxpayer for the completion of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1672.063s">You</a> said it's about $83,000 in Chapter 90 funds that we're going to be using from our budget that would go to roadway repairs for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1679.026s">Is</a> there any other expenditure that would have to come out of the city's coffers in order for us to complete the project?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1719.18s">You</a> know if there's any water valves that need to be replaced we replace them things like that In terms of just the scope of the grant, you know, I mean, I'm not worried about other structure projects that might come along with it I mean if we're planning smartly, I would hope that that's what we do I would hope that if we're gonna up the street that we go on the ground and we fix the underground infrastructure to Yeah, but in terms of the funds Yeah, okay <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1742.782s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1743.702s">But</a> it wouldn't exceed $100,000 is what you're telling me based upon the 83,000 from the Chapter 90 funds and then any ancillary costs.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1764.509s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1765.75s">It's</a> already been <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1767.213s">That</a> money's out the window already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1774.079s">Right,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1775.04s">All</a> right, so in terms of the overall investment that the city's made in the return on the investment, we're looking at making an investment of maybe somewhere around $150,000 for the total cost to the community, and we're getting a million point two back? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1788.572s">Yeah,</a> that's a good way to put it, yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1790.453s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1791.194s">Thank</a> you, Mr. McGiven. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1791.995s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1792.555s">You</a> always do come prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=1793.876s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3522.196s">Mr.</a> President, I think based upon what I'm hearing from my colleagues that this thing's ready for a vote and I'd move for approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=3530.422s">Second</a> Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4940.337s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4941.878s">And</a> I thank you for going through that very long history that was outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4947.523s">in</a> the resolution that Councilor Caraviello and I have put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4951.744s">Ultimately,</a> it was a long resolution because there's a longstanding history of the allowance of a use variance here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4958.526s">And</a> if you look at the history, Mr. President, you'll see that in 2016, an opinion was asked of the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4965.249s">The</a> solicitor produced an opinion that said use variances were authorized in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4970.73s">In</a> 2017, we had a proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4973.513s">that</a> was made by a Councilor to deauthorize use variances in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4978.296s">If,</a> in fact, use variances weren't authorized in the city of Medford, there would be no need for a Councilor to file a paper requesting that they be deauthorized in 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4988.702s">In</a> 2018, Mr. President, another paper was offered before the council by a Councilor to deauthorize the use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4996.107s">Again,</a> this paper failed to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=4999.136s">If</a> use variances did not exist in the city of Medford, there would be no need for the legislative body to bring a proposal forward to deauthorize the use variance in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5008.962s">Mr.</a> President, then we have a roll call vote that passed by super majority, adopting the city solicitor's opinion of August 12th, 2016, which states that use variances are allowed and authorized in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5026.567s">The</a> solicitor's opinion went on to say that the codified ordinances in the city of Medford do not reflect such. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5033.412s">There</a> was a Scribner's error that has been made and that we can correct this Scribner's error by passage of resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5041.918s">The</a> council passed paper 18376, which called for adoption of the city solicitor's opinion and amendment to the codified ordinance to reflect such. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5053.413s">Allowing</a> the use variance has been a longstanding policy in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5058.895s">It</a> is the public policy established by the council, the legislative arm of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5065.417s">It</a> is the job of the boards and commissions in this community not to establish public policy, but to execute it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5071.919s">When</a> applicants before the Zoning Board of Appeals are being told inaccurate information that use variances are prohibited, when they clearly are allowed, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5080.089s">as</a> supported by the opinion of the solicitor, the lack of a legal challenge, and the action of the legislative body in the community, this irresponsible action opens up the city to vulnerabilities and liabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5093.513s">Applicants</a> before the Zoning Board of Appeals have the right to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5097.034s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals has applicants before it that are requesting use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5105.616s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals is raising the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5108.186s">Do</a> use variances exist in the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5111.348s">That</a> question has been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5112.669s">It's</a> been answered and it's been time-tested, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5116.512s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals is in a position right now to take a look at this issue, to reaffirm the opinion of the city solicitor or to challenge it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5124.637s">But</a> applicants that come before the Zoning Board shouldn't be turned around, turned away when someone makes a statement saying, I don't have the authority to issue use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5133.743s">They're</a> not authorized in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5135.796s">when</a> the legislative history clearly indicates that they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5138.94s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support this resolution as before.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5436.044s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5438.114s">The</a> city solicitor came up with an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5439.935s">The</a> opinion has gone unchallenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5442.497s">In</a> 2018, this council by a super majority vote adopted that solicitor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5447.48s">If</a> we look back at the lawsuit from 2016, one thing I think that we're failing to talk about is the fact that we got thrown out of court by the judge by having no standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5458.568s">The</a> issue has never been decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5459.989s">It</a> was never challenged because it was never decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5462.531s">Ultimately,</a> the question before this council is, have we adopted <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5467.349s">The</a> city solicited his opinion based upon the research that he performed, which would be the law of the community that says use variances are allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5475.852s">This</a> council has adopted that opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5477.892s">That</a> is the legislative history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5479.913s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to move forward on the...
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5500.743s">To</a> change that, there's a process to go about changing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5503.645s">When</a> Papers 17007 and Papers 18354 came before the council, they failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5510.71s">In</a> 2016, we challenged the local street development, and there was a discussion about use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5518.535s">In</a> 2016, the solicitor also put an opinion, and it said use variances are authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5523.012s">In</a> 2017, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5528.214s">In</a> 2018, a paper was filed to deauthorize use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5531.336s">If</a> use variances didn't exist, there'd be no need to file the papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5535.077s">In</a> 2018, the council then went on to say, look it, use variances do exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5539.859s">It</a> is the legislative intent of this body, the legislative body responsible for the implementation of the Zoning Act to clarify that this does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5549.683s">And</a> we want to pass this <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5551.84s">clarification</a> on to the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5554.341s">That's</a> what this paper is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5555.921s">You</a> know, use variances are allowed because that's been determined by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5561.103s">And</a> that's the law of the land.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5625.505s">You're</a> the point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5707.127s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe that I've presented quite a bit of documentation relative to the fact, and that documentation was produced by the administration and produced by the city's lawyer, the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5716.293s">Ultimately,</a> I think we need to keep the facts straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5719.115s">What</a> the council appealed, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5721.707s">was</a> whether or not we had standing, not whether or not use variances exist in the city of Medford or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5727.688s">What</a> we appealed was whether or not we had standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5730.169s">And</a> then we went through that appeal and we negotiated a settlement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5733.39s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5734.11s">So</a> ultimately the history is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5736.651s">The</a> legislative history clearly shows what the intent is of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5740.612s">And</a> we have a solicitor's opinion that comes well before the council took these votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5745.593s">So</a> I leave it up to my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5748.634s">I</a> move for approval of the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5750.543s">Mr.</a> President, I don't think that, you know, presenting facts to the Zoning Board of Appeals based upon the legislative history of this body and the opinion of the city solicitor does anything other than reaffirm our position on use variances and let them know where we stand so that moving forward, we're all working in concert with the intent of the Zoning Act.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5802.877s">Actually,</a> to clarify, Mr. President, I'm referring to the council vote that was taken on paper 18376 by roll call, which passed with supermajority. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5810.595s">You</a> know, um, the legislation passed, this body passed a resolution, that resolution reaffirmed the solicitor's opinion and corrected the scriveners that were in the codified version of our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5822.246s">I</a> mean, I don't know how much simpler it has to get than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5825.729s">Um,</a> that action took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5827.251s">It</a> hasn't been undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5829.073s">That</a> action hasn't been undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5830.454s">So</a> just because there's been turnover on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5833.123s">doesn't</a> mean that the action's undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5834.745s">That's</a> like saying, because we passed an ordinance five years ago and the body's changed, the ordinance doesn't count anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5839.952s">That's</a> not the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5841.334s">The</a> body acted, the body passed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5843.056s">That</a> was the legislative intent at the time, and that should carry through until it's changed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5872.185s">Because</a> the Zoning Board of Appeals doesn't create public policy, they execute it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5875.81s">The</a> Medford City Council creates and establishes public policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5878.914s">That</a> policy's been established and the Zoning Board of Appeals is using their discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5882.625s">to</a> say, no, you can't bring an application before us when they can't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5888.467s">Are</a> they a violation?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5890.788s">I</a> think that the Zoning Board of Appeals made an error, an error in judgment that's opened the city up to liabilities by refusing to hear an application for an individual that's applied for a use variance based upon the legislative history and the solicitor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5902.353s">Yes,</a> I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5903.153s">I</a> feel as though they made an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5904.493s">And</a> that's why I put this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5906.074s">And</a> that's why I took the time to research the legislative history so that we'd all understand that this is how it went down.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5948.515s">Yes,</a> it clarified the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5950.556s">The</a> solicitor gave us an opinion that said that there was a scrivener's error in the codification of the ordinances that happened in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5956.559s">The</a> city solicitor has produced a document from August 12, 2016 that includes history of his research. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5964.79s">Part</a> of that history is an email exchange between the solicitor and the MuniCode company that we use to codify our ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5973.173s">And</a> if you go through that email, you can see the history and the back and forth, MuniCode even saying that it's an error, that use variances are allowed and never should have been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5983.116s">So</a> there's plenty of documentation backing up the fact that the codified ordinances that were done in 2001 contained a Scribner's error relative to use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5992.819s">We</a> asked for clarification, we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=5995.802s">We've</a> adopted the clarification as law in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6026.014s">I</a> just want to make sure, Mr. Not taken that way at all, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6104.15s">No,</a> it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6105.751s">We've</a> actually moved to correct the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6108.652s">However,</a> the codification last occurred in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6112.974s">Based</a> upon the meeting that we had just an hour or two ago, the next step that this council is going to take going forward with our zoning reform would be a recodification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6122.099s">At</a> that time, I think that this error would be addressed anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6125.736s">However,</a> in the meantime, we have applicants that are applying for use variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6129.8s">They're</a> not given their day in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6131.341s">They</a> deserve the right to a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6132.602s">Whether</a> they get denied or not, they shouldn't be told they can't apply and that they can't present their case. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6136.565s">They</a> should be given the opportunity to present their case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6142.37s">Well,</a> it's up to the Zoning Board of Appeals insofar as whether or not they have the authority to issue the use variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6147.805s">With</a> the zoning board saying we don't have the authority to issue the use variance if we had the legislative body is saying no you do Because our legislative history and the intent of the acts they should do there's a problem.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6165.189s">By</a> way of the vote on paper 1 8 3 7 6 we addressed it those we addressed those two conflicting sections We adopted the list of his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6173.13s">There's</a> no longer two conflicting sections.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6291.378s">Mr.</a> President, based upon the conversations that we had last Wednesday evening, the financial picture in this community is grim. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6299.22s">I</a> think it's incumbent upon us as city councilors to make sure that we are informed as best we can be when it comes down to the current financial circumstances that are facing this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6310.182s">We've</a> seen our private outside <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6312.981s">can</a> help you get revenue forecasts of what to expect for the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6317.523s">One</a> of those things is an $8 million budget shortfall at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6321.865s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I put several resolutions on this evening on similar subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6326.847s">And</a> what they are is to get information to this council so that we can sit back and begin to craft an informed decision that we need to make on whether or not we're going to pass a budget this year and what that budget is going to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6339.063s">On</a> top of that, Mr. President, we need to take a look at certain aspects of our service delivery and identify what's important and essential to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6345.931s">And</a> I think that based upon the circumstances that we've all faced, no one can shake a stick at the fact that our public safety personnel are going above and beyond during these trying times right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6355.503s">They're</a> essential workers that have been out there on the front lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6358.833s">So,</a> I'd just like to see what it is our current staffing levels are, our budgeted staffing levels are, and our minimum staffing levels are to ensure that as we move forward and we face these trying fiscal times, that we do our best to secure as many positions as we can in the public safety realm so that moving forward, we know that the residents in this community are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6377.758s">I</a> think that, you know, we've all said it before, the number one priority and the number one goal and objective as an elected official in this community is making sure our streets are safe and our community is safe, and we can't do that without <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6387.441s">public</a> safety personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6389.322s">I</a> ask my council colleagues to support the results.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6397.647s">Mr.</a> President, I would say paper 20345, paper 20346, paper 20350, and paper 20351 are all of similar subject matter and can be consolidated.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6414.608s">I'd</a> ask that you wait for read paper 20350 last Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6489.084s">When</a> we go back to last Wednesday evening's meeting and we met with our private outside consultant responsible for auditing here in the city of Medford, he also provided us with some revenue forecasts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6501.933s">And</a> I was very impressed with the presentation and the level of preparedness that Mr. Roselli brought to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6508.978s">Mr.</a> President, one of the things that he said that I took away that evening was that he is confident that we can start a budget discussion by <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6517.688s">June</a> 1st and have a budget by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6521.409s">He's</a> given us revenue forecasts that are very conservative. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6524.95s">And</a> moving forward, I think it's important that we work as hard as we can to put together an annual fiscal year budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6534.713s">I</a> know there's been a lot of talk about a one-twelfths budget or a quarterly budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6539.815s">And</a> I don't think that that's the way to go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6542.516s">In</a> these discussions that we had on Wednesday evening, we talked about what approach we were going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6548.258s">And</a> there's a question as to whether or not we want to take a wait-and-see approach Wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the federal government wait and see if we're going to get bailed out by the state government We have revenue projections from private outside consultants that we're paying money to to give us revenue projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6562.527s">We</a> have them I feel as though it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6564.888s">Mr.</a> President that we take the bull by the horns That we move forward and we control our own destiny and don't wait for a bailout <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6573.314s">If,</a> in fact, we're going to be facing trying fiscal times, then we need to take the bull by the horns. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6579.298s">We</a> need to do things the Medford way, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6581.9s">And</a> sitting back and playing the wait and see who's going to bail us out approach is not the Medford way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6588.404s">If</a> that were the Medford way, Mr. President, we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to have a transit-oriented smock growth development. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6598.353s">If</a> waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we certainly wouldn't have been able to purchase the grounds where Homel Stadium is for $1 and a land transfer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6608.857s">If</a> waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been able to get our applications in early enough to get a 90% reimbursement on the construction of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6618.342s">If</a> waiting to be bailed out was the method way, Mr. President, then we wouldn't have been the first community in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to establish a linkage fee <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6627.273s">So</a> I think, Mr. President, as we move forward, what we need to do is put together a budget, a 12-month annual budget, where we make hard decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6635.997s">God</a> forbid we have to go forward with those projections that have been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6641.139s">God</a> forbid. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6642.179s">Because</a> there's going to be a lot of cuts, and those cuts are going to cut deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6645.761s">But</a> we have revenue forecasts right now that give us a worst-case scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6650.643s">So</a> we should be putting together an annual budget based upon the worst-case scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6654.733s">If,</a> in fact, our funding comes back from the feds or the states better than we anticipated, then we have an influx of cash and we'll be able to fill the gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6662.418s">On</a> Wednesday night, we did have a significant discussion relative to where the administration is in the preparation of their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6669.963s">COVID-19</a> caused the government shutdown beginning on the 13th of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6675.888s">We</a> were scheduled to meet the first week in April on the budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6679.77s">That</a> was two weeks before the government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6683.136s">I</a> doubt the administration was going to be able to put together an entire budget in two weeks, which would lead us all to believe that there was some work being done in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6690.318s">The</a> city administration has actually confirmed that every single department in the city has presented the administration with their working fiscal year 21 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6701.582s">These</a> documents have not been consolidated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6704.683s">There</a> is going to be a need for trimming. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6707.144s">Obviously,</a> there are many competing needs in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6710.427s">But</a> we're at the spot right now where we have worst case scenario revenue forecasts, and we have a budget based upon the projections prior to COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6719.61s">I</a> think we all want to deliver services at or better than the level that we're at today. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6726.772s">So</a> with that being said, we have a budget that will allow us to do that, that hasn't been consolidated, but East Montgomery has presented that to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6733.894s">And</a> we have forecasts, what the money is going to be from our private outside consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6738.442s">So</a> I think, Mr. President, we're in a position where we can put together a 12-month annual budget for the upcoming fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6744.15s">It</a> might not be a pretty budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6745.652s">It's</a> going to be something that might require some tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6750.018s">But</a> at the end of the day, like Councilor Mack said, a budget's made up of 85% salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6755.563s">So</a> cutting a couple of water coolers isn't going to cut the mustard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6758.244s">We</a> have $8 million to fill, and we've got to start doing it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6761.905s">And</a> sitting back and waiting to be bailed out by the Feds is not the measured way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6765.426s">If</a> it were, we wouldn't have seen the successes that we've seen in the past, and we wouldn't have been able to weather the terrible fiscal times that we've seen in the past, like back in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6773.137s">Quite</a> frankly, here we are 12 years later, we really haven't recovered from the 2008 cuts that have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6778.241s">Look</a> at our DPW and the staffing levels there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6780.643s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we need a 12 month budget moving forward for fiscal year 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6786.148s">And</a> I asked my council colleagues to support this consolidated amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=6790.451s">And</a> moving forward, I look forward to working with them to solve some of these fiscal concerns that we have here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7149.201s">I</a> certainly agree with certain aspects of what Councilor Marks said. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7152.722s">One</a> of them being we need to see what the administration's working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7155.865s">And</a> at Wednesday night's meeting, that's why I requested that the administration provide us with the copies of those departmental budgets that they've received thus far, so that we can see how far along in the process they are in establishing a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7169.87s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, general law would say that the administration is required to present the council with a budget by the 170th day after the organization of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7180.194s">So</a> if you see that we have an inauguration, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7185.799s">Administration,</a> 170 days, budget to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7188.92s">That's</a> what the division of local services, state law says surrounding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7193.021s">So,</a> you know, while the council doesn't necessarily get involved in producing a budget, if in fact we don't receive a budget by the 170th day, by law, we have the right to establish our own budget and put our own budget together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7204.325s">We've</a> never done that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7205.826s">We've</a> never done that before in the history of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7208.646s">Never</a> done it before, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7211.479s">Difficult</a> times call for difficult measures and drastic times call for drastic measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7215.022s">I'm</a> not recommending that the council put forward its own budget and send it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7218.686s">What</a> I am saying is that we need to be on the same page moving forward and then we have to have an expectation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7223.99s">And</a> that expectation should be that we have an annual budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7667.788s">I</a> mean, I understand where council of business is coming from because ultimately taxpayers in this community deserve to have services and service delivery is what we're here to perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7677.632s">But</a> at the same time, borrowing our way out of a financial situation and creating a structural deficit, not only for this upcoming fiscal year, but for fiscal years in the future and establishing a bonded debt for us to pay down for operating costs is <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7695.08s">That's</a> scary to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7696.941s">That's</a> really creating a structural deficit and relying on reserves or borrowing in order for us to operate our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7703.125s">Granted,</a> like you said, 100 years, Great Depression, one out of every five people is unemployed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7710.129s">Actually,</a> in the nation right now, one in every five. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7713.031s">When</a> you look at it, you can't close the door, but we also have to be very cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7718.154s">We</a> can't borrow and spend out, borrow and deplete our reserves in order for us to get <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7723.257s">the</a> situation, the financial situations, the financial situation, the numbers of the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7728.439s">So</a> I commend the Council of thinking of outside the box solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7733.581s">However,</a> borrowing our way out of a structural deficit, I think is something that's scary to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=7739.924s">But</a> I rest with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8208.567s">No</a> one's asking for a wish list budget from the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8211.968s">What</a> was represented at Wednesday night's meeting last week was that, I believe the quote from the chief of staff was that we have a fiscal year 21 working budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8224.667s">It's</a> not a wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8225.928s">It's</a> a fiscal year 21 working budget based upon the revenue forecast at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8234.711s">So,</a> you know, it's not a wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8238.513s">Now,</a> this coupled with the fact that, I mean, I can go back now, I've done several budgets and going back to Councilor Penta asking for wishlist budgets every single year is a resolution for a time that I was on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8252.019s">I</a> recall these requests have been made in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8254.967s">Um,</a> but I'm not asking for a wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8257.092s">I'm</a> asking for the budget that was prepared for the working budget that was prepared for FY 15 based upon the government shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8265.184s">So</a> just to clarify that point, I apologize for the family interference.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8312.757s">that</a> he said, I don't think this information will be helpful to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8317.218s">And</a> as the person that has to make the decision, I think it would be very helpful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8321.499s">But</a> again, we never requested a wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8324.539s">The</a> question was asked to the mayor, where are you in the process right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8327.68s">Government</a> shutdown happened on or around 3-13. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8330.401s">Two</a> weeks, we've been April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8332.941s">We</a> were scheduled to start our meetings on April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8334.881s">So</a> where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8335.982s">And</a> she said, all the departments have submitted their budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8339.962s">I</a> haven't had a chance to review them and consolidate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8343.01s">Okay,</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8344.771s">I</a> said, so we have a wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8347.292s">That</a> was a quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8348.073s">So</a> we have a wishlist budget for each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8350.074s">At</a> which time the chief of staff said, no, we do not have a wishlist budget for each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8354.776s">We</a> have a fiscal year 21 working budget for those departments based upon the forecast prior to COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8363.56s">So</a> this isn't a request for wishlist budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8365.301s">This</a> is a request for the budget, the budget that was prepared by the department heads and should COVID-19 not have happened, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8371.26s">we</a> would see where we are absent the crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8373.221s">Now</a> we have the, so we'll have a budget here that says, you know, in a perfect world without COVID-19, this is what we needed to meet our goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8380.526s">Here</a> we are with the revenue forecast. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8383.208s">Here's</a> the budget based upon these revenue forecasts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8385.61s">These</a> are the gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8386.91s">How</a> are we going to fill them?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8431.229s">I</a> can read it, but I can't move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8433.411s">Mr.</a> President, there was a motion made to consolidate the papers to one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8437.994s">With</a> paper 350 controlling. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8441.517s">So</a> it would be paper 20-350, and then the other papers underneath it, all financial matters, all requesting information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8714.213s">Um,</a> I do believe in recent weeks, Mr. President, the council also put forward a paper requesting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8745.771s">Yeah,</a> just a few weeks ago we requested an update relative to the runoff issues in front of Citizens Bank as it related to that project as well and I'd just like to reiterate that request as part of this result.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8759.315s">It</a> doesn't have to be an amendment I just think that you know it's a request that's been made so if we can just send them the previous document that was approved by the council again because we haven't gotten an update that would be helpful.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8960.147s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8962.189s">First</a> and foremost, I'd like to commend Kevin Bailey and Danny Folk on the work they're doing during these trying times in the recreation department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8970.694s">It's</a> very difficult to establish recreational programming when you can't have anybody in the same place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8976.711s">And</a> they've been doing a great job pursuing various aspects of socially distance and online recreational opportunities for individuals in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8985.935s">And</a> I'm hoping that we can make a few suggestions to the gentlemen in the recreation department moving forward to implement for the betterment of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8994.8s">I</a> think that, you know, here we are approaching day 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=8998.534s">Many</a> of us are getting stir-crazy with, you know, being trapped in the house and in the backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9003.438s">There's</a> not much opportunity for us to go out and pursue recreational opportunities that aren't passive in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9010.764s">And</a> we've seen a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9014.307s">take</a> place to bring some of these services online. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9018.209s">And</a> it's been met with a measure of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9020.811s">It's</a> been met with certainly some enthusiasm in the community, and I'm hoping that we can take this momentum and build upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9028.535s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I commend <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9031.056s">the</a> efforts of the recreation department and the work that they're doing and thinking out of the box to bring services to the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9038.359s">And</a> because they're doing it in a virtual setting, they're able to do it in a way that's at a significantly low cost to the taxpayer and the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9063.268s">Celebrate</a> a birthday party, birthday but can't have a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9066.31s">Stuff</a> like that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9067.651s">So</a> I'm hoping that my council colleagues will support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9072.294s">Once</a> again, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9072.895s">Once</a> again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9073.415s">I</a> got to call the governor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9074.696s">I</a> want to see if he can lend me his guy, just in case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9666.49s">Mr.</a> President, I also raise the question, if in fact, you know, we had a 10-year trash contract that was extended for the period of time, when was it that <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9678.342s">The</a> other condo associations in this community have been contacted relative to whether or not these bulk pickup and recycling services are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9686.525s">If</a> they refused these services 15 years ago and they haven't been asked again, I think that will be problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9693.088s">The</a> taxpaying residents in this community, they should have access to the services that are provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9697.85s">So</a> just because they've opted out at one point in time, I guess the question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9702.278s">To</a> what frequency is the city requesting or monitoring this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9705.523s">I</a> mean, the contract's a 10-year contract, so would it be, you know, they don't come back and ask for 10 years?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9715.416s">It's</a> all by request?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9719.995s">So</a> it might make sense then for the DPW to do an outreach if in fact I'm gonna get a Maple Park, which I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=9728.382s">The</a> question is, you know, do we make sure that everybody understands that they have the option to do this and extend to them the same olive branch that we're extending Maple Park or the same courtesy that we're extending Maple Park to be sure that they're aware that they have access to these services if they've in fact denied them previously.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10301.098s">Also,</a> Mr. President, yesterday, there was a tragic fire on Canal Street in West Medford, and a number of families have been displaced from this fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10313.302s">So</a> I'd ask that the city administration and the school department <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10317.439s">report</a> back to the council as to what steps are being taken to help these families out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10321.622s">It's</a> my understanding that we've seen GoFundMe pages that have been created and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10329.327s">But</a> in times like this, the community needs to come together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JBgoiGlSfTo&t=10332.889s">So</a> I'm hoping that if there's an action plan or if there's any resources available to these families that we'd be provided with notice so that we can take the appropriate steps to help out in any way that we can.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_f5vBHpQjllA/2024-11-19_f5vBHpQjllA.html">City Council 05-05-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=152.389s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=153.99s">I</a> think this is a rather self explanatory ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=157.413s">Here</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=159.91s">two</a> thirds of the way through the second quarter of the calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=165.214s">Within</a> the first five or six meetings that the city council assembled we had requested draft ordinances related to a number of issues that are <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=175.948s">impacting</a> our community, issues that we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=179.929s">And</a> the council initiated as prerogative to look at these by way of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=185.231s">And</a> we had a discussion about whether or not the council would have the right and ability to hire its own attorney to work on this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=194.395s">And</a> here we are, some almost five, almost six months later, Mr. President, and we still haven't gotten one draft ordinance back. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=201.517s">So,</a> I bring this resolution forward asking that we get monthly progress reports from the administration as to the status of the requested draft ordinances that the council seeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=213.144s">And</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=238.606s">Council</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=240.567s">Mr.</a> President, I do think it's important that we also get a copy of the contract that was signed with KP Laura I believe we requested that a number of occasions and we still have not received that yet to determine what the scope of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=252.67s">So</a> moving forward we know what resources are available to us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=260.53s">I</a> am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=261.612s">It's</a> a resolution that's been offered a number of times in the past and has gone unanswered.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=320.588s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=323.41s">Although</a> technology is wonderful, it's not so wonderful sometimes when we're trying to conduct the efficient operation of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=331.616s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think that we're at a point right now where we understand COVID-19 and the coronavirus to ensure that we're protected and meet in a non-virtual setting to address the very important issue of the city's finances in the upcoming budget for the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=350.465s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=353.448s">Although</a> virtual meetings are great, I don't think that they have the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=463.741s">Ultimately,</a> the way I envisioned it is that we can all be in a room. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=468.466s">conducting</a> the business of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=469.847s">And</a> if individual residents have questions or concerns, I do believe based upon your leadership, we've been able to enable some video conferencing in certain areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=479.131s">And</a> I think that could transcend over to the little theater or to other aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=483.393s">Our</a> community media center is very successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=485.394s">Patrick</a> Gordon's done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=487.415s">He's</a> an award-winning producer that we have over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=489.536s">So</a> I'm sure that if we put our heads together, we'll be able to come up with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=493.392s">But</a> if we look at the resolution, the resolution is to ask the President and the Mayor to meet and discuss ways that we can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=499.618s">So</a> I think we should have everything on the table, Mr. President, and come up with something that works for all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=686.783s">Mr.</a> President, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=689.385s">I</a> live, I can see that gate to the cemetery from my front stairs, and the amount of volume of people that are going through there is tremendous right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=699.471s">And</a> when you <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=702.873s">see</a> the faces, they're not familiar faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=704.754s">We</a> have a lot of out-of-state license plates parking along, out-of-city license, out-of-city stickers, out-of-city people parking along Placeland Road, utilizing the cemetery for open space because the parks and their communities have been closed down too. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=717.764s">You</a> know, we utilize it quite frequently for passive recreation purposes, but it's getting to the point now where I've had discussions with operators of heavy equipment that work in the DPW that have said that they're being approached <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=732.635s">by</a> people saying, can you not drive the bulldozer down this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=735.937s">Cause</a> I want my kid to ride the bike down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=738.498s">You</a> know, they have a job to do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=740.319s">So</a> I too echo councilor Caraviello's sentiment statements and I support his resolution wholeheartedly and second it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1228.833s">Mr.</a> President, if I may?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1231.994s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1233.335s">I've</a> gotten to know Mike over the years, and I'll tell you, he's just someone you like to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1238.517s">He's</a> a soft-spoken guy, a gentleman, and I really just want to congratulate him on his 32 years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1246.198s">and</a> wish him all the best as he pursues his golden years. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1250.641s">I</a> think it's important to point out that right around the same time that Lieutenant Endicott retired with 32 years of service, he also turned 65 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1261.408s">So</a> Mr. President, that'll tell you that half of this gentleman's life was spent providing service and public safety to the city of Medford and its residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1272.316s">So</a> that's something that's certainly commendable, and I wish him all the best moving forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1503.768s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1506.31s">I</a> thank Councilor Bears for bringing this measure forward and him bringing up the Courtyard nursing home and the circumstances surrounding that raised further concern and, you know, with everything that's going on in the community and all the discussions and talks and rumors about what's going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1527.468s">I</a> think it's important that we really take a long, hard look at the circumstances and situation that's been surrounding the courtyard nursing home. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1535.974s">You</a> know, from what I understand, I think the Holyoke Soldier's Home has the highest rate of infection for nursing homes in the state, and the courtyard isn't too far behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1548.081s">It's,</a> you know, my understanding that various federal and state entities have reached out <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1554.792s">some</a> help and some planning to prevent the further spread of COVID and were turned away. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1561.437s">Rumors,</a> I don't know if there's any truth to it, but we had the chief of staff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1564.599s">Maybe</a> he can, you know, explain to us a little bit about what circumstances had happened, when and where, who knew what, when and what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1572.705s">The</a> latest I heard was that the Army National Guard had offered its services to help with the circumstances at the courtyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1582.152s">And</a> then the, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1583.911s">volunteerism</a> was refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1586.112s">Um,</a> and I think that, you know, we really need to take a long hard look at it, but first and foremost, um, you know, I'm not one that usually chases rumors down and we have the cheapest staff this evening with us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1596.254s">So</a> hopefully you can put it into that, uh, you know, rumor mill discussion that's been going on around the community, because if that is factual, then it's very concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1604.996s">Um,</a> so with that being said, Mr. President, I do raise the question, um, you know, what's, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1610.05s">what</a> circumstances are going on at the courtyard that the city has been involved in, and what steps have been taken to help them address the issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1620.538s">And</a> was any state or federal body extending help that was refused by the administration of the city during this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1629.305s">Those</a> are the questions that I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1630.726s">Maybe</a> Dave can help us out with this a little bit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1784.769s">Mr.</a> President, I thank Mr. Rodriguez for that breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1789.551s">I'd</a> like to propose a B paper requesting that the administration provide us with a timeline of events and a breakdown of those discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1797.279s">relative</a> to what services and assistances were offered and which ones were accepted and rendered. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=1805.204s">And</a> I'd offer that in the form of a B paper, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2745.475s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2747.416s">I</a> certainly agree with Councilman Mox that a level funded budget would be a win. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2751.639s">In</a> fact, I think at this point in the game, it's wishful thinking to get a level funded budget for the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2757.163s">And</a> that's the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2760.545s">There's</a> also another reality of the situation, Mr. President, and that reality is that by law, we need to pass a fiscal year budget by July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2768.63s">In</a> order for us to do that, during these trying times, we need to stop meeting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2774.093s">We</a> can't wait any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2776.113s">We</a> were supposed to meet last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2778.534s">Uncontrollable</a> circumstances have arisen. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2780.795s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2782.476s">But</a> here we are now, another four weeks behind where we should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2785.797s">I,</a> as one councilor, am not crazy about the idea of going down the road for a 1-12 budget or an emergency budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2794.381s">I</a> don't think that's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2796.181s">I</a> don't think that's the way we should handle a fiscal crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2798.462s">I</a> think that's short-term planning, not long-term planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2801.624s">So</a> I, for one, would like to ask the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2805.07s">will</a> we have an annual budget as required by the state law for us to debate and vote upon by July 1st? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2818.44s">So</a> that's my question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2820.041s">Will</a> we have a budget available for us to vote on at this point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2825.826s">And</a> where are we in the process right now in terms of the preparations so that we can better work our schedules around <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2832.388s">what</a> to expect in the forthcoming weeks when these budget hearings do start. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2837.673s">So</a> I offer that the form of a question to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2840.375s">It</a> can be done by way of a mentor, by way of an answer from the gentleman that's here in the audience this evening, I represent the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2950.829s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2951.29s">Cots</a> all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2952.905s">Mr.</a> President, I request we get that response in writing if possible, just so that we can have it on the record as we move forward and are all prepared so that we're all on the same page when we begin our budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2966.249s">In</a> terms of Tony Roselli now, his position with the community as outside auditor, is that what it is?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2982.69s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=2982.991s">So</a> is it common for an outside auditor to establish new forecast municipalities?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3035.862s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3037.263s">It</a> is common that the answer is commonplace for outside auditors to provide revenue forecast for municipalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3043.364s">To</a> assess correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3045.704s">To</a> assess, okay, thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3052.425s">That</a> does it for me, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3054.406s">I</a> do have one more comment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3061.123s">And</a> I think it goes back to what Councilor Monk said with a level funded budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3067.569s">And</a> I've stated that I think a level funded budget is going to be wishful thinking based upon the current financial and fiscal situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3077.958s">But</a> then we also have to look at the term level funded budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3080.961s">And</a> what is a level funded budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3083.263s">A</a> level funded budget is taking the money we gave last year and giving it to them again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3088.328s">But</a> something's getting lost in the middle there, Mr. President, and that's a measure of the performance and whether or not the goals and objectives were met or established when we made that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3099.778s">So</a> if we're funding a department that says these are our goals and objectives for this term, we give them the money to do that, and they don't meet those goals and objectives, why are we funding them at the same level? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3112.369s">It's</a> obvious that they haven't been able to accomplish the job, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3115.776s">So</a> I think we might want to look at something what's called zero-based budgeting, which means that instead of level funding a budget every year, the goals and objectives that are set are either retained or they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3127.706s">And</a> the money that is appropriated is not a reoccurring appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3133.17s">We</a> need to show that this money in this investment is giving us a return. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3137.473s">So</a> I think that that's something that we might want to consider and might want to look at, Mr. President, is going to a zero-based budget at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3145.019s">You</a> know, we're in very strange financial times, but I think that, you know, with the amount of talent that we have here in the community, we should be able to put together an annual budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3161.253s">I</a> have no more, that's really it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3298.979s">Mr.</a> President, I would just like to add that maybe with this new enlarged donation of PPE that the city has received, that the administration would be willing to set some aside with the intention of being able to provide that when we conduct these in-person budget hearings, if, in fact, it's something we can work out if people don't have access to that stuff, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3321.675s">So</a> that we can use that as part of our ancillary and secondary plan to provide PPE to individuals while we try to meet <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3329.564s">non-virtually</a> for the important issue of discussing with community scientists.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3595.482s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3597.144s">As</a> we are all aware, the school department is one of the largest city departments that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3602.751s">It</a> comprises nearly 30% of our budget annually, and it proves to provide one of the most vital services that we can offer as a municipality along with public safety and public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3614.964s">The</a> challenge that we as a city council face is going to be balancing the many competing needs of the various departments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3625.657s">in</a> being able to deliver a level of services that meets the quality and expectation of our taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3633.779s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think there's been a reoccurring theme this evening about the topic of discussion, and that's the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3643.441s">It's</a> our city's finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3645.182s">And</a> that's the underlying theme of this evening's meeting, Mr. President, and these papers that have been brought forward are no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3651.704s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli and I were <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3653.867s">I'm</a> very aware of the commentary that took place at the school committee meeting, the emergency school committee meeting last Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3660.629s">I</a> quite frankly think if we were going to discuss the city's finances in such a large scope, that discussion should have started with the council and not the school committee, because it's really going to come down to all of us working together on, but the council holds the purse strings and the buck stops here. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3678.347s">Um,</a> so I really think that this discussion should have started with the council, Mr. President, but we are where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3684.288s">Um,</a> so with that being said, there were several resolutions, um, that, that I put forward some by myself, some, um, as co-sponsor with councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3693.31s">And</a> then the speech is going to be the same for them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3695.471s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3696.471s">Um,</a> ultimately, you know, we have a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3699.952s">Here</a> and that job is to balance the competing needs and the competing interests that the various departments have. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3706.333s">and</a> then meeting that objective, delivering those services to the level that our residents and taxpayers expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3713.657s">So</a> I think this information will be very helpful as we move forward in putting together our budget and preparing for our budget discussions, because we'll have a, you know, historical understanding and a historical perspective of the issue that the school department, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3729.913s">largest</a> department here in the city has been looking for, where appropriations and expenditures have been made historically, what the trends are, and then maybe we can take a look at, Mr. President, coming up with some solutions to stop the bleeding when our state aid numbers come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3748.819s">It's</a> my understanding that the new education funding formula doesn't help Medford that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3756.422s">You</a> know, we're not <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3757.462s">not</a> much better off than we were under the old education funding formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3761.883s">So</a> with that being said, I think that it's important that, you know, we take a long, hard look at the finances of our largest departments, first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3770.906s">If</a> we're going to be moving forward and, you know, looking at hopefully level funding budgets, I think the first place we need to start is public safety and public works in our school time. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3781.408s">And</a> then we can go from there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3783.269s">We</a> have many needs right now in the community and many obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3787.513s">whether</a> it be debt service, whether it be health insurance, premium inflation, unfunded pension liability, and the like, we are going to have to comply with the state and federal funded and unfunded mandates and pay the assessments on the certain and various services that we receive from our partners in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3806.283s">So</a> with that being said, this paper that's before us right now, paper 20339, paper 20337, the same goes <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3815.708s">for</a> all three, and I won't have much to say on those, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3818.83s">I'll</a> rest my case with that, with this, that, you know, we need to get this information so that we can move forward and be prepared to address this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3827.355s">I,</a> as one Councilor, am prepared to roll up my sleeves and get to work to put together a 12-month budget for the next fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3834.5s">I</a> hope the administration shares that goal and that objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3838.872s">And</a> as we collectively, I think we'll be in a better position to sit down and really talk numbers and talk to her.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3861.905s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=3863.566s">I</a> raise the issue right forward, and I defer to my colleague, Councilor Scalia,
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5663.841s">President,</a> if I could just make a brief announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5669.005s">I</a> just was driving down Main Street just this afternoon, as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5675.97s">I</a> also drove down Main Street on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5678.793s">And</a> if you go past Bob's Food Store and you look to the house immediately to the right-hand side of it, it's reminiscent of a Tony Lucci sidewalk sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5691.71s">is</a> furniture all over the place, a bed, a mattress, a couch, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5698.215s">If</a> we look at the calendar, Mr. President, Friday was the first of the month. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5703.859s">So</a> that would lead me to believe that there might have been a little bit of a tenant move out that occurred at that address. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5709.704s">And</a> I took the liberty of reaching out to Mr. Bavuso after hearing from <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5716.885s">Some</a> neighborhood residents expressed some concern relative to it being a trip hazard and a safety hazard, and he will be out there tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5725.392s">So</a> I just wanted those individuals that have expressed concern to understand that there is some follow-up that's going to occur tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5733.078s">And</a> the residents of South Medford should no longer have to take a look at that disgraceful, blatant trash that's on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5741.784s">And</a> I've expressed to Mr. Bufuso, if in fact it comes down to a circumstance where the city has to move it or there has to be a clean it or lean it situation, that I as one council would certainly support whatever measure that we can take to help appropriate funds to make that necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/f5vBHpQjllA&t=5759.49s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, code enforcement officer will be out there tomorrow working on rectifying the situation for neighbors of Billings Avenue.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_9xgbSMjoV58/2024-11-19_9xgbSMjoV58.html">City Council 04-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1788.62s">But</a> so I get the question I have is if this contract was put out to bid contract supposed to be appropriated and funded when signed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=1820.368s">That's</a> it for now, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2217.061s">I</a> think it works better with my camera off, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2223.692s">I,</a> as one member of the council, am a firm believer in getting the shovels in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2227.816s">I</a> think we do need to get this sidewalk work done and I think we need to live up to our contractual obligation that we made some time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2236.183s">So</a> I certainly have no problem supporting the funding for this paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2241.087s">I've</a> continuously held true to my position that I do believe we need to focus on eliminating the extensive use of private contractors and <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2250.453s">really</a> turning this work in-house because I feel as though what we're doing is we're really in a race to the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2257.217s">We're</a> not investing in our own personnel and our own institutional knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2262.42s">We're</a> giving all the control and direction to a private company that we're throwing money at. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2266.763s">We've</a> all spoken at length about when a private company gets a public contract, how they feel as though they've hit the lottery. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2275.275s">and</a> the work product sometimes isn't as good as we'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2278.959s">And</a> we've also seen that there's not much pride in workmanship. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2283.823s">When</a> you have an individual that comes to work every day, 365 days a year, like our DPW workers have been doing, especially during these trying times with COVID-19, I think we understand how valuable a resource our DPW is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2299.488s">So,</a> with that being said, I do think we do need to take a long, hard look at continuing to reinvest these privately spent funds, these bonded funds especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2309.073s">I</a> mean, ultimately, if you look at it, we're going to spend $500,000, we're going to pay it off over 15 years, and we're going to get 200 sidewalks out of the deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2316.817s">We</a> could save $500,000, and we could hire employees, and we could have them work for us for the next 30 years, the same amount of time we paid off the bond for just these 230 sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2327.848s">So</a> I do think it's important that we do look at that issue, but this evening I am prepared to vote in favor of funding the contract.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2984.588s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2987.289s">We</a> all know that the Maturanas are a great Methodist family. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2989.61s">They've</a> been around for a long time, whether it be with Pop Warner or right now with our very own licensing commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=2996.121s">Jimmy</a> comes from a great group of people and a great family, and he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3001.823s">However,</a> Mr. President, I think that I would be remiss in speaking before Councilor Scarpelli on this, especially whereas he and Jimmy grew up together, when Morris and Park played around kids together. <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3012.865s">So</a> with that being said, I defer to Councilor Scarpelli.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3184.702s">I</a> don't think I could do any justice compared to what Councilor Scarpelli just said, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3476.537s">I</a> believe it's the next item on the agenda, isn't it, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/9xgbSMjoV58&t=3485.565s">Do</a> we need to suspend the rules, too?<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc/2024-11-19_U2DHdo_mFTc.html">City Council 04-21-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=512.594s">Mr.</a> President motion to suspend the rules to take communications from the mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=686.865s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=688.647s">If</a> I do recall properly, I do believe this would be phase three of a three-year plan for sidewalk restoration that we have funded previously, but I may be mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=703.06s">I</a> was hoping maybe there'd be a representative from the administration here to discuss a little bit further as to this loan order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=731.462s">I'll</a> allow my other council colleagues to type it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1198.717s">Mr.</a> President, motion to report the questions out to the administration for an answer so that we can address the people next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1236.206s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=1236.766s">Commercial</a> break and after these messages, they'll be right back.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2064.052s">No,</a> I mean the rate on the loan, the $500,000 loan that we're looking to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2107.584s">And</a> who are our financial advisors, are these the same entities that we've been using in the past, or is this a new entity or a new consultant that's been brought in?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2213.784s">What</a> would the term, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2215.427s">of</a> the loan B for the 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2217.788s">I</a> believe 20.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2330.275s">My</a> intention was to take up both papers under suspension when I raised the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2339.741s">Yes,</a> but yeah, community preservation papers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2412.887s">The</a> first question that I'd have, Mr. President, is whether or not these appropriations and programs that we're funding would service 100% Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2424.092s">Because</a> community preservation funds are generated through an assessment on our property taxes, I think it's very important that we make sure that these funds stay within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2433.355s">So</a> I ask that question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2488.572s">Mr.</a> President, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2491.034s">From</a> the presentation, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2492.835s">Cameron</a> referred to limit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2495.357s">And</a> when you say limit it, limit what? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2497.499s">Limit</a> the expenditure of CPA funds or restrict the expenditure of CPA funds under this program?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2644.951s">I</a> certainly can appreciate that, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2646.712s">Cameron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2648.754s">Like</a> I said, my concern is that because these funds are generated from an assessment on property taxes from residents here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2661.441s">These</a> funds really should stay within the confines of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2664.282s">I</a> don't see why we should be sending them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2666.884s">If</a> we were going to be producing housing inside the community, and other people were going to be eligible to have access for it, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2675.168s">It's</a> another thing if we're taking money and funding a program that's going to be servicing people that don't live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2681.271s">And</a> I think that's what my concern is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2716.552s">So</a> there's no guarantee that this money is going to service Medford residents?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2725.054s">That's</a> the only guarantee we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2728.515s">If</a> we spend it, there's a guarantee that Medford residents could be left out, and they won't be able to have access to this, and it could go somewhere else outside.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2748.262s">Apparently,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=2749.142s">Cameron</a> is going to let other people answer the questions, so that's fine with me, absolutely.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5137.429s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5139.389s">I</a> have two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5141.55s">The</a> first one is, I'm not sure who said it in their presentation, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5145.221s">but</a> I believe the term was we invited them to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5150.683s">And</a> I'm wondering if that is, you know, there's an open enrollment period or an emergency enrollment period and they're saying, look, if these resources are available, please apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5161.475s">or</a> if this is a, hey, we know a great organization, let's call them and tell them to apply for this money, because this is a program we need, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5168.582s">Is</a> the community and the community-based organizations driving the request for the program, or is the CPC driving the request for applicants?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5287.314s">I</a> don't want to be misunderstood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5289.615s">I</a> certainly understand the work that these organizations do and I appreciate the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5294.216s">My</a> biggest concern is taking property tax dollars and these monies that are <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5299.101s">generated</a> through an assessment on a property tax here for a homeowner and them having the opportunity to be used outside of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5306.003s">That's</a> my biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5307.644s">That's</a> my biggest issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5308.584s">But</a> it seems like a lot of those concerns have been addressed with the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5317.107s">One</a> question I would have for our CPC administrator or CPC staff is, does the council have the right to reduce the appropriation and allow this applicant to come back at a later date for further funding? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5329.384s">Councilmarks</a> made a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5330.785s">If</a> the need's not there, then these funds could go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5334.348s">Why</a> release $250,000 when we could release $75,000 now, $75,000 later, and then $100,000 at the end if that need needs to be met? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5337.71s">Is</a> it in our best interest to <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5348.51s">appropriate</a> 50% of our CPC funds that are in the affordable housing bucket at this time, or should we give less money and allow them the opportunity to come back and ask for more if the need is there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5552.247s">The</a> last question I have, I think the chief of staff is on the call, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5556.51s">What's</a> the mayor's position on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5557.771s">Is</a> the mayor supportive of this appropriation, or is this something that the mayor doesn't see as appropriate? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5563.396s">Does</a> this fall within our housing needs and use plan that we have in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=5567.219s">Those</a> are the questions I'd have for the administration if they can answer that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6742.979s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to second Councilor Caraviello's motion for a 50% funding and then upon review of the usage statistics, a further conversation on appropriating the additional 50%.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6856.936s">They</a> made the recommendation for the funds of 250. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6859.497s">We're</a> just giving them half and saying, come back and ask for more later. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=6862.419s">They</a> made the recommendation for 250.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7389.085s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7391.388s">Many</a> of us know the Miller and family, they've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7394.247s">fixtures</a> in the city of Medford for as long as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7396.709s">Very</a> dedicated community advocates in their neighborhood at the West Medford Community Center, in the state working for individuals with developmental disabilities, and also very active in the Democratic Party here in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7412.442s">Henry</a> and Evelyn have become great friends over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7415.104s">I</a> first met them working in Charlie Shannon's office when they'd come up and lobby for state funding for certain programs in Madison at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7422.549s">I'm</a> very happy to have seen the friendship grow, and I'm very happy to see them have 50 years of wedded bliss under their belt, and I wish them 50 more, and I ask my council colleagues to join me in offering this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7454.17s">It</a> was an arranged marriage.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7939.532s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7941.733s">I</a> do think it's important that we continue to keep on track with the pre-budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7948.175s">And</a> the reason I say that is because statutorily, we still have to produce a budget, you know, by the 1st of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7955.558s">And</a> I do not believe that the governor has extended the period of time in which the municipality can put together its budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7963.682s">So</a> I think by law, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7965.749s">The</a> mayor would have to give us her budget by the last day of next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=7972.175s">So</a> I just hope that we can keep on a tight schedule with this, Mr. President, because there are going to be a lot of tough decisions that need to be made.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8149.441s">Go</a> to the meeting, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8512.498s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8514.96s">I</a> had the opportunity to work with Senator Shannon at a very young age. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8519.042s">My</a> first foray into politics at age 19, my first big boy job, working with Senator Shannon up until his passing in 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8525.705s">I</a> remember walking into the office on my first day and as an intern and sitting at the desk next to me was Consulate Kaviello's son, Richard. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8536.121s">So,</a> you know, I go way back with the Caraviello family. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8539.024s">Richie</a> and I were in kindergarten together, and we interned for Senator Shannon together. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8542.947s">Councilman</a> Mox worked for Senator Shannon as well for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8545.969s">But</a> he's someone who I give a lot of credit to for helping me professionally and personally, and he is sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8553.115s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in offering condolences to a gentleman that offered so much to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8559.399s">He</a> served in the state legislature, elected in 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8563.652s">passing</a> away in 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8564.453s">He</a> had served quite a bit of time for the residents in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8569.856s">He</a> did an excellent job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8572.457s">Senator</a> Shannon was probably one of the best constituent service providers in the state legislature during his time as a state senator. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8579.801s">And</a> that is something that is a legacy that you will want to be remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8583.623s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8788.331s">Yes,</a> just recently we have lost Paul Brogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8793.133s">Mr.</a> Brogan loved the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8795.194s">He</a> had the blue and white running through his veins as they'd say. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8798.896s">The</a> father of our cemetery commissioner, Steven Brogan, <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8802.783s">grandfather</a> to Haley Brogan in our clerk's office and also grandfather to Stephen Brogan in our DPW, Stephen Brogan Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8809.926s">in</a> our DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8811.987s">The</a> gentlemen, the Brogan family, Mr. President, has long and deep roots in the city of Medford, a great family <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8818.473s">made</a> up of public servants, people that'll be willing to give the shirt off your back. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8822.615s">But</a> one thing we can always say about Paul Brogan was he loved the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8826.696s">He</a> wouldn't be afraid to tell you about it and that he will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/U2DHdo_mFTc&t=8829.797s">So</a> I'd like my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution and offering our condolences to the Brogan family who have been involved in the governance in the city of Medford for quite a long time.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_xiD5galYT24/2024-11-19_xiD5galYT24.html">City Council  04-14-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=710.818s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=713.518s">I</a> would have to echo my colleague's sentiments relative to Mr. McGonigal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=719.3s">He</a> was a great gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=720.28s">I</a> had the opportunity over the past decade or so to get to know him rather well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=725.721s">And</a> he was a really good guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=727.521s">He</a> had a great sense of humor, a great sense of wit, and a great understanding of how government is supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=734.102s">And</a> he wasn't afraid to tell you if he felt as though you were doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=738.963s">and</a> more so if you were doing a bad job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=741.785s">So</a> with that being said, Joe was a great guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=743.946s">He</a> was certainly a gentleman who had a great way and a great approach to life. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=749.269s">And</a> his memory will live on down in the city clerk's office with his portrait. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=756.613s">commemorating</a> the years of service that he had dedicated to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=760.837s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to join my colleagues in extending my deepest and sincerest condolences to his family and for the gratitude for lending him to us for the better part of five decades.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=944.224s">Mr.</a> President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 20314 out of order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1146.883s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1149.125s">This</a> is something that I've looked into quite a bit since my election to the Medford City Council, and I do understand that there are certain state laws and state parameters that guide public utility companies and what is required of them and what is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1167.355s">I,</a> earlier in the day, had forwarded an email to the city clerk proposing a B paper amendment to this proposal that's before us, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1178.057s">And</a> that B paper amendment would be that, be it resolved, the Medford City Council request the city administration establish a policy requiring that all street opening permits, my phone just shut off, so I lost it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1192.14s">Technology's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1197.116s">All</a> street opening permits to be accompanied by a neighborhood mitigation agreement that will adequately adequately and reasonably offset the negative impact on the quality of life caused during street opening construction and city neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1210.925s">So,</a> Mr. President, what we see here, if you look around the city of Metro right now, Garfield Ave, Sheridan Ave, Golden Ave, Main Street, Central Street, Woburn Street, National Grid or other public utility providers have ripped up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1227.213s">They're</a> storing their equipment on our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1229.854s">They're</a> storing their supplies on our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1232.675s">They're</a> causing detours in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1234.596s">They're</a> putting parking restrictions in for three and four weeks at a time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1238.798s">And</a> that's causing an impact to the quality of life of residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1241.879s">But</a> we'll take Golden Ave, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1244.32s">Now,</a> I've probably put forward 25 to 30 resolutions asking for Golden Ave to be repaved, resurfaced, potholes fixed over the course of the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1255.365s">Now,</a> just recently, Devereux Corporation, on behalf of National Grid, closed down Golden Ave for a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1261.947s">I</a> mean, a week, rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1262.907s">And</a> they did the work that they had to do in the trenches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1268.05s">and</a> did a great job Mr. President they run quite an operation actually they're very efficient, but the potholes on the street is still there there is still broken sidewalk panels on the, on the sidewalks there is still tree stumps that need to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1281.103s">And</a> I think that it might be reasonable for us to request <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1285.607s">a</a> mitigation agreement to address some of these concerns in the neighborhood to offset some of the quality of life issues that come with these street construction permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1295.253s">For</a> example, Mr. President, if they're asphalting the whole entire stretch of Golden Ave, is it too much to ask for them to take out a couple of broken sidewalk panels and replace those panels with asphalt until we can get to them with concrete? <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1306.721s">I</a> don't really think it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1309.162s">And</a> the mitigation agreement can be reflective to the scope of work that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1316.205s">So</a> if there's a small project that's being done, we can only ask for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1319.646s">If</a> there's a big project that's being done, we can ask for a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1323.448s">But</a> I think that this is something we really need to look at long and hard, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1327.089s">We've</a> all been talking now for the better part of a decade about <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1332.371s">what</a> we can do to hold public utility providers accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1336.895s">And</a> I think this is one way we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1338.737s">I</a> commend Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Marks for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1342.721s">And</a> I also thank the city engineer for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1346.364s">That's</a> why I motioned for this paper to be taken out of order because I saw that he was here and I really am looking forward to some of the comments that he has to make relative to this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1356.214s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I would make a motion to join that as a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1360.376s">I've</a> already forwarded the language to the city clerk and all the members. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1363.237s">So</a> with that being said, I rest.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1598.955s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1600.63s">I</a> do believe state law dictates the requirements that are necessary and mandated for these public utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1606.898s">So</a> I think it would be important for us before we take a vote on this to hear further from our city engineer relative to those scope and specifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1614.948s">But</a> from what I understand, I think I want to say the project is like <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1619.246s">SWOP</a> or something like that would be the acronym that was used to, I'm going to mush this, get out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1627.672s">The</a> acronym that would be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1630.715s">I'll</a> look it up in the meantime, but I think we should allow the city engineer an opportunity to speak on this before moving further. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=1638.32s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2187.537s">Tim,</a> that process where the public utility contractor, or as Councilor Bears, the quasi-public utility contractor, when they do a temporary patch <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2205.987s">and</a> then contribute the funds to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2209.048s">That's</a> a program that's outlined by state law, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2241.1s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2245.981s">So</a> in terms of curb to curb, that's one aspect of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2253.663s">The</a> B paper, when a utility contractor is working on a street like Olden Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=2262.631s">You</a> know, there's been a lot of people that have been killed 15 times over the... Sorry, Councilor Knight, you're breaking up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3257.786s">No,</a> on the paper Mr. President, and speaking with the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3263.628s">Do</a> you feel as though this is something that's feasible and something that's attainable that you can work out a neighborhood mitigation agreement with these contractors that are seeking a street opening permit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3304.936s">And</a> I mean, you know, ultimately we have to look at it both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3308.798s">The</a> work that they're doing in our community is work to improve our underground infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3313.74s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3314.02s">I</a> mean, we have gas leaks going on all over the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3316.621s">We</a> need to have national grid come in and take the steps that they need to prevent these gas leaks from continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3321.783s">You</a> know, we've all gone on record saying we don't want any level two and level three gas leaks in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3327.025s">And</a> we want a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3329.847s">I'm</a> going to say it out again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xiD5galYT24&t=3342.83s">Well,</a> I'm not going to beat the dead horse, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_uJXvTXEl5kY/2024-11-19_uJXvTXEl5kY.html">City Council 04-07-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=900.568s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem with this paper that's before us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=904.329s">I</a> live right down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=906.19s">It's</a> a very tough location, and I wish you the best of luck there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=908.93s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=910.11s">However,</a> Mr. President, I do feel it will be appropriate for us to put a condition on the special permit that would grant the extended hours to the business, but not to the property address. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=927.254s">So</a> in case there is a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=929.735s">that</a> application. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=934.118s">The</a> next business would have to, or the successor business would have to petition the council for extent that it operates as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=940.963s">So</a> that's the amendment that I'd often misrepresent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=946.647s">It</a> would be a conditional thing that goes with the business, not the property address. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=953.992s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=993.561s">I</a> was not, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1333.05s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem raising the deferment cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1337.292s">This</a> is something that we talked about back in 2019, I do believe as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1344.096s">The</a> question that I do pose is this, is this paper offered in the proper form for us to adopt it this evening, or is there specific length which required per the division of local services that needs to be adopted in order to raise the cap?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1468.503s">Just</a> a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=1469.203s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2717.815s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that this is nothing more than giving our retirement board flexibility and an option to make a determination as to whether or not we want to divest from fossil fuels in the investment of our public pension funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2734.886s">Because</a> our public pension investment bodies are <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2739.369s">Um,</a> autonomous in nature, legislative action will be necessary because the retirement board is telling them they need to get a return of a certain amount, whether it's 7% forecast, 6% forecast. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2750.478s">Um,</a> we're not getting that return. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2753.401s">We</a> can't tell them what to invest in and then expect them to make a return. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2756.523s">So</a> that's why this legislative authority is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2760.246s">This</a> does nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2761.107s">It</a> doesn't mandate that we divest. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2762.948s">What</a> it does is it gives us the opportunity to pursue it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2765.57s">Um,</a> and if our community has values that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2769.065s">reflect</a> this lack of reliance on fossil fuels and a move towards green energy, a move towards being carbon neutral. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2777.772s">I</a> think this is a tool that we want inside our toolbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2781.595s">So</a> I don't think it's going to hurt us any just to support the legislation, Mr. President, because it's still going to allow our retirement board to make the decisions that they made them in the past, but it's going to give them a little bit more flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=2791.843s">So</a> it's something I'd be willing to support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=3961.369s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=3963.091s">This</a> paper was offered by way of an amendment to, I believe, a paper that we took up last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=3975.322s">So</a> the matter is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=3976.303s">It's</a> been sent to the administration already. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=3977.864s">I</a> move for withdrawal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4028.461s">Sorry,</a> Mr. President, I'm having what they call technical difficulties. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4033.985s">What</a> self explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4035.986s">Aaron's</a> a great person she runs a great business down there in Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4040.068s">She's</a> very involved the arts community allows many, many local artists to display work in her shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4046.192s">But</a> Mr. Coffee Roses has been around now for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4049.033s">It's</a> amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4049.573s">I</a> remember when it first opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4050.914s">So</a> time certainly flies when you're having fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4053.535s">They</a> run a great business and I'd like to congratulate Sharon and her staff on all the success that they've had in the past and for another 10 years of success in the future, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=4063.318s">I</a> ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5275.354s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5277.956s">Ultimately,</a> I think this is just a request to share information. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5282.08s">I</a> agree with Councilor Marks in that regard, is that the council, from time to time, whatever the issue may be, not just coronavirus, whether it comes to something as simple as street sweeping or <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5295.851s">road</a> work that's being done in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5298.333s">We</a> want the residents to know what's going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5301.396s">But</a> I think the most important thing is that we deliver a consistent message across government, between the school committee, the council, the Board of Health, the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5313.025s">We</a> need to deliver a consistent message, Mr. President, because if we don't, it's irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5317.949s">So</a> that's the number one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5319.35s">I'm</a> all for sharing information with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5320.911s">I'm</a> all for doing reverse 911s. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5323.273s">I'm</a> looking at it and saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5325.415s">at</a> $0.21 a postcard to the 20,000 households in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5328.998s">I</a> mean, we can get out of this relatively cheap if that's what our intention is to do, is to mail an information sheet to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5335.563s">It's</a> something that's going to be relatively inexpensive, a drop in the bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5339.206s">You're</a> looking at $182 million budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5342.648s">So</a> with that being said, I think that the most important item in this whole entire discussion is that the message is delivered as a consistent message across all levels of government so that the residents in this community understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5356.474s">I</a> can't tell you how many calls I got from people saying they didn't think they have to pay their rent on April 1st after last week's meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5363.157s">I</a> mean, so it's dangerous when we're delivering a message that's not consistent across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5368.759s">is</a> all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=5369.64s">So</a> I think it is very important moving forward, Mr. President, that the message is consistent and in lockstep with that of the administration in the school.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6876.766s">Mr.</a> President, I will say that it's going to be a very long term for the Medford City Council if we debate every single bill that's filed at the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6885.293s">In</a> terms of the paper that's before us this evening, I think we've talked this item up quite a bit, and I would move for a vote on the topic.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=6931.522s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President, maybe in the alternative, you can type his question into the chat icon down below and we can read it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7147.843s">I'm</a> just wondering if the sponsor of the resolution spoke with the administration and asked for clarification prior to filing the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7161.366s">So</a> the administration has banned the showing of these units or they haven't?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7178.15s">Right,</a> and in the conversations you've had with the administration, did they clarify at all, no? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7183.634s">Not</a> yet, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7185.335s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7225.412s">I</a> was asking Councilor Caraviello whether or not they had taken a position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7231.548s">Yeah,</a> I just- Talking to another city clerk.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7293.493s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7295.514s">Mr.</a> President, at this point in time, I think this is where we are beginning to tread into murky and dangerous waters where we're going to start delivering mixed messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7305.638s">I</a> think it's important that the administration address this issue because the administration is really responsible for the enforcement of the executive order. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7312.581s">They're</a> the body of the government that has the tools and the responsibility to execute and implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7319.004s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd be very cautious. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7323.227s">going</a> down this line of questioning if we're not all on the same page and have consistent answers because we're going to be giving mixed messages similar to what happened last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7332.855s">So</a> I just want to be very clear, Mr. President, that I think that we're treading down the wrong path at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7338.74s">And</a> this might be a topic that needs to be clarified through the city administration very simply with a one-line response to the council, yes or no, it's allowed or it's not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7348.348s">And</a> I think that that will nip this in the bud right now, but when Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7353.369s">Catalo,</a> who's a local real estate agent who has a very successful business here in the community, asks the question, do you have a problem with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7362.211s">Do</a> you have a problem with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7363.172s">I</a> think that that's going to start bringing us down the line of, well, I think this, I think that, he thinks this, she thinks this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7369.393s">We</a> need a consistent message going forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7371.874s">That</a> message has to come through the administration through a clarification of their executive order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7379.059s">And</a> Mr. President, I would ask that this be offered in the form of a motion that the paper be forwarded to the administration for clarification on their executive order as to whether or not rental units are allowed to be shown when the units are unoccupied.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7397.82s">I'm</a> sorry, housing units, not rental units, housing units.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7427.127s">The</a> motion would be to refer the paper to the city administration for clarification on their executive order as to whether or not unoccupied housing units are able to be shown.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7453.3s">That</a> would be a motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7458.742s">I</a> second.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7463.464s">It</a> would be a motion to refer the paper to the mayor and ask for clarification on that question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7593.183s">I</a> missed that whole thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7594.744s">I</a> fell offline.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7885.743s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I'm taking a look and I'm just reading this article that the Councilor provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7895.017s">Um,</a> and it just seems like there's a lot of the stuff that's on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7899.518s">It's</a> just mirrors what's in this article. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7902.359s">It's</a> almost seems like, well, some of all did it, so it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7905.019s">So</a> we should do it here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7906.839s">Um,</a> and I don't necessarily think that cookie cutter approach works. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7909.58s">That</a> one size fits all approach does not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7912.06s">Um,</a> you know, we are a different community that has different needs and different concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7915.621s">Um,</a> so in looking at this, um, you know, I understand what, what the council is trying to do and what direction he's trying to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7924.423s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7925.023s">But</a> I also, again, feel as though the deliverance of mixed messages and the, you know, I don't want to say inundation, but certainly an extraordinary number of resolutions in the past two weeks relative to COVID-19 have been filed and it's creating confusion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7969.087s">Well,</a> I'm not saying that again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7978.078s">Jesus.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7982.48s">I</a> guess Mr. President, the bottom line is Medford is that its own unique and individual community and mirroring what they're doing in neighboring communities just because <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7994.532s">It</a> works there, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=7997.094s">And</a> if we're not going to be delivering a clear and concise message across all levels of government, then it raises concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8004.08s">So</a> I think that we're in a position where we're almost somewhat overdoing it now when it comes to the coronavirus and the resolutions that are being filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8012.266s">Mr.</a> President, I think we really need to have a concise message. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8015.188s">If</a> we all want to get on the same page, I think that the appropriate course of action might be to sit down and meet with the administration, to meet with our Director of Civil Defense, our emergency management personnel, and figure out what's really going on with this situation here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8030.951s">I</a> don't think we've had that meeting yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8032.172s">I</a> don't think we've actually met with individuals from the administration and first responders to talk about where we are in Medford, whether or not we're flattening the curve, what we're supposed to expect over the next 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8043.321s">We</a> haven't had that conversation yet, Mr. President, in terms of the public health emergency and what's happening here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8050.594s">The</a> public health emergency, I think, is the number one issue that we're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8054.778s">There</a> are secondary issues that come along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8057.501s">But</a> at this point in time, I think what we really need to be doing is looking at the impact that the COVID-19 coronavirus is having <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8064.988s">on</a> our community in terms of the ability to deliver services, number one, and what to expect over the height of this over the next 14 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8072.95s">We</a> need to have a conversation with the director of the Board of Health, with the Civil Defense Department, with the administration to talk about these issues so that we have a better understanding as to what's going to happen here in Medford, and then we can take an approach that's going to work for Medford and not try to adopt what they're doing in other communities, because that cookie-cutter approach may not work here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8484.508s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8489.89s">Mr.</a> President, I think, again, going back to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8509.958s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, we want to deliver a consistent message, and that message has to come from the administration when it comes down to how to proceed and whether or not you're allowed to show units. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8521.627s">That's</a> why we're asking for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8523.429s">I</a> think that's the whole motion that's before this council and the whole paper that's before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8528.212s">The</a> question is whether or not we want to ask the administration for clarification as to whether or not housing units that are vacant can be shown. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8534.898s">I</a> mean, that's the paper that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8537.259s">I</a> don't think it can get any simpler than that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8644.689s">I</a> do believe one of the frustrations that people always express with government is the slow pace that it moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8651.09s">However,</a> our forefathers had always thought that creating a process that was slow and deliberate and open and transparent was appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8658.032s">So</a> sometimes experience isn't necessarily the intended or best path. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8663.893s">I</a> can certainly understand where Mr. Hughes is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8666.554s">However,</a> just to put something out there as fast as we can just to get it out there so fast isn't necessarily the best path. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8673.055s">Government</a> is designed and structured to be slow for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8677.179s">So</a> with that being said, I can certainly appreciate his comments, but I did want to point out that, you know, everybody's very frustrated at the pace that government moves, but government moves slow for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=8685.787s">It</a> was designed that way so that it can be open, transparent, and thorough.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9208.263s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9210.285s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9214.326s">We're</a> right now in a position economically where the city of Medford is not going to be afforded the same level of aid that we've received in the past, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9228.769s">We're</a> looking at pretty much virtually every sector of our economy being shut down for a quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9235.471s">That's</a> going to have a drastic impact on the amount of funds that are coming into the state coffers and that are going to trickle down into the city of Medford's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9244.713s">I</a> certainly support increasing the subsidy for raft. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9247.195s">There's</a> no question about that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9249.136s">But</a> one of the things that I think we really need to look along and hard at, if we're going to be asking our state delegation for money, <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9258.61s">in</a> asking our state delegation where to invest money when we're going to come down to a situation where there's going to be a lot of belt tightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9265.477s">I</a> think what we really want to do, Mr. President, is beg for local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9269.52s">Beg</a> for local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9270.802s">Say</a> we want level-funded local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9272.864s">We</a> don't want to see any 9C cuts to our local aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9276.687s">We</a> rely on our local aid, Mr. President, and without it, we're going to see drastic budget cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9282.853s">So</a> in this economic pandemic, these uncertain fiscal times, the amount of financial obligations that the city has related to its debt service, I think it's very important that we balance the requests that we make from the state legislature for money <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9300.769s">are</a> two issues that are going to actually inflate Medford's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9306.452s">Because</a> we're going to be up against, quite frankly, a situation, Mr. President, where I don't see us getting a budget for the next fiscal year that's going to be anything better than level funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9317.838s">I</a> don't see us getting a budget for the next fiscal year <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9321.28s">that's</a> going to fill vacant positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9322.901s">I</a> think those positions are going to be lost to attrition so that we can present a balanced budget based upon the economic uncertainties and the fiscal times that are facing us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9332.647s">So</a> the only thing that I'd say is that, you know, as we continue to make requests from our delegation, that we really look long and hard at what we're asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9340.933s">We</a> don't want to ask for too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9342.213s">You</a> know, they always say you ask for two things and you get one. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9345.015s">You</a> ask for the loaf, and you get the loaf. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9347.236s">You</a> ask for two loaves, and you get one loaf. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9348.856s">So</a> I think that if we're going to be asking the legislature to advocate for certain aspects of funding for our community, that it's funding that actually would inflate the city's coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9359.659s">That's</a> my position on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9360.679s">I</a> certainly support the resolution that the council made. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9363.059s">I</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9367.045s">a</a> meritorious effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9370.089s">So</a> with that being said, I will support the paper this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9372.372s">But</a> going forward, Mr. President, as we make requests from our state legislature to fund initiatives and to fund programs, I think, quite frankly, the first place we've got to start is at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9381.382s">Charity</a> starts at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9382.604s">We're</a> going to need the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9383.505s">We're</a> going to need the money going forward because these <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9387.357s">because</a> of the economic downturn that we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9389.422s">We're</a> not seeing the meals tax, we're not seeing the hotel tax, the city's not seeing the income tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9397.906s">unprecedented</a> amounts of people have been laid off from their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9400.648s">So</a> we're in a situation now, Mr. President, where the money's not gonna be coming into the coffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=9405.032s">So</a> if we're gonna be asking the legislature for anything, it should be money to really inflate what we're doing here so that we can continue to provide at least the same level of services in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10200.527s">Go</a> ahead, John.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10204.85s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10206.47s">I</a> think it's very important to point out that when Mayor Lungo was on the council, she was an advocate for the hiring of a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10216.932s">She</a> was very outspoken about it, and I'm very happy to see that her administration is keeping that $40,000 commitment that the previous administration had made to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10227.214s">I</a> think that's very important, Mr. President, that the $40,000 commitment for a zoning consultant is carried over from the previous administration to this council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10234.992s">I</a> do want to point that out, that there is $40,000 of funds that are committed to this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10240.654s">I</a> would also like to ask the question, Mr. President, this subcommittee meeting was sometime in late February. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10247.796s">And</a> at the time, we had asked for a list of all the consultants that had been hired since the change in administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10253.637s">And</a> I don't believe the council has yet received that documentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10256.558s">So</a> I'd just like to reiterate that request with the approval of this subcommittee report, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10266.489s">And</a> offer that in the form of a motion to the administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10271.911s">I</a> offer in the form of a motion to the administration for an update on that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10321.745s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10322.365s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, as part of that committee report, we did request from the administration a list of all of the consultants that had been hired since the change in administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10332.128s">It</a> was expressed by the chief of staff at that point in time that he would get that to us relatively speedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10337.869s">I</a> did bump into him shortly thereafter and that was the beginning of this coronavirus stuff So I just want to make sure that that's something that doesn't fall by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/uJXvTXEl5kY&t=10346.095s">Mr.</a> President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8/2024-11-19_3EjMDeUU8A8.html">City Council 03-31-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1071.794s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1074.975s">I</a> certainly have no problem with this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1119.816s">Yes,</a> we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1120.877s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1123.118s">I'd</a> just like to make a motion to add restrictions onto the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1126.961s">I</a> certainly have no problem supporting it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1128.882s">However,</a> the special permit should be attached to the business and not the business address. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1133.205s">And</a> also if we could place a 90 day review on it, Mr. President, I'd certainly have no problem supporting it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1860.074s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1862.055s">I</a> think Mr. Husenhoff, was it, from Wright Avenue, had the right idea when he said that this is something that could be very restrictive for our ability to develop accessory dwelling uses and also build upon existing conversions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1876.362s">When</a> Mr. Mulkey appeared before the council some time ago to discuss this, I raised this as an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1882.225s">I</a> could certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1883.846s">see</a> the CD board's position, but at this point in time, Mr. President, I don't feel as though any action is warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=1890.35s">So</a> that's where I will stay on this issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2413.436s">Motion</a> to table the next meeting, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2812.775s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem supporting this measure this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2816.539s">However,</a> I would like to put restrictions upon the special permit, that the special permit goes with the business and not with the property address, and also that we conduct a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=2826.848s">I</a> offer those in the form of an amendment or restriction.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3227.53s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I believe that they came for a common victorless license before they were open. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3233.635s">And</a> because the Board of Health didn't sign off on it, we got some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3237.358s">And</a> they came back with that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3239.479s">We</a> voted to approve the common victorless license. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3243.042s">In</a> the interim, I do believe the applicant had gone to the liquor commission to get a liquor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3248.826s">And</a> now they're back here for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3290.021s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3292.443s">In</a> similar form to the previous Council before us, relative to special permits, I'd ask that the special permit be attached to the business, not to the property address, as a restriction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3304.835s">And</a> I do have some concern about a 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3310.5s">license,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3313.845s">Most</a> of our communities have 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3315.606s">licenses,</a> and I'd hate to see Medford Square being the destination for last call between 1 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3324.271s">I</a> know that in the past we've addressed some of these applications through phasing in of extended hours, similar to what we did at Shanghai Moon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3335.018s">and</a> that's something that we may want to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3338.359s">I</a> do think that a restriction on hours or fading in of hours to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3344.78s">is</a> something that deserves pertinent discussion at this point in time, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3399.587s">The</a> amendment that I made, Mr. President, was a restriction for restricting it to the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3405.932s">If</a> we did a 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3407.493s">license</a> with a 90-day review, I'd certainly be supportive of that this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3410.856s">A</a> 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3411.476s">license</a> or a license later than that with no review is something I'd have a difficult time supporting this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3586.733s">Seconded</a> as amended, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3592.137s">Seconded</a> as amended.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=3598.145s">I'm</a> motioning to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4019.017s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4020.598s">Not</a> too long ago, we appropriated some community development block grant funds for the revitalization of Harris Park to improve accessibility and accessible pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4029.161s">Shortly</a> thereafter, we also spent some Community Preservation Act funds to create a new playground structure and water park at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4039.205s">And</a> with the approval as permitting, we're one step closer to making that a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4043.947s">Hopefully,</a> when construction is done, this public van will be lifted and the community will be safe and everyone will be able to utilize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4051.211s">But</a> at this point in time, Mr. President, this is really putting some of the final nails in the shingles over here so that we can move forward and get this project done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=4059.255s">So</a> I'd move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5114.753s">I</a> said yes, reluctantly, yes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5802.972s">Mr.</a> President, yes, I'd just also like to ask that a representative from the district attorney's office be invited to the committee meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=5836.054s">Representative</a> from the district attorney.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6172.438s">Mr.</a> President, it would be nice to get a copy of House Docket Number 4935. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6176.26s">I</a> think that would be important for us before we take a vote to have an opportunity to read what the actual state legislation does say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6182.282s">I</a> didn't find a copy of that included in our package this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6185.407s">Also,</a> based upon the fact that we don't have a copy of that, and we've just amended the legislation, I'd ask that maybe we table this matter until a date certain so that we have an opportunity to review it and properly vet it, or in the alternative, refer it to the Housing or the Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee for further review, Mr. Perkins, and proper vetting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6215.312s">I'd</a> like to get a copy of the House docket number 4935, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6218.695s">Number</a> two, Mr. President, I'd like to refer it to either the Housing Subcommittee or the Committee on Intergovernmental Relations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6226.422s">Probably</a> the best bet would be the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations based upon the fact that we're really focusing on state legislation, state law here, and less about what we can do in the city of Medford about amendments and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6238.232s">My</a> suggestion, I'd offer that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6274.873s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6276.053s">The</a> paper that's before us is asking actually the state legislature to take an urgent action. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6281.436s">So</a> the amount before us is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6283.097s">The</a> amount before the state legislature is an emergency.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6292.602s">Councilor,</a> you're cutting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6293.842s">Can</a> you please? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6305.564s">I</a> don't feel comfortable voting on something that I haven't had the opportunity.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6328.706s">Mr.</a> President, without a copy of the legislation here before us, I think it would be irresponsible of us to vote on it without properly vetting it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6345.415s">The</a> motion is the motion, Mr. President, referred to a subcommittee meeting into government or affairs alike.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6558.103s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, just that this bill hasn't been only assigned a docket number at this point in time, and until it gets assigned to a committee and the like, we're not going to know who to send this to anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6565.77s">If</a> we want to send it to the committee chair to get it moving, we're going to send it to a committee chair to get moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6569.112s">But</a> what I see here, it's just a docket number. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6571.134s">It's</a> not even a bill that's been voted on yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6573.276s">But</a> with that being said, I do believe that the governor's office or the mayor's office had spoken about real estate showings as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6581.303s">So</a> I did want to talk about that a little bit in conflict with Scarpelli's point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=6584.848s">But</a> either way, Mr. President, the motion's on the table, it's been seconded, I move for the vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7711.995s">I</a> made a motion to refer the paper to a subcommittee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7715.538s">He's</a> made a motion to further amend the paper for a fifth time, striking all the amendments that he's already made and just bringing it right down to the first sentence of his agenda from the first sentence of the resolution, from what I understand.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7782.285s">I</a> certainly have no problem with the gentleman striking the language and moving <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7790.221s">I</a> would have a problem with him removing the amendment that was made by a fellow councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7793.764s">And</a> I'm sure that you would like an opportunity to discuss that opportunity right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7810.517s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7811.257s">Right</a> now, the matter that's before the council would be be a resolve the Medford City Council expressive support file stock and I'm before the 4935. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7818.937s">an</a> act for providing a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures during the COVID-19 emergency?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7853.239s">Mr.</a> President, I'm amenable to the amendments that have been made to the resolution and I would withdraw my motion to refer the paper to Intergovernmental Affairs and replace that motion with a motion for approval.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7982.408s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7984.429s">As</a> we're all aware, many of our public employees still come to work to provide the essential and core services that are necessary in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7991.937s">Um,</a> however, um, there are employees in city hall, for example, or in our school departments, for example, that are reporting to every worker into these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=7999.4s">Uh,</a> but these buildings have not yet been professionally sanitized. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8002.481s">Um,</a> I do know that there are professional sanitizing teams that have been out in the community, um, that have done our fire stations, our police stations and our police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8011.024s">Um,</a> and I'm hoping that we can extend this program to include our other public buildings where employees are currently stationed, even on skeleton cruiser during public employee, uh, public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8019.353s">lockdowns</a> where they're reporting to work and there are topical services that have seen exposure before this lockdown has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8025.695s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's important that we take every step that's possibly feasible for us to protect the workers here in our community that are providing and delivering these essential services. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8034.698s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in asking that all public buildings where employees are currently working be professionally sanitized so the employees working there can receive peace of mind and also the highest degree of safety possible during this time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8240.025s">Mr.</a> President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8241.086s">I'm</a> very amenable to the amendments that have been offered, and I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8245.549s">I'd</a> also like to further amend the paper and ask that the city administration consider deploying the Park Police to enforce the congregation ban that we're seeing in our public parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8256.055s">I</a> drove by Barry Park the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8257.456s">There</a> were two full-quote basketball games going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8259.93s">And</a> it's very difficult to play basketball being socially distanced to six feet apart from 10 people on a court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8266.731s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think there is a need for a little bit more awareness and a little bit more enforcement of some of the implements, some of the tools that have been implemented to prevent the spread and flatten the curve.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8304.405s">Mr.</a> McPherson would be happy to offer that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8307.826s">And</a> I'd like to also thank Jason Law and Annie Law <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8312.642s">from</a> the Malden Asian Community Center who came yesterday and actually donated 1,000 surgical masks to the police and fire department on that behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8320.033s">So</a> I would be happy to offer that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8321.295s">I'd</a> also like to extend the gratitude to the laws for the work that they did in securing 1,000 surgical masks for our public.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8332.206s">I</a> want to be very clear though, Mr. President, and I think it's important to point out that this just isn't about the police and the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8338.33s">Our</a> front line is doing a great job keeping us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8341.532s">It's</a> also about people in the city clerk's office that are coming to work every day in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8346.335s">It's</a> about our school custodians that are showing up to the public school buildings every day and performing maintenance and cleaning work up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8352.559s">We</a> want to make sure those people are protected too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8355.081s">So</a> I don't want them to get lost in the shuffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8357.432s">My</a> first responders are doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8359.113s">Our</a> public safety personnel are doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8361.053s">Our</a> DPW is doing a great job during this trying time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8954.529s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8955.389s">Mr.</a> President, I saw something on method patch about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8959.45s">Um,</a> but about the, the, a letter, but then I also heard Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8963.17s">Catalo</a> talk about the governor's executive order, allowing them to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8966.931s">So</a> I'm a little confused by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8968.751s">Um,</a> I just took an opportunity to try to look up the governor's executive order. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8972.192s">And,</a> um, I really wasn't too successful with my endeavors because my computer's up there running and I was trying to do it on my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8979.143s">But</a> I think ultimately, Mr. President, this is why it's very important that we have a unified message coming from the administration when it comes to this stuff related to COVID-19 and the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8990.513s">I</a> think that we can't be sending mixed signals and mixed information, and it has to come from one centralized source. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=8996.319s">And</a> I think we might be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here when it comes to some of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9001.023s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I mean, I think all of us <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9003.848s">are</a> very concerned about what's going to happen to people in terms of their living situation and their housing situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9009.953s">And</a> we're all well aware of the fact that the role of government is to provide services. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9015.778s">And</a> this is going to be a service that's necessary for the residents in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9019.641s">So</a> I certainly have no problem setting up a housing stabilization telephone line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9024.765s">Do</a> I think that that's something that we have a department for right now in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9028.688s">Not</a> really. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9029.129s">It'll</a> probably have to go through the office
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9039.414s">Is</a> this better?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9048.296s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9049.716s">On</a> my full screen, it goes unstable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9055.857s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we somewhat get a concise and <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9062.746s">and</a> pointed message that's in line with the administration going forward when it comes to this coronavirus stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9069.471s">But,</a> you know, I support Councilor Kavya. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9072.012s">I</a> hope he's uncomfortable with something once another week, and I'd certainly second that measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9076.375s">I</a> don't think it's gonna be anything that's gonna cure the coronavirus in a week that the Medford City Council is gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9081.779s">So</a> with that being said, the Council needs another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9083.92s">I</a> certainly support his position.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9297.748s">a</a> young boy, age 19, when I first started my foray into government work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9303.993s">And</a> what a brilliant communications specialist Mr. Rasky was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9307.415s">Rasky</a> Communications and Rasky Berlin were, you know, paramount when it came to consultants in the political business. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9315.561s">You</a> know, walking around the halls of the State House, Larry Rasky was always someone that everybody stopped and listened to.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9988.917s">Mr.</a> President, so in this, what it looks like is we're getting 72%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=9993.82s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10011.57s">80%,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10012.99s">So</a> ultimately we're making an investment of up to about a quarter of the value of these vehicles and we're getting 75% return on this investment?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10030.898s">Mr.</a> President, sounds like a good deal to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10032.458s">Move</a> for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10230.002s">Actually,</a> can I make a motion under suspension? <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10231.643s">I</a> might make a motion to suspend the rules, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10289.872s">about</a> the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10292.074s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe earlier this evening we had a subcommittee meeting for paper 20-042.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10326.847s">It's</a> almost done.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10361.667s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3EjMDeUU8A8&t=10363.648s">Mr.</a> President, I withdraw my motion to suspend the rules.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag/2024-11-19_WYTf73F7sag.html">City Council 03-10-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1837.486s">I'm</a> on? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1838.506s">I'm</a> on now, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1839.427s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1840.487s">I</a> do know we have representatives from the administration here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1843.308s">In</a> my conversation with the mayor earlier this afternoon, it's my understanding that these two amendments would create classifications that are more in line with the functions and responsibilities that these individuals are performing in their office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1854.411s">The</a> first amendment, amendment A, for director of communications, it's my understanding, would be a reflective title of the position that was held by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1860.573s">Devaney.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1861.435s">under</a> the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1862.976s">And</a> it's also my understanding that the Director of Community Affairs position under Amendment B would be reflective of the position that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1868.961s">Fisk</a> held under the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1870.763s">So</a> what this is, Mr. President, is actually bringing their functional titles to be in line with the duties and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1876.727s">But</a> I won't steal Dave's thunder. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1878.929s">Let</a> him give us a brief synopsis of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1881.631s">I'd</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1905.863s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President, if I may, I spoke with the mayor last Thursday or Friday about the same issue, requested job descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1912.748s">I</a> know she forwarded them to the city clerk's office, and the city clerk had distributed them to the members of the body as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1918.032s">I,</a> for one, Councilor, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1919.224s">I</a> don't see any issue with this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1920.545s">I</a> think that the mayor deserves the right to be able to surround herself with her own team for what she feels is going to make her time in the corner office successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1928.248s">So</a> with that being said, I move for approval of the paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=1930.849s">It</a> is an ordinance, so it's going to have to go through three readings.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3302.403s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3303.624s">And</a> Mr. Bernal, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3306.464s">So</a> what I'm hearing is that ultimately you're coming before us this evening to ask for the tools that you need to necessarily comply with state mandates.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3315.867s">And</a> meet the objectives of the office that have been put forth by the Board of Assessors.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3320.368s">Mr.</a> President, move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3650.435s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3651.677s">I'd</a> like to make a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3653.721s">This</a> is a PACS project. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3655.664s">We</a> are well aware that the PACS department does have a revolving account that's open with modern hardware, I do believe, with a <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3663.001s">do</a> purchase a lot of their paint supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3664.862s">So</a> it might make sense to coordinate with IDPW because I believe we do get some bulk purchasing rates versus regular retail rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3672.586s">So</a> this $3,000 might actually end up being $4,500 if we spend it the right way with some of our in-house contacts that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3679.449s">So</a> I'd suggest that you meet with the PACS Commissioner, Mike Nestor, and speak with him a little bit about whether or not you guys can utilize the account that they have available. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=3689.054s">And</a> use their bulk purchasing to get some of the supplies that you need to get this done But congratulations, wish you the best of luck.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4024.517s">Retabling</a> the public hearing or retabling the vote on the petition?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4032.022s">He</a> left, no he's not, so that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4033.782s">Okay,</a> sounds good to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4312.675s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4313.897s">I</a> bring this paper forward in response to the 223-2020 legal opinion of the acting city solicitor, which responded to a question asked by the President that was prompted from an inquiry from a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4328.412s">And</a> the question was, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4331.519s">Is</a> a paper offered under suspension, is a resolution offered under suspension a violation of the council rules because it's not on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4338.123s">And</a> the question was asked in the broadest of terms and the solicitor answered it in the broadest of terms and the response came back yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4344.586s">Papers</a> that do not show up on the agenda that are brought up under suspension are violations of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4349.669s">Then</a> the solicitor's response went on to go into specific detail about matters that could be reasonably foreseen and matters that could not be reasonably foreseen and emergency matters, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4360.552s">So</a> in an effort to allow us to still raise certain issues under suspension and in review of some open meeting law, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4367.714s">determinations</a> that I was able to put my hands on, one of them being the Oxbridge decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4371.897s">I</a> came up with some language that would allow us hopefully to have the ability to still offer papers under suspension, but still comply with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4379.703s">Because</a> based upon the 310-2020 committee of the whole that we just had, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the solicitor's opinion and what could or could not be offered under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4389.961s">So</a> with that being said, this is an attempt to address the solicitor's opinion and still provide us with the flexibility that's necessary based upon some open meeting law determinations that have been issued by the Office of the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4401.444s">As</a> we are all aware, the Office of the Attorney General is the authority that's responsible for compliance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4407.965s">Any</a> complaints that would be filed against this public body deliberating in violation of the open meeting law would be handled by the Office of the Attorney General, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4415.686s">What</a> I'd like to do is ask that this paper be sent to the city solicitor for a legal review to see if it complies with her legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4423.573s">and</a> get a response back, and then potentially take a look at the way that we do business internally to ensure that we have more transparency, but we still also have the ability and availability to bring papers under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4433.502s">The</a> first meeting of this term, Mr. President, I did put a paper forward requesting that we change the night of our meetings from Tuesdays to Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4439.286s">And</a> the reason I brought that proposal forward was because, based upon the open meeting law, you need to have 48 hours before your meeting to have the notice posted with the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4448.854s">Because</a> our meetings are on Tuesday, weekends and holidays don't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4452.157s">So</a> we need to have to get our agenda out on Friday morning or Thursday afternoon, dependent on whether or not we had a Monday holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4458.12s">So</a> that would only allow us a very limited amount of time to put items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4462.863s">Upon</a> review of items that have been filed on the agenda, it was <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4468.08s">pretty</a> one in every four, every five matters that this council discussed by way of resolution that was getting put on the agenda, was getting put on under suspension and never being actually placed on the agenda and seen by the general public when the notice was posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4481.289s">So</a> this prompts me to bring forward another proposal for rule changes to allow us to be a little bit more transparent, to allow us to have some items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4489.815s">for</a> discussion and deliberation or to put items on the agenda at a future date for discussion and deliberation that come up under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4496.879s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure in moving this matter to the city solicitor's office for a legal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4502.062s">And</a> that's about it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4503.883s">That's</a> the presentation in a box and bow.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4526.834s">This</a> has no impact whatsoever at all on the public participation portion of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4532.16s">This</a> is really just related to council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4534.202s">Only</a> a councilor can bring forward a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4535.924s">Only</a> a councilor can make a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4537.846s">So</a> this only affects the actual conduct of councilors.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4709.233s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe that pursuant to the council rules, every 90 days you can introduce a paper that's been deliberated on and addressed and deliberated to conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4717.436s">So</a> I'm really not too sure what he's getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4720.237s">Ultimately,</a> the city solicitor issued an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=4721.878s">That</a> opinion came out on February 23rd, 2020.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5101.321s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5103.586s">This</a> is an attempt to establish an extended illness leave bank by ordinance for all city and school department employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5109.837s">An</a> extended illness leave bank is a bank where existing employees can donate one of their leave days to a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5117.642s">And</a> if one of their co-workers suffers a catastrophic injury or illness, they're able to draw down upon those leave days if they've exhausted all of their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5125.887s">And</a> there are certain parameters and requirements that are in place to be sure the people that become eligible to draw down these extended illness leave days aren't sick leave abusers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5135.185s">The</a> state has a very similar program, and when I say very similar, I copied the language from Massachusetts General Law Chapter 4, Section 7P. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5143.646s">I'm</a> sorry, Chapter 7, Section 4P, to create this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5147.407s">And</a> then just put in that advisory council language, Mr. President, how we're going to administer this sick leave bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5155.148s">So</a> what I'd ask is that we obviously have a committee of the whole on a piece of legislation that's this wordy with the city solicitor and the director of personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5164.509s">to</a> determine what steps we can take to establish an extended illness leave bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5169.112s">I</a> said that we should first make a 75 day investment in the bank to get it up and running to allow existing employees that are out on extended leave to begin to draw down on the bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5178.857s">And</a> then we can establish an extended illness leave bank advisory council that will be able to come up with rules, regulations, monitor the program and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5189.142s">The</a> Director of Personnel is the Program Administrator, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5192.644s">So</a> this is really an attempt to try to put something in place to do something good for the residents, for the workers here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5198.686s">When</a> you sit back and you think about people that have suffered from catastrophic injury and catastrophic illness here in the city of Medford, you think of people like Richard Lee, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5208.77s">fought</a> a very, very public battle with pancreatic cancer and wasn't able to beat it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5213.456s">But</a> had 40 years of service here in this building, but was still out for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5219.723s">And</a> we talk about someone like Joe Conway or Brian Rabbit, who we all <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5227.22s">stood</a> beside and wished him well wishes when he's going through a very public battle with pancreatic cancer right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5233.683s">This</a> is something that'll help employees that have been good public servants here in the community, that have given their all to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5239.825s">I'm</a> hoping that we can put something in place that provides a protection and a safeguard for these employees, so that if something unforeseen and catastrophic does happen related to their health or their physical well-being, that there's a safety net that's there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5251.17s">We</a> value our employees, and I think that we should make steps to show it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5377.902s">Based</a> upon the language of the ordinance that is proposed, it gives discretionary authority to the extended on this lead bank advisory committee to come up with the regulations to determine what will work for both the workers in the community, what will work for the city in the school department, because we don't want to obviously also have a financial situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5397.97s">It's</a> pretty much, aside from the 75 days that first get dumped into the pool by the government, after that, it's all donated days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5405.738s">And</a> the parameters would be established by the extended illness leave bank advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5409.042s">So</a> no parameters has been established on how many days people can put in? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5413.667s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5415.188s">I</a> believe the language says, and it's right in the second paragraph, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5424.628s">Any</a> employees completed one day of service may participate by donating to said bank any earned, sick, personal, or vacation leave time in such an amount and with such frequency as said regulations shall permit to maintain a sufficient balance in the bank, but not less frequently than annually.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5567.167s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5568.828s">This</a> is a companion paper to the one relative to the rules that we discussed earlier, 20089. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5576.868s">What</a> this paper does is it defines what an order is, what a resolution is, what a petition is, and establishes a process, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5583.03s">Now,</a> we've seen, especially around election time, the inordinate number of petitions that get filed at the rail to discuss issues that aren't necessarily something that requires a council vote, a special permit, a signed reversal, grant a location, and the like, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5597.934s">So</a> only a Councilor can file a resolution pursuant to our laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5601.195s">Only</a> a Councilor can file an order or an ordinance pursuant to council resolutions in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5606.737s">So</a> what this does is it just defines what a petition is, it defines who's an appropriate petitioner and who isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5611.623s">And</a> someone that's not an appropriate petitioner would still have the ability to come up to the council and discuss anything that they want to discuss with the council and appear before the council when the time is right at the meeting, during the public participation portion of the meeting, wherever that may be, because it seems like there's an appetite to move that based upon the discussion that we've had surrounding the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5627.761s">in</a> recent days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5629.102s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, this is nothing more than an attempt to provide a little bit more order, a little bit more transparency, and streamlining the process for the way that we do things so that we don't run into a situation that we discussed earlier in our committee of the whole meeting, violations of the open meeting law and circus-like atmospheres coming up here at the council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5647.068s">So</a> that's the intent of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5649.388s">That's</a> why I'm bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5650.529s">You</a> know, every order and resolution must be endorsed by a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5654.47s">Because</a> the council rules also say that any paper that's on the agenda has to be disposed up to a conclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5660.055s">If</a> someone files a petition, but they don't have official business before the council that requires the council to vote statutorily, it's in essence the filing of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5668.242s">So</a> that should be placed in the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5671.204s">Very</a> similar to the matter that we have on the agenda here this evening, I do believe, under 20099. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5680.352s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5805.893s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5806.874s">Council</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5808.44s">I</a> do believe the term is referred to as bully pulpit, Mr. President, and when you become an elected councilor, you have the right to file any resolution or order that you'd like, and it comes up to the rest of your colleagues to determine whether or not they feel as though that's something that they want to pass on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=5821.244s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the gentleman for coming up here and agreeing with me, and I hope we can move forward on the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6005.071s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6006.092s">I</a> do believe if the gentleman reads down to the next sentence, all of the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda and not assigned to council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6014.599s">So</a> anybody that does file a petition that doesn't comply with the statutory mandates that require council action would then be placed on public participation and still have the opportunity to show up on the agenda under public participation, still have the opportunity to appear before this body and speak just like they have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6030.0s">just</a> whether or not they get assigned a council paper number because it's really filing of a resolution if you're getting assigned a paper number because our council rules require us to dispose of all items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6043.067s">So</a> that's what my intent was, Mr. President, to clarify and streamline.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6319.759s">If</a> the paper doesn't fall within the parameters of what a petition is defined as, then it would be pushed into public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6326.764s">I</a> didn't propose any order of business changes to the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6330.947s">I'd</a> be happy to put something together and offer that next week if you guys want me to. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6334.409s">It</a> seems like I'm on fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6339.072s">But</a> you know it's the plain language reads. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6342.235s">You</a> know if it's not something that the council is required to act on by law It's not if we if it's something that you know if we don't act on it's going to be constructively accepted Then it will go to public participation presentations and all of that can go right to public participation unless they're requested by a council of a council at sponsoring someone to come and do a presentation and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6363.772s">So</a> Mr. President, I think if the council takes a vote to say we want INSTA to come and do a presentation on the pipeline project, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6371.537s">But</a> if someone shows up and says, I want to talk about the Red Sox middle relievers, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6377.16s">That</a> goes to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6379.542s">We're</a> asking someone to come and give us a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.283s">That's</a> one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6381.723s">If</a> someone wants to discuss with us what's going on, that should happen in public participation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6391.795s">In</a> just in looking at the rules when I was reviewing the suspension of the rule stuff and then I saw the petition as well and you know no order or resolution should be <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6401.809s">It</a> can be filed by anybody but a councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6403.531s">So</a> once that paper gets filed and it gets a number on it, that's a resolution number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6407.675s">That's</a> a council paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6409.097s">That's</a> someone filing an ordinance that's not a member of the board or the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6412.52s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6413.181s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6415.303s">Because</a> we have to dispose of all items on the agenda that are given a board number.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6422.898s">But</a> you have to dispose of all items on the agenda, regardless.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6432.546s">That's</a> one way to do it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6494.836s">It</a> streamlines our internal operations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6564.741s">Just</a> as I stated in my presentation, Mr. President, this is more about defining the parameters of what it is that we're trying to do and streamlining the way that we do it so that our meetings don't turn into a circus-like atmosphere and environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6576.176s">You</a> know, the more that we know, the more that we have it defined, the better off we are, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6580.338s">You</a> know, that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6582.239s">There's</a> no nefarious intent here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6584.639s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6585.26s">I'm</a> just trying to make sure that we do things properly and that we streamline things. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6588.221s">We've</a> gotten an opinion from the city solicitor that I think should be given a little bit of attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6592.743s">I</a> think it's, you know, a little bit serious when the solicitor gives us an opinion that says that any time you take something up that's not on the agenda or under suspension, that it's a violation of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6601.446s">then</a> all the talk that surrounded that suspension talk was whether or not people were going to have the opportunity to come up to the podium and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6607.672s">We</a> have a dedicated section in our agenda for people to come up to speak on any topic they want, whenever they want, however they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6614.799s">So</a> I'm not seeing how this is having any impact on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6618.622s">All</a> it is is internal controls for the council and how the council operates.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6626.797s">And</a> I don't think, and I'm not taking that away Councilor at all.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6736.06s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6737.421s">The</a> proposal says that all the petitions filed shall be placed on the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6742.465s">So</a> I don't understand why we wouldn't be able to deliberate on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6744.887s">It's</a> still on the council agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6754.974s">It</a> doesn't matter if it has a number or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6756.675s">If</a> it's on the agenda, it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6757.956s">What</a> I'm saying is that it shouldn't be assigned a number because all papers on the agenda need to be disposed of in one fashion or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6764.619s">Only</a> a consulate can file an order of resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6767.641s">So</a> at the end of the day, if someone files a petition that doesn't comply with the proposed rule change, they get put on the agenda under public participation, the section that it's appropriate for. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6780.558s">But</a> as long as it shows up on the agenda, based on the solicitor's opinion, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to deliberate, discern, or take any further action as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6789.512s">Because</a> it's on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6827.979s">The</a> city clerk is well aware of the fact that, you know, if someone applies for a grant of location, we're an administrative authority, we're a tribunal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6834.881s">So</a> there's an application that's necessary to be filed in the clerk's office for any of these actions to take place, whether it's a grant of location, a conviction was licensed, a sign reversal, there has to be some sort of application action that takes place in the clerk's office to prompt that to come here from an administrative standpoint in government.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6979.917s">Official</a> business matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6982.848s">For</a> example, we had a Kino license that sat on the table for a number of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6987.031s">The</a> Kino license was in our Zoning Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6989.532s">Because</a> it's in our Zoning Act and we're the special permit granting authority, it falls under Chapter 48, Section 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6994.455s">There</a> are actions that we need to take and we need to act in a certain amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6997.597s">I</a> believe the amount of time was 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=6999.698s">Failure</a> to act within that 90-day period results in a constructive acceptance of the Kino license at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7006.322s">If</a> we don't take a vote on it, it's a constructive acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7010.025s">It</a> also opens us up to legal <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7012.879s">action</a> because it's within our zoning act and we failed to act as a special permit granting authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7017.465s">So</a> what I'm trying to do, Mr. President, is delineate items that are under council purview and require council action and items that aren't under council purview and that council can't effectuate. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7028.382s">in</a> terms of taking a vote and it's happening tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7030.545s">You're</a> approved, it's done, expect to have it tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7033.408s">There</a> are certain items that come before this body that we can't do that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7037.132s">A</a> lot of items we're asking people across the hall to do stuff for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7040.216s">What</a> I'm saying is if in fact we're going to have a petition that gets filed, the petition should be for something that requires council action by law so that <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7047.284s">We're</a> aware that this is something that's serious business, that's part of our job, that we're required to take action on. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7052.527s">I'm</a> not saying that public participation is something that shouldn't happen, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7056.77s">I'm</a> not saying that that section should be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7059.092s">I'm</a> not saying that people should not be allowed to participate in public at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7063.314s">What</a> I'm saying is let's streamline the processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7065.116s">Let's</a> define what a petition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7066.657s">Let's</a> say this is what a petition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7068.057s">It's</a> something that requires council action because if we let the ball drop on a petition, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7072.16s">we</a> open ourselves up to certain legal ramifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7074.341s">We</a> have certain obligations based upon the oath that we took, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7077.582s">Some</a> of those things are duties and responsibilities that were required to execute. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7081.723s">The</a> majority of those duties and responsibilities that come before this council that were required to execute by statute of law comes in the form of a petition by way of an application for action by the council pursuant to some sort of established and enabled legislation, whether it be the granting of locations, the reversal of signs, the issuance of convictual licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7100.939s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7101.72s">So</a> all I'm saying is a petition is reserved for those matters that require council action. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7106.943s">And</a> if we don't take it, then we're in violation and everything else can go into public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7111.145s">If</a> someone wants to come before the council and speak, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7113.347s">Come</a> before the council and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7114.788s">Just</a> do it at the right spot of the meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.394s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7174.695s">Point</a> of information, Council Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7176.336s">Rule</a> 33, order of business, item 10, public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7180.578s">It's</a> outlined in the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7181.599s">It</a> didn't show up on the agenda because there is no public participation paper on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7186.38s">but</a> it is outlined in the order of business under rule 33.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7252.11s">And</a> I'm not gonna suggest any, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7258.215s">The</a> filing of petitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7261.28s">shall</a> be reserved for these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7262.761s">All</a> other petitions filed shall be placed in this portion of the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7271.066s">Right,</a> and how many times do you think people fill out a petition that don't actually have the requirement for council action by law that still file the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7280.332s">So</a> someone's going to file a petition, right, and the clerk's going to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7283.274s">The</a> clerk's going to look at it and go, yeah, this isn't something that's required by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7287.316s">Put</a> that on public participation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7461.279s">The</a> way that I envision this, Mr. President, would be Mr. Krause gets up and he's, you know, filed for to be on the agenda during the public participation portion of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7470.301s">Mr.</a> Krause gets up and he speaks about something that he cares a lot about, which would be a scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7475.743s">All</a> right, let's say, you know, we're trying to push for a scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7479.564s">These</a> are the steps we've taken to get the scoreboard at Playstead Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7482.164s">We're</a> looking for the council help. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7484.665s">What</a> can the council do? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7486.525s">Mr.</a> President, motion to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7489.434s">make</a> an amendment relative to motion to make a resolution on behalf of Mr. Crouch's speech that the city of Medford take the following steps to affirmatively secure the school board a place to park. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7500.7s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.04s">You</a> made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7501.9s">Everybody</a> agree with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7502.801s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.041s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7503.381s">It's</a> assigned a paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.301s">There</a> you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7504.922s">Follow</a> up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7506.943s">Councilor</a> just took the council just took ownership of that issue, put their name on it, said, this is mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7511.725s">I'm</a> making this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7512.706s">I'm</a> owning this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7513.266s">I'm</a> putting ownership on this issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7592.499s">I</a> just wanted to say that I prefaced my comments with Mr. Krause, and I said, say that he had put the paper on for public participation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7601.781s">We</a> did it in advance, because we all- What if he didn't? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7604.862s">Then</a> we can't talk about it, because the city solicitor gave us the opinion already. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7608.563s">Regardless</a> of whether or not we change petition or don't change petition, we can't talk about it, because the solicitor already said it'd be a violation of the open meeting law the minute the body deliberates on a matter that's not on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7619.411s">It</a> would still be on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7620.832s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7621.372s">It's</a> on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7622.072s">It's</a> going to be in public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7623.813s">What's</a> the difference? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7624.313s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7625.294s">It's</a> just a different section of the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7627.035s">So</a> if he's on the agenda under public participation, he has the right to come up and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7631.056s">Then</a> a councillor can say, this is my issue and adopt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7633.438s">And</a> then they can take ownership of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7635.218s">You</a> know, instead of having someone comes up to the podium and we're going to have the seven competing people step over each other to see who's going to do the most with this person when we're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7642.782s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7643.863s">At</a> the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7644.663s">And</a> then it dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7645.564s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7646.584s">We</a> can take ownership of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7647.705s">We</a> can say, hey, look. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7648.725s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7649.606s">I</a> put this proposal forward on behalf of Mr. Krause to get $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7653.188s">I'm</a> going to get him the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7654.649s">As</a> opposed to, oh, that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7655.93s">This</a> person was up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7656.61s">I</a> agree with this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7657.37s">I</a> agree with that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.291s">Send</a> it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7658.911s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7659.432s">Send</a> it to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7660.732s">I</a> just think it streamlines the process a little bit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7671.62s">I</a> think independently. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7672.481s">We're</a> a body.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7676.885s">I</a> think I'm an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7678.446s">I'm</a> a member of this body, but I think as an individual.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7896.417s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7897.758s">I</a> echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments regarding Mrs. Moss. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7902.62s">I</a> have the good fortune of being very close friends with Hank and Dennis, and they're two of the finest individuals you'll ever meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7909.223s">And</a> their mom did a great job raising them as a father of two sons, I hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7914.077s">and</a> pray that when my kids reach adulthood that they are of the same character and integrity that Hank and Dennis have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7920.379s">They're</a> two great individuals and they're a certain and absolute reflection of the work that their parents put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7926.68s">So</a> with that being said, I just want to join Councilor Caraviello and hopefully my council colleagues in extending a deep and sincere condolence to the Morse family. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7935.863s">Priscilla</a> will be sadly missed and she did a lot of good for this community and that good carries on in her children and grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=7942.955s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues join me in supporting this measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8104.449s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8105.83s">This</a> is a relatively self-explanatory proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8109.072s">I'd</a> like to refer this to the city solicitor for validation of form and codification, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8113.794s">Where</a> we're going to put it in the ordinance isn't to be sure that it's in proper form. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8117.356s">However,</a> in looking at it, ultimately, there's been a fight for 15 across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8122.719s">To</a> live in the city of Medford and make less than $15, you're not going to be able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8127.199s">to</a> live in the city of Medford and make $15. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8128.7s">You're</a> going to have $15 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8130.001s">You're</a> going to have a very difficult time trying to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8132.783s">This</a> is an opportunity for us to show that we value our employees, that we believe in the work that they do, that we feel as though our public servants provide a high-quality level of service to the community, and they should be compensated accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8145.651s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I raise this measure and bring it forward for further debate and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8150.695s">I'd</a> like to ask that the city solicitor put this in proper form and codification, and then we can, again, reconvene on it upon conclusion of legal review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8211.743s">Lifeguards.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8213.905s">Camp</a> Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8215.526s">Park</a> police. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8216.907s">Substitute</a> teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8218.268s">These</a> are the people that will be impacted and affected by this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8221.05s">People</a> that provide a very valuable service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8225.173s">We</a> talk about lifeguards, it writes point. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8229.158s">pretty</a> happy to say that I haven't heard about any type of situation up at Wright's Pond in a very long time, because we do a great job training our lifeguards up there, and we have full complement to staff, and we want to keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8241.769s">We</a> talk about the parks police, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8244.171s">You</a> know, I can remember a time when I was a child where the parks were crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8249.596s">When</a> the sun went down, the parks turned into war zones. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8252.499s">And</a> now, as you drive through the city and you see the parks in the summertime and the park police are on board, <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8258.311s">We're</a> not seeing those same problems that we used to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8260.873s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's very important to point out who would be impacted and affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8265.275s">It's</a> only city and school department employees, and it's only ones that make less than $15 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8271.218s">During</a> budget deliberations and over the course of the past term, all of the collective bargaining agreements in both the school department and the city side, at one point or another, reached a conclusion and got wrapped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8282.21s">all</a> contractual employees were receiving a wage that was above $15 an hour, with the exception of those few that I've just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8289.334s">So</a> with that being said, I don't think this is gonna be something that's gonna have a major impact on the bottom line, but it will certainly have a major impact on the lives of those individuals that are working here and the employee of the city of Medford, and they're gonna be benefits of a fair wage.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8325.324s">If</a> the Massachusetts minimum wage exceeds $15 an hour, then the employee shall receive the Massachusetts minimum hourly wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8331.629s">So</a> as the state sets it is how our employees will get it based upon this proposal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8346.7s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8347.2s">We're</a> going to let the state dictate and we're going to follow.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8375.154s">Referral</a> to the solicitor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8466.15s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8467.391s">I</a> find this to be a rather self-explanatory resolution, ordinance change rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8471.854s">In</a> looking at it for my council colleagues, the language in bold would be the new language being added to the existing section. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8479.24s">The</a> remaining language in the section would continue to remain in full force and effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8485.044s">A</a> few weeks back, we had some discussion about the removal of a number of parking spots along High Street and <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8491.929s">discussing</a> the issue with residents in the neighborhood that were impacted by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8495.434s">I</a> thought this might be an interesting compromise, a way that we could address some of the neighborhood concerns, but also move forward with the project, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8502.645s">Now</a> with that being said. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8504.591s">I</a> would request that this paper be sent to the building commissioner as well as the code enforcement officer for review and recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8511.394s">Where</a> it's a zoning ordinance, it does have further ramifications than just this 94-151 section. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8518.757s">I</a> know that there's another section on zoning code that talks about what a suitable parking spot would be and what the parameters of that parking spot would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8526.42s">had</a> conversation with John Bovuso from the building commissioner's office and he's asked for the opportunity to take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8533.365s">So</a> I'm requesting that my council colleagues join me in moving forward with sending this to the building commissioner's office for review from the building commissioner and the code enforcement officer for recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8542.431s">And</a> then we can have a future discussion on it after those come back.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8773.802s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8774.782s">May</a> I be so bold, Mr. President, to amend the paper to request that in the discernment, the building department also look at the green space requirements associated with intercourt parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8785.99s">And</a> I offer that in the form of an amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=8789.832s">That</a> the Building Commissioner's Office also review during the discernment the green space requirements.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9231.803s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9232.983s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9234.804s">This</a> has been something that we've been kicking around now for what seems like four and a half, maybe five years, where the mayor's taken a public position that she's going to be recusing herself from the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9245.306s">We</a> have a zoning subcommittee that's ready, willing, and able to finish up the draft and bring it forward to the committee of the whole for future deliberations and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9254.429s">So</a> I'd ask that the council colleagues support this resolution in moving forward with the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=9879.215s">Mr.</a> Cruz, Mr. President, I'd like to call the meeting to order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11135.231s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11137.092s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/WYTf73F7sag&t=11137.272s">In</a> favor of the paper.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=508.101s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much and thank you to my council colleagues for entertaining the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=511.562s">The</a> reason that I asked to suspend the rules this evening is because we have the Mattarese family here who would like to make a public service announcement relative to Rare Disease Day taking place this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=521.505s">So</a> at this point in time, Mr. President, I'd like to ask the Mattareses to come on up and provide us with a little information about Rare Disease Day and this public service announcement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=739.575s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=740.856s">I'd</a> just like to take a moment to ask Mrs. Mattarese to come up here and explain to us a little bit about what's going on this weekend and the work that she's been able to put in to raise awareness for this rare disease on Rare Disease Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=753.789s">There's</a> some pretty cool stuff going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=756.23s">She's</a> gotten a lot of support from residents here in the community, my colleagues on the school committee, the chief of police, the Boston Celtics, and she's really put a lot of work into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=765.393s">We</a> just sat down and spoke a little bit before the meeting, and I'd just like her to tell everybody about what she's been doing over the past several weeks to get everybody prepared for this, because it's pretty amazing what you've been able to accomplish in such a short time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1996.304s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1996.704s">Excuse</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=1997.645s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper just to request that the City Solicitor be available at this meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2358.375s">Mr.</a> President, I defer to the senior member. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2361.241s">In</a> age and service. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2362.602s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2408.851s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I certainly echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2413.233s">The</a> Roach family are fixtures in West Medford at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2416.134s">The</a> store's been open for a decade now, but it feels like they've been around for much longer based upon all the community work that they do, the volunteerism, their efforts and work with the Medford Family Network, for example, donating ice cream every year for the Valentine's Day scoop-off being just one of the many events that they participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2432.84s">Hoops</a> to hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2434.317s">Hoops</a> for Hope, Mr. President, they participated in Hoops for Hope, Medford Community Day, the list goes on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2439.359s">Anytime</a> that there's an event that says Medford up front and they need volunteers, Chucky and Ginny are the first people in line to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2445.382s">So</a> I want to thank them for all that they do for the community, congratulate them on 10 successful years of business, and wish them 10 successful more years because we really need them in this community and we really need them to continue doing what they've been doing for all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2458.108s">So</a> with that being said, I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this matter forward with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2462.757s">And</a> I move for approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2662.938s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much for bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2665.999s">As</a> many of us have been aware in the community of recent weeks, there's been some picketing <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2671.393s">over</a> at the police station for work that's being done, an informational picket relative to a sub-bid that was awarded to a contractor that has a work history of shoddy work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2681.795s">The</a> subcontractor, Industry Solutions Company, is performing the mechanical insulation work down at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2689.616s">They</a> have a work history showing that they were at a public work project in the town of Raleigh, where they performed poor workmanship and were thrown off the job, Mr. President, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2699.179s">So</a> that raises concern and to me because this is a multi multi-million dollar project it's something that we've been waiting on for a long time and we all know that the <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2710.94s">Wrapping</a> of mechanical parts in the mechanical insulation process, as evident by the presentation that was given here last year by Jim Lister from Local 6, Mechanical Insulators Union, shows that if these jobs aren't done properly, they're one of the leading causes for increased energy inefficiencies, but also mold, mildew, bacteria buildup inside your systems, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2734.567s">With</a> that being said, I think it's very important that we have the city auditor conduct a wage theft analysis as well as a compliance check for our responsible employer ordinance to be sure that we have the appropriate parties that are best trained and <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2751.785s">have</a> a proven track record of utilizing taxpayer dollars in an efficient fashion working at the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2757.586s">And</a> that the building commissioner keeps an eye on the work that's being performed down there just to ensure that we're getting the best bang for our buck, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2764.967s">I</a> wouldn't bring this measure forward if this employer didn't have a track record, a track record of doing shoddy work on a public work, very similar to this project that's going on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=2773.949s">So</a> I ask my council colleagues to support the measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3059.487s">There</a> we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3060.547s">I</a> do believe that the petition, the individual would have the right to bring any matter forward that they'd like to discuss at the public participation portion of the meeting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3070.929s">But</a> as of right now, we're dealing with paper number 2077. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3075.53s">I</a> think we're just about ready for a vote on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3078.17s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, maybe we can take a vote on this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3089.603s">Because</a> I think that the open meeting law concerns come into play, Mr. President, not with the commentary of the individual, but with the deliberation of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3096.448s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3096.988s">So</a> we won't be able to deliberate on any of the things that she brings up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3100.21s">And</a> if we choose to do something with it, it would be placed on a future agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3103.953s">But</a> the petitioner can't place something on the agenda and then have us act on it under suspension or otherwise, because only a councilor can file a resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=3128.807s">Did</a> I call for a roll call, Mr. President?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4451.288s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4452.89s">I'm</a> totally confused by this commentary, but are these teenage kids, young kids in the neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4459.155s">Who</a> are these people that you're referring to? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4462.098s">Is</a> it the same group of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4463.419s">Is</a> it a random individual that keeps doing it? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4465.922s">Is</a> it different people in the neighborhood that are performing this?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4488.959s">Is</a> it the same individuals time after time? <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4491.22s">Or</a> is it different faces that you see in different times?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4511.233s">But</a> it's not just kids being kids in the neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4513.974s">That's</a> what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4514.934s">It's</a> not just kids being kids in the neighborhood playing hide and go seek in your backyard or cutting through your yard to get to the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4519.416s">And</a> you're saying that these are grown adults that have video cameras and that are sitting on people's shoulders and looking in your windows?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uIlyuj9UctU&t=4526.6s">OK,</a> thank you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2331.788s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2333.088s">It's</a> always good to see the vape depot being replaced by a gym, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2337.029s">I</a> mean, I think it shows we're coming full circle down there on Salem Street when it comes to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2341.69s">I</a> certainly don't have a problem with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2344.171s">However,</a> where it's a 5 o'clock in the morning application, it does raise some concerns to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2351.632s">So</a> Mr. President, I certainly have no problem voting in favor of this this evening provided that <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2357.067s">We</a> amend the application that the permit would go with the business and not the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2361.671s">And</a> that we put a 90 and a 180 day review on the special permit, Mr. President, to be sure that any issues in the neighborhood can be addressed in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2370.678s">As</a> operations progress and business gets busier and you got half of the city of Medford in there beating down your door wanting to become members at your gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2379.024s">We</a> just want to make sure that the quality of life issues in the neighborhood are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2383.087s">This</a> is common practice, we do this quite a bit where we put a 90 day review or a 180 day review on a special permit application for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2390.811s">And</a> we also make sure that it goes with your business name as opposed to the address so that if you vacate and another entity comes in, that those extended hours aren't grandfathered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2400.537s">So</a> just a little explanation as to what the motions were that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2403.499s">I</a> certainly wish you all the best of luck and don't have any opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2406.593s">To</a> them putting in their personal fitness studio down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2409.254s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2410.134s">However,</a> we have to protect the interest of the neighborhood as well And I think that this is a good compromise.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=2480.297s">Oh,</a> okay.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3148.015s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I couldn't put it any better than Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3152.436s">Ultimately,</a> we have residents that live in homes that are upwards of $600,000 to $700,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3155.997s">They</a> pay property taxes in upwards of $7,000 to $8,000 a year, have vehicles, pay excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3164.68s">God</a> forbid they want to have company over the house and you can't park in front of your own house. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3168.084s">God</a> forbid you have a landscaper or work being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3170.127s">Where</a> are they going to park? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3170.888s">Where</a> are they going to go, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3173.15s">You</a> know, I don't see the need for a path to nowhere, especially when we just spent how many millions of dollars extending a community path one block <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3185.051s">away</a> at Memorial Park with crosswalk right at Auburn Street, crosswalk right at Winthrop Street that runs actually all the way from Medford Square all the way to the Brooks School, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3198.301s">So</a> we actually have a bike path, a community path that's in place now that's been constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3202.323s">We</a> all took pictures next to the sign when they did the ribbon cutting. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3205.205s">And</a> it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3206.126s">It's</a> there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3206.466s">And</a> it's underutilized, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3208.208s">But</a> I think that that's a good compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3209.749s">I</a> mean, ultimately, we have a community path that's one block away. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3213.351s">We</a> have residents in this community that have invested their life savings to purchase these homes, and their quality of life is going to be impacted by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3220.515s">You</a> know, we talk about zoning and ordinances and taking away inner court parking, Mr. President, inner court parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3227.378s">You</a> know, you're not allowed to park inside the front, the inner court of your house, but they'll come down and they'll put a bike lane right in front of your house, and then you won't have any place to put your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3236.302s">So</a> where's it going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3237.062s">It's</a> going to go to Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3238.143s">It's</a> going to go to Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3239.363s">It's</a> going to go to Auburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3240.724s">It's</a> going to go to Piedmont Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3241.945s">It's</a> going to go to... <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3243.246s">All</a> the ancillary secondary roads that people can't find a place to park their car, they're going to put them in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3248.954s">Now,</a> just last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to go to the Brooks School for a wonderful winter concert, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3255.343s">And</a> I think I'm confident in saying that my kids are never going to win a Grammy. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3259.108s">But</a> when I got there, I had to park my car, and it was, there's 100 kids in the Brooks School's kindergarten class this year, and it was the kindergarten concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3268.058s">So</a> there were a number of families that were there, 100 families. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3270.16s">So</a> you can imagine what the parking was like at the Brooks School during a regular school day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3274.005s">I</a> had to park almost in front of Councilor Caraviello's house on Prescott Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3279.268s">to</a> go to the concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3280.469s">And</a> that's with the parking on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3282.911s">So</a> as events happen in our schools, as our school population grows, those spots are going to become more and more valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3289.035s">So</a> I can't agree more with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3291.357s">You</a> know, I think we need to take a look at this and figure out a solution that's a compromise that allows the residents to maintain their quality of life while also implementing the Safe Routes to School project. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3300.544s">You</a> know, a path that starts here and ends there and doesn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3304.107s">I</a> don't see the benefit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3305.808s">I</a> really don't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3675.295s">I</a> think the funding sources are relevant at some point when, you know, well the feds are going to give us a million bucks, so let's impact the quality of life of these residents because it's not tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3686.283s">You</a> know, I mean, the million bucks is the million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3688.605s">They're</a> going to leave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3689.245s">Tomorrow,</a> we're going to be just as good as we were yesterday without it. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3691.706s">You</a> know, things aren't going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3693.127s">The</a> only way things are going to change is if we take it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3695.769s">The</a> only way things are going to change is if we take the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3697.61s">So</a> let's sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3698.871s">Excuse</a> me, I have the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3700.852s">So,</a> Mr. President, ultimately, you know what I mean, I agree with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3704.054s">We</a> need to have a discussion about this, and we need to figure out what we can do to protect people's quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3707.617s">Maybe</a> that's allowing in-accord parking in areas where bike lanes take away parking in front of their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3714.015s">That's</a> an option, that's a solution, but it's something we need to talk about before we start going. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3717.898s">We've</a> already put a bike lane down Winthrop Street, and we have a resident on Winthrop Street that every 90 days is putting an application in before the traffic commission asking them to take it out so we can park in front of his house. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3727.285s">So</a> that's the reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3729.507s">It</a> sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3730.167s">Yeah,</a> we're making everybody safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3731.408s">These</a> bike lanes are making everybody safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3732.949s">No</a> one's ever going to get in a bike accident again. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3734.67s">Not</a> the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=3735.731s">Not</a> the case.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4477.358s">I</a> think we've beaten the horse to death, Mr. President, on this one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=4526.684s">I</a> do not cycle.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5144.725s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5146.367s">As</a> many of us are aware, there was a complete streets project that was started down at Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5152.334s">And</a> it doesn't look to me as though this project is finished, but it doesn't look to me as though there's much work going on down there either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5161.756s">The</a> parking area has not been striped. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5163.799s">There's</a> no shrubbery or any type of ballast or anything like that that I believe were part of the plan that were going to be put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5170.208s">It</a> looks like there's a problem with the gradient and pitch as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5175.096s">It</a> looks like in a rainstorm the. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5178.053s">rain</a> would puddle up quite a bit going down towards the Citizens Bank area of the parking lot over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5184.218s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can get an update from the city administration, including but not limited to the construction schedule, where we are in the process, what percentage of the project is complete at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5197.248s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, if you think about that little Tufts Square area, and you think about all the businesses that were there, it's a very historic area, very important to the heritage and history of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5208.374s">I</a> was just talking to a friend of mine just the other day on Golden Ave, Michael Price, who showed me a newspaper article of Dolly's Beauty Salon down right there in Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5219.199s">And</a> Dolly, his mother, was the youngest hair salon owner ever licensed <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5226.596s">in</a> the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at age 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5229.157s">Mr.</a> President, she was a business owner at age 15 right there in Tufts Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5232.898s">So</a> it's my hope that we can remember the good things of that square and the good businesses and the good legacies that were left behind by honoring them a little bit more with the completion of this construction project, Mr. President, and also when the time is right <a href="https://youtu.be/mbymTt2FVd8&t=5247.235s">Hopefully</a> maybe a history board or a story board down there, but at this point in time I would just like to ask for an update from the administration as to what's going on with the tough square project where we are and When it's going to be complete and what the construction schedule looks like Thank You console night console beers I'd just like to amend this paper to ask the administration also if they have any data or information on the impact of the change in<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_kv8LdhmTAaQ/2024-11-19_kv8LdhmTAaQ.html">City Council 02-11-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1124.708s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1127.979s">We've</a> had much discussion about pre-budget meetings that are going to be coming up, much anticipated pre-budget meetings, I may say. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1135.061s">The</a> question comes to whether or not we have some vacant positions that are available here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1139.782s">I</a> know the council's been talking about its priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1142.383s">We</a> have a priority meeting tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1143.823s">One</a> of our number one priorities is getting legal counsel for the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1148.544s">So</a> in an effort to better understand the financial picture here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1152.685s">and</a> also better prepare ourselves for the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1154.826s">I'm</a> requesting that the city administration provide us with a list of vacant positions that they're looking to fill, as well as a list of the transitional roles and responsibilities that are being covered by whatever department head in the present until such time as those vacancies are filled, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1168.871s">So</a> it's just an effort to gather information so that we can better prepare ourselves for these pre-budget hearings and also make a better case for ourselves to – a better case in terms of what our financial standing is in order to attain legal counsel here for the city council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1346.426s">Mr.</a> President, I'd just also like to amend the paper to request that it be sent to the city engineer and traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1351.807s">As</a> we're all well aware, there are various times the state will come to the city to request certain rights away, permits and the like, to get work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1359.508s">And</a> we can sometimes get mitigation from the contractors that are performing work in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1364.389s">And</a> this might be an aspect where we can negotiate mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1367.19s">So</a> I'd request that we make those two entities aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/kv8LdhmTAaQ&t=1369.753s">of</a> the council's request as well, so that in the instance that an opportunity comes up, we can possibly negotiate some mitigation that this can be something that they can ask for.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_qKKOF8-DbmQ/2024-11-19_qKKOF8-DbmQ.html">City Council 02-04-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3048.055s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3049.156s">I'd</a> like to thank you both for being here this evening and thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3053.039s">You</a> know, Sean's done a great job, I think, of keeping us informed as to what's going on with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3057.203s">We've</a> all been receiving periodic updates, there's no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3060.766s">I</a> think it's also safe to say that the <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3064.233s">Worst</a> is yet to come when it comes to the construction and the impact it's going to have on our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3068.075s">When</a> you're looking at the project breakdown here, we're about 40% of the total project is in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3075.398s">And</a> what do I see here? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3080.66s">5,800</a> feet scheduled for completion along Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3084.141s">Another</a> 1,400 feet on south, another 550. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3088.443s">So</a> there's a significant amount of construction that's going to take place in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3091.744s">And</a> I think really what's going to make this <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3094.136s">you</a> know, the least painful on everybody in the community is going to be this open dialogue and our ability to sit down with other sources on a periodic basis to get updates from them to address the concerns that we have in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3104.429s">They've</a> been very responsive, in my opinion, based upon the concerns that I've had in my neighborhood right in front of the Medford High School project they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3113.02s">a</a> lot of work out there at the beginning of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3115.322s">It</a> went relatively smooth considering the scope of the construction work that was being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3119.744s">The</a> area was maintained relatively clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3123.687s">Access</a> to the park, access to the sidewalks was still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3126.889s">Traffic</a> was able to flow as best as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3130.051s">And</a> I thought that the road construction detours that they made made it passable and livable for the period of time that they were there doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3137.455s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I do appreciate the work that Eversource has done in putting into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3142.117s">I</a> do appreciate the work that McCourt Contracting has done putting into this because they are paying close attention to some of the community needs and quality of life issues in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3151.561s">And</a> I'd hope that we can continue this dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3153.942s">One</a> of the great things I thought that we got during the Craddock Bridge project was those three week schedules with the project briefing overviews that said, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3163.906s">83%</a> done with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3165.448s">Next</a> week, we're going to be working at these locations on these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3168.15s">And</a> that's pretty much the emails that we've been getting from Sean anyway throughout the course of the sporadic construction that's been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3175.456s">So,</a> Mr. President, I want to thank our friends from Eversource. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3178.279s">I</a> think that, you know, there's going to be a lot more time to talk about some of the issues and the impacts that are going to happen along with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3185.064s">But</a> as of right now, you know, I think that it's the open dialogue, the understanding as to when the construction is going to happen and the impact that it's going to have on the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3192.477s">in</a> the neighbors, in the traffic, in the congestion in the community that really needs to get out there so that we can get ahead of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3789.991s">I</a> move to invite our friends from Eversource back next quarter for a future update. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3794.073s">I'm</a> sure if anything happens in between then and now, we all have the ability to flip this packet over that they gave us and make a phone call and get the answers that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3802.191s">There</a> is a pressing need to bring them in sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3804.051s">They've</a> been nothing more than accommodating in the past, so I don't see why we can't put this off till next quarter, have another update when the construction season starts in the spring, and go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3812.833s">Do</a> you still like the table till next quarter? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3815.234s">Yeah,</a> same thing we did with the Lawrence Memorial.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3846.678s">Thank</a> you for your patience.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3874.767s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3876.388s">Justin</a> Springer is a dear old friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3878.409s">We</a> went to kindergarten all the way through high school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3881.83s">A</a> close, close friend of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3883.471s">Came</a> to vacations with me and my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3885.312s">Grew</a> up in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3887.513s">Spent</a> a lot of great afternoons after school in his house, at his grandmother's house down on Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3893.275s">And</a> we lost touch over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3895.596s">And</a> just recently, we fell back into touch. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3897.777s">I</a> was speaking with <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3899.778s">His</a> stepfather, Mel, not too long ago when he gave me an update that Justin was doing well, and I started paying attention on social media and noticed that Justin was named this community hero by the ABCD. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3914.843s">And</a> ABCD is an anti-poverty community development and human service organization, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3921.385s">It's</a> the largest non-profit human service agency in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3924.894s">And</a> it serves over 100 low-income families in greater Boston through its programs like neighborhood service centers and something we're all familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3932.48s">I'm</a> sure we've all heard of the Head Start programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3934.401s">Head</a> Start falls under the ABCD as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3937.243s">So</a> Justin was named a community hero this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3941.387s">And</a> I'd just like to read a little bit about what they said about Justin in the brochure. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3945.149s">Justin's</a> proven to be a tremendous asset to ABCD by lending his vast branding and marketing skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3950.222s">Talents</a> and resources to help bridge gaps in how communities assess public health education and engage with various initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3956.166s">His</a> numerous accomplishments in this area include orchestrating a street outreach team every year, conducting social media platforms for many of ABCD Health Service programs, producing major fundraising events for the Take the Test Boston program, which ABCD Health Services is a founding member. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3970.935s">And</a> he did this all in his own dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3973.253s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I always think it's important that we notice and recognize the individuals that were born and raised in this community, whose families still live here, who helped make this community great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3985.557s">And</a> we should point out the good things that they're doing in other places and here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3989.959s">Justin's</a> someone that's really an inspiration. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3992.12s">He's</a> someone that's given his time, his energy, and his effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=3996.021s">I'll</a> free a charge to the city of Boston and to its surrounding communities to help make our lives a better place. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4002.725s">Helping</a> service over 100,000 families that are in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4006.108s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it was important that we point out the great work that Medford residents continue to do on a daily basis, not only here in Medford, but in Massachusetts and across the globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4016.034s">So</a> with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4435.267s">Can</a> the sponsors of the resolution please explain to me if this is a machine that would come and do this, like, infrared technology right there on the site, if this eliminates the use of manpower and it's a machine that's performing the work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4474.652s">devices,</a> Mr. President, in various shapes and forms and various places on the internet, which means they must all be awesome, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4482.337s">Because</a> they're on the internet and they almost work great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4484.639s">But</a> no, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4485.7s">I</a> mean, it's a machine that's performing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4487.301s">So</a> we're alleviating our exposure to liability for workers getting injured. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4492.304s">We're</a> also having the machine perform the work so we know we're going to get the same standard, the same quality, every single time the work gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4500.43s">This</a> is something I support wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4501.851s">It's</a> something that we've discussed in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4503.832s">with</a> street scan and other types of infrared technologies that we can use to determine what our underground infrastructure looks like, what our streets and roadways look like, what condition they're in without actually having to go and rip them apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4513.921s">So</a> I support it wholeheartedly and I thank my colleagues for raising the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4695.514s">Oh,</a> and if we buy the machine, we're going to have to save 50% of the costs, plus fuel and manpower on the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4703.158s">Maybe</a> it's worth figuring out what the machine costs and buying one, as opposed to contracting out work to an outside entity to perform work we could do in-house.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4779.05s">So,</a> Mr. President, I guess my question is that is the intention to establish a pilot program that would privatize a portion of the work that the DPW is now performing? <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4789.983s">They're</a> not doing the streets anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4791.645s">They're</a> not paving the streets right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4793.966s">It's</a> not potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4794.627s">It's</a> the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4795.567s">Because</a> that work would fall under the scope of the DPW just because historically they've contracted out doesn't mean that it's not work that would fall under their purview.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4807.936s">I</a> don't recall them having the proper equipment to be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4810.417s">But</a> it still would fall within the scope of their labor certification for work that they could perform as ME02, maintenance equipment operator.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=4824.753s">That's</a> why if we have a machine that can pave streets that does the work of four people, we might be a worthwhile investment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5111.557s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the paper to request that before any pilot program is implemented, that the city administration meet with the collective bargaining
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5555.788s">Mr.</a> President, many of us that have been involved in local government and local politics over the years have come to know and love John Byers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5563.192s">Many</a> of us who spent a lot of time in Barry Park in the South Medford area of the city would always see Johnny riding his bike down at the basketball courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5572.477s">Many</a> of us that listen to sports radio on WEI would quite often hear Johnny call in. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5577.281s">Many</a> of us that would watch cable access television back in the early and late 90s would see Johnny on his TV shows and as a special guest on a variety of other local celebrities' TV shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5589.75s">And</a> just this past week, Johnny lost his battle with cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5595.054s">Mr.</a> President, Johnny was someone that was a student of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5598.257s">He</a> loved government. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5599.377s">He</a> ran for mayor several times, school committee, I believe, as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5602.42s">I</a> don't believe he ever ran for city council, but I may be mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5605.482s">But</a> I do recall that he'd run for a number of shots at public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5610.685s">His</a> father, Phil, is a great guy, a brother of mine from the Elks Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5614.208s">And</a> his son, or his brother, Phillip, and his father are both very close friends of mine, lifelong Metro residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5621.533s">Johnny</a> was residing in Walkling Court at the time of his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5624.935s">He</a> was surrounded by friends and family when he went, and I just hope that we can all take the time to extend our deep and sincere condolences to the family on their loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5633.119s">Johnny</a> was a special person in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5635.0s">He</a> was someone that we all knew and loved, and he's going to be sadly missed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5704.238s">Someone</a> that spent so much time in the neighborhood that he grew up in, someone that spent so much time outdoors riding his bike in the parks and stuff like that, someone that was a fixture in the neighborhood is someone that probably would warrant consideration for a corner dedication, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=5717.222s">I</a> do believe that John grew up in the College Ave area, but I'll have to get the specifics to that before I bring forward a motion that would request such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6115.951s">May</a> I be so bold to suggest, Mr. President, that we ask the City Clerk to research the paper that we had forwarded previously to Mayor Burke's administration relative to South Street and forward that to the current administration so that they have it fresh and on their desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6130.136s">And</a> I would offer that in the form of a motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6159.923s">We've</a> talked about this topic ad nauseum, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6162.265s">It's</a> been going on now for probably the better part of four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6165.688s">One</a> thing I will say is that nobody knows this issue and this concern better than Councilor Lungo, who is now Mayor Lungo. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6171.833s">Her</a> parents live on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6172.953s">Her</a> parents live on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6174.735s">So</a> for us to think that we're going to talk the talk and it's going to fall on deaf ears, I don't think is the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6180.059s">She's</a> had a vested interest in performing solutions at this intersection for as long as I can remember, as soon as the issue came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6187.065s">Councilor</a> Lungo was all over it, now Mayor Lungo I'm sure will be on top of it as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6191.449s">So</a> with that being said, I don't think there's any reason for us to anticipate or expect or not to act. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6195.914s">But</a> I do think that when we're looking at the scope of projects that are going on down there, we have the police station, we have the Eversource project. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6201.72s">I</a> think one solution we may have, Mr. President, is to designate that a live construction zone, which may allow us an opportunity to meet with our friends at Area 4 for Massachusetts Highway Department and put some controls in at the bottom of the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6214.153s">Maybe</a> no left turn if you're getting off the highway, because there's no need to get onto Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6219.878s">from</a> the off-ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6221.999s">You</a> should only be able to take a left-hand turn if you're coming off the off-ramp right there at South Street, because if you just stay on the road and get off behind the DPW, you can be on Mystic Ave as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6231.043s">So</a> there are some controls that we can put in place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6233.584s">I</a> think because of the scope of construction that's going on at the police station and the scope of construction with the South Street project, we may have a little bit of leverage here to speak with some of our friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6243.189s">over</a> at Area 4 and use their engineering expertise to come up with some short-term solutions during this very dangerous construction period, which is going to take place for a couple of years now, Mr. President, to provide some short-term relief and short-term solutions until we can address it more holistically.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6402.106s">That</a> wasn't necessarily my suggestion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6404.469s">My</a> suggestion would be to, if you're coming off the ramp, to make it left turn only so you can't take a right onto Mystic Ave coming off the highway ramp because you can stay on the highway and get off at the road with no name that we were trying to take over there over by the dance studio behind the DPW yard to still put you back out on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6421.089s">But</a> to shut that exit down for people that were coming off would actually close down the only access that they had to Medford Square, which is our central business district, and I don't think that that's something that we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6430.074s">We</a> don't want to divert all the traffic off Route 16 and not let them come to our central business district if they're coming that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6435.337s">So,</a> you know, it's going to take engineers and engineering, Mr. President, but for a short-term solution in the meantime to implement public safety controls, I think that's something that we could consider because it's an active construction site with the police station and the Eversource project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6658.048s">Also,</a> while we're under suspension, Mr. President, I'd just like to take an opportunity to wish my mother a happy birthday today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6666.411s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6667.051s">I'm</a> not going to tell you how old she is. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6669.612s">And</a> also, I'd like to announce that tomorrow at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6672.393s">at</a> the Andrews School,
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qKKOF8-DbmQ&t=6676.123s">It's</a> the monthly community police meeting.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg/2024-11-19_puRJAp7j8rg.html">City Council 01-28-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=99.433s">Present.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=133.539s">Mr.</a> President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=137.261s">This</a> was a paper that was before the council previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=139.383s">We</a> sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=144.315s">The</a> council amended it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=145.075s">I'd</a> like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=180.035s">Mr.</a> President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=195.918s">Based</a> upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=204.839s">As</a> such, I'd move for approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=209.284s">On</a> the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=214.386s">It's</a> a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=266.21s">Yes,</a> we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=267.091s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1516.658s">restricted</a> available funds used to supplement the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1520.641s">By</a> definition that's what it is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1524.663s">Motion</a> to receive and place on file.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2010.135s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2011.476s">Last</a> term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2028.242s">She</a> reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2033.517s">that</a> she was still working on that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2036.1s">So</a> I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2048.192s">And</a> add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2058.48s">then</a> at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2069.164s">So</a> my motion would be to join that paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2074.086s">To</a> include it as part of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2075.386s">It</a> doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4193.481s">Mr.</a> President, I believe it was early in December that we were up here singing Rosemary praises for her recent achievement being named Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4202.814s">And</a> as such, just recently, at the end of this month, earlier this month, she celebrated a very momentous birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4209.661s">So</a> it's been quite a year for Rosemary. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4211.623s">She</a> became a citizen of the year and an octogenarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4214.487s">I'd</a> like to wish her a very happy 80th birthday and ask my council colleagues to join her.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4429.646s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4431.808s">Paper</a> 17321 was introduced in 2017 before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4436.312s">It</a> had gone through a subcommittee process and was a paper that was reported out favorably by the subcommittee on ordinances, I do believe, and then was never scheduled for a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4446.241s">And</a> that was a paper that was also designed to regulate drop boxes here in the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4451.665s">During</a> the deliberations and discussions of this issue, one thing came up that was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4457.43s">We</a> have a textile recycling fundraising program at our elementary schools and our middle schools and <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4467.352s">facilities</a> exemption was something that was very important at the time, and I'm sure that still holds true. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4472.934s">So</a> moving forward, if we're going to regulate donation drop boxes by way of ordinance, I'd just like to request that school and city facilities be excluded from the ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=4489.701s">That</a> would be an amendment to the main paper, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5380.06s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5382.502s">I</a> think it's important to point out that this council sued the Board of Appeals relative to that decision that they made. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5387.086s">We</a> took this case to court and we lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5388.608s">We</a> were found to not have standing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5409.175s">The</a> Medford City Council filed suit and was thrown out. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5412.638s">And</a> the land court judge had found the city legislative body had zero standing to appeal the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5428.791s">We</a> got thrown out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5432.153s">We</a> spent $60,000 to be told we didn't have standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5437.601s">Then</a> the question was, are we going to spend another 60 grand to be told that again? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5441.667s">But</a> I rest my case, but I just wanted to point out the factual history of the process and what went down with Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5447.449s">Thank</a> you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5448.35s">We</a> weren't sitting back on our hands saying, oh, Locust Street's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.191s">That's</a> not what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5451.891s">We</a> sued the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5452.631s">We</a> sued the zoning board.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5477.739s">I</a> believe it was 40, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5479.14s">And</a> we weren't, we weren't, we weren't, uh, you know, co-defendants or co-appellants. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5483.962s">We</a> were an individual entity that moved forward as a, in a silo, not with the neighborhood, not with anybody else, but we're in the best interest of the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5828.88s">Mr.</a> President, I support the resolution wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5830.921s">I</a> do think it's important to point out that if the council does have in fact legal counsel to provide it with legal opinions, the legal opinions relative to ethics and the like would have to come from <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5842.648s">Statutorily,</a> the city solicitor's office, we can't have our own council giving us opinions related to that, but we can use this person for the very important job of drafting framework ordinances, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5852.63s">That's</a> something we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5853.971s">It's</a> something, you know, just in the very short time that we've been meeting as a council, we've taken, you know, several resolutions that have been filed that we've been asking for draft ordinances to be put together on that have been two and three and four years in the making, not because the city solicitor wasn't able to do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5872.152s">Capability-wise,</a> it was because he has to run the everyday operations of an entire city, as well as, you know, that he had the requests that this body makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5881.957s">So</a> with that being said, I think that this is a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5884.458s">It</a> was my number two priority, Mr. President, when we talked about council priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5888.219s">Number</a> one, improving the way we deliver services here in this community, making sure that when you pick up the phone and call because your trash barrel wasn't picked up, that someone comes and picks it up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5896.023s">When</a> you say there's a pothole in front of your house, it gets fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5898.344s">When</a> your sidewalk needs to be repaired, it gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5900.445s">Number</a> one priority, service delivery and improving the way we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5902.927s">Number</a> two priority, getting counsel for the Medford City Council so that we can put out a better work product at a faster pace, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5930.94s">Do</a> need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5932.32s">We</a> do really need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5933.761s">It's</a> not something that we don't really need, Mr. Strehler, it's something that we do really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5937.523s">You</a> know, when you're looking at the number of draft ordinances that we've requested just since this body's met this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5942.793s">We're</a> looking at nine, nine draft ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5944.895s">That's</a> more, nine ordinances is more of a work product than we put out in a term, and I can't tell you in how long. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5950.78s">If</a> we get those draft ordinances produced to us, I guarantee you we're gonna put out a stronger work product than we have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5955.284s">If</a> we have some council that's working for us, dedicated X amount of hours a week, putting those work products out, I guarantee you we're gonna do more work than we've done in the past.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=5999.715s">I</a> think if you look at the ordinances before you, it says that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire an additional legal services line item be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6007.379s">Now,</a> I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that Mayor Burke <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6010.407s">during</a> this fiscal year has already committed to us $40,000 for professional and legal services in the form of a zoning consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6016.63s">That</a> money's never actually been transferred into our line item for professional legal services in the city council's budget and the budget of the legislative. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6024.133s">It</a> sits in a revolving fund for special services that lays in the auditor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6029.654s">So,</a> with that being said, you know, we already have funds that are available to us that have been committed to us and have been budgeted to us for the purposes of legal or professional technical services, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6037.702s">I</a> think what we're looking at doing is figuring out a way that we can best capture these funds and start utilizing them so that we can put out a stronger work product.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6109.758s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6111.683s">Everybody</a> that knows me knows I love my amichis. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6114.812s">Probably</a> once a week at least, I go down to amichis and get. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6118.496s">couple</a> slices of pizza before I make my way up here to the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6121.937s">I'll</a> get two slices of cheese with that great, you know, sauce-cheese ratio and the great flop that they have down there at Amici's, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6129.039s">But</a> a couple weeks ago when I was getting out of my car to pick up my dinner before I came to the council meeting, I noticed that the drainage issue right in front of Amici's, recently they had a complete streets program down there and they did a bump out in the curb right where Amici's and Paul Revere's is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6144.924s">And</a> that bumped out, but the gradient isn't conducive to proper drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6149.573s">So</a> what's going on, Mr. President, is the water's pooling and it's becoming at least five, six, seven inches deep at some point, which renders that parking spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6159.451s">And</a> that's the parking spot that sits right out in front of, you know, four businesses that specialize in takeout food, Hong Kong Village, CB Scoops, Amici's, and Paul Revere's. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6170.278s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, it's having a negative impact on the businesses that worked on, that are operating down in West Bedford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6176.602s">Also,</a> when they did this complete streets project and they did put the bump out in, they took away a parking spot and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6181.866s">So</a> to add, you know, insult to injury, on top of losing a parking spot, now there's another parking spot there that is <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6188.73s">virtually</a> useless to the business district in times of inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=6192.391s">So</a> I'm asking that the engineering department take the appropriate steps to hold the contractor accountable that did the work and get them back out there to fix it so that the fine people that are trying to get a nice slice of pizza down there in West Medford Square are able to do so, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM/2024-11-19_7sfoGg_NhzM.html">City Council 01-21-20</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5617.949s">And</a> a public hearing would be something that is a creature of statute that is required by law versus a public meeting, which is something that we can call. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5624.113s">So</a> I would just like clarification from the council as to whether or not we're looking for a public hearing or a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5628.295s">I</a> would assume it's a public meeting because the council doesn't really have a vote over whether or not these things can go into play.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5984.538s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's also very important to point out that this is the year 10 of the census. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=5991.043s">This</a> is also the census that will have an impact on the redistricting of our state house and congressional seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6000.23s">So</a> it's very important that we do complete the census and fill it out so that we give an accurate count to the people that are making up the districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6007.696s">Because</a> maybe then we can get a rep that represents all of Medford and not just a portion of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6015.113s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6161.351s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6162.031s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6163.031s">Being</a> someone who's 40 years of age and thinking back and saying that my whole entire life, since I've been on this earth, Carol was working in one way or another for the city of Medford is amazing when I think about that, because I feel old. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6177.297s">I</a> can just imagine how she feels after putting four decades in to the City of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6181.9s">She</a> was a great worker. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6182.7s">She</a> was someone who was pleasant to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6184.642s">Like</a> Rick said, small in stature, but really someone that you knew had a presence in the office and had a presence in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6190.926s">Did</a> a great job down in the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6192.527s">That</a> was the relationship that I was able to develop with her over the short period of time that I've been working here in City of Medford's government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6198.383s">but</a> she will sadly be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6200.224s">You</a> have a great team down there, Clerk Hurtubiseest, and she was a key player. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6205.185s">As</a> we see time pass and we see Dottie leave, now we see Carol leave, and we see the changing face of the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6212.607s">Ed</a> Finn leave and you come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6214.428s">It's</a> a very interesting time right now, and I just want to have the opportunity to thank Carol for all the work that she did down there and how she helped transform the office into what it is today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6351.616s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6353.397s">This</a> is an item that came up during the last legislative session in the State House and it was defeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6359.36s">And</a> then this council, if you recall last term, asked the licensing commission to examine a feasibility as to whether or not it would make sense to implement the NIP ban with the issuance of new licenses or the transfer of licenses among our package stores here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6377.793s">That</a> resolve was filed in direct response to the state legislature not being able to pass the expansion of the bottle bill to NIPS. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6384.036s">This</a> piece of legislation was refiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6385.756s">It's</a> coming up for a hearing right now in the Department of Telecommunications and Energy subcommittee, I do believe, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6391.479s">But</a> the intent of this resolution is to have this council go in support in extending the bottle bill to NIP bottles with the hope that that will result in proper disposal and recycling of these plastic bottles that we can find just about anywhere in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6404.784s">River</a> Cleanup Day, if we go down there, you'll see thousands of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6407.706s">You</a> walk through the parking lot down at Anthony's Liquor Store, you see them all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6411.869s">They're</a> everywhere, Mr. President, and it's become an epidemic in our community, so much so that the council thought about taking action on it, and the state delegations thought about taking action on it, and the state legislatures thought about taking action on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6422.157s">Well,</a> it's time to take action, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6423.859s">So</a> I'm asking that this council request that the city clerk be authorized with the power to draft a letter supporting House Bill 2881 and send that to our state delegation and request that they vote in favor of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6434.4s">and</a> take whatever appropriate steps they can to get favorable recommendations out of subcommittee and make this come to a reality.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6719.648s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6721.269s">Today,</a> Mrs. Roberti was laid to rest, a longtime resident of Leiden Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6726.032s">Her</a> husband, Nick, is a very close friend of mine, and it's very sad to see her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6730.174s">I</a> first met her maybe nine or ten years ago at a community event, and her daughter, and she was just a very wonderful person, very nice lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6737.659s">Her</a> husband, Nicky, is a great guy as well, and we're really sad to see her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6741.761s">She</a> was a stalwart in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6743.702s">a</a> friendly face that everybody could come up and say hello to and talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6746.344s">She</a> was always willing to open her door and her home to any individual in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6750.025s">So</a> with that being said, she will be sadly missed in the South Medford neighborhood of Lydon Avenue, Mr. President, as we all know, especially up that fire in South Medford and that stretch of South Medford that's a very close-knit community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6760.291s">And</a> everybody down there knows each other, walks into each other's house without knocking the door, and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6766.394s">And</a> this was no different for Mrs. Roberti. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6768.155s">So</a> she's certainly someone that will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6770.316s">She</a> was an asset to this community and we're sad to see her go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6772.877s">I'd</a> like to have my council colleagues join me in offering the deepest condolences to her family on her recent passing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6900.102s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6901.903s">This</a> is an issue that we've discussed as a council and a body for a number of years, and we were moving in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6907.487s">A</a> lot of our meetings were being scheduled after 6 PM in the night for our boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6912.011s">And</a> we've been running into some circumstances with certain boards and commissions, a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6916.775s">At</a> a time of the day that's not conducive to doing business with residents of the general public, people that work for a living and have a concern in the neighborhood can't attend a meeting because they have other obligations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6926.626s">So</a> back several years ago, we requested that Mayor Burke make changes to the meeting structure and the boards and commissions were all meeting after 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6933.814s">at</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6934.495s">And</a> that was all well and good for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6936.658s">And</a> then as time passed, so did the stringency of those requirements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6942.024s">And</a> certain boards and commissions are now meeting at a time that's not really conducive to conducting business in the government sphere for quality of life issues in the neighborhood, such as the traffic commission, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6953.117s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, we had some discussions in our priority meeting about what direction the council should be going in over this next term. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6960.943s">And</a> one of the things that came up was the meeting times of boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6964.366s">And</a> while the boards and commissions don't fall under council purview and do have some autonomy, they also do fall under the branch of the executive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6973.232s">And</a> the mayor does have the power and authority to issue an executive directive or an executive order that would say that they're not allowed to meet before 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6981.298s">Monday</a> through Friday so that people that live in this community, but also work for a living, will have the ability to come to these meetings and participate in their government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6988.442s">So</a> that's the intent behind this proposal, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6991.784s">It's</a> something that Councilor Falco and I spoke about before the meeting this evening, and it's something that I hope my council colleagues will join me in supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6998.587s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sfoGg_NhzM&t=6999.208s">President</a> Falco.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE/2024-11-19_eQfu2R5n4yE.html">City Council 01-14-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=76.914s">I'm</a> just getting ready for the next one, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=93.873s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=95.395s">Last</a> term, this council put forward a resolution that ultimately turned into an ordinance relative to reporting of gas leaks in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=103.526s">Through</a> that discussion and debate, it was brought to this council's attention that we have an inordinate number of level 2 and level 3 gas leaks here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=111.655s">The</a> national grid or the public utility in the city have been working on a case-by-case basis to address these, but there's really no five-year plan that's going to say, over this amount of period of time, we're going to tackle X amount of gas leaks that are in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=126.617s">Pursuant</a> to state law, level two gas leaks have to be repaired in a certain amount of time after being reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=132.519s">And</a> level three gas leaks also have to be repaired in a certain amount of time after being reported, which is a little bit more expedient. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=139.202s">But</a> right now, we're seeing that these time frames aren't being hit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=142.984s">We've</a> had a number of issues on Boston Avenue, for example, with a gas leak that's going on there in front of number 81 Boston Ave, resulting in the gentleman's pre-dying, his lawn dying, the bushes in front of his house dying because the natural gas is being leaked into the air and <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=155.929s">It's</a> really a quality of life issue, but it's also a safety issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=160.15s">If</a> we're really going to be serious about climate change and moving away from our reliance on fossil fuels, one of the things we can do, I think, is repair the infrastructure that we have in place so that we're not wasting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=170.417s">So</a> I bring this resolution forward asking the administration to begin discussions, talking with National Grid to develop a five-year plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=176.601s">I</a> know sitting next to Councilor Lungo for the past six years, this was something that she was very passionate about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=181.104s">So</a> as mayor, I'm certain to see some action there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=183.746s">But</a> I just wanted to let the mayor know that we support this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=186.888s">and</a> I hope that we can get behind her and get a five-year plan in place so that we can improve our gas infrastructure here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=213.548s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, this was an item that was brought up in the 2017 term, then again in the 2019 term. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=219.254s">Here</a> we are in 2020, so I'm hoping that this is an item that we can act on. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=223.459s">I</a> think that Medford is a little bit <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=225.902s">behind</a> the times, prehistoric, if you may, when it comes to food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=229.885s">This</a> case-by-case basis that we approve one-day food truck licenses I don't think is in the best interest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=235.369s">And</a> I think by adopting the ordinance that we've been discussing, we'll be in better positions to be a little bit more reflective of the times that are before us and the wants and desires of the community relative to food truck needs.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=707.229s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=708.549s">I</a> commend my colleagues for bringing this paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=711.011s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper to add paper 15307 and paper 16705, which are two papers that this council and previous councils had discussed relative to regulating short-term rentals in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=723.899s">This</a> is a discussion that we've been having for a number of years and with the acts and resolves, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=730.019s">of</a> chapter 337 of 2018, the state legislature had addressed a number of concerns the communities were raising. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=738.145s">They</a> addressed the big picture concerns, but left local options available. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=742.649s">I</a> think this is the right approach, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=744.49s">If</a> we're going to have short-term rentals in our community, and we know that they have an impact on quality of life in neighborhoods, and also an impact on affordable housing stock in our community, I think it makes sense that we regulate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=755.679s">As</a> Councilor Behr said, we had adopted the local option at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=759.482s">of</a> the previous session, which would allow us to capture the revenues that are generated through Airbnbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=764.906s">And</a> this is just the next logical step in further regulation of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=768.348s">So</a> I commend my colleagues for bringing the issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=770.53s">I</a> ask that the paper be amended to include those other items that have been previously discussed by this body, so that we can wrap them all up in one nice pretty package and put a bow on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=783.959s">16-705.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=783.999s">16-705.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=784.059s">And</a> 15-307.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=906.785s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=908.245s">This</a> is something that the Council has talked about in the past as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=911.146s">I</a> do believe, if it wasn't three short months ago, the same resolution was brought up relative to the same collection boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=917.888s">In</a> the past, we've talked about the collection boxes at the former site of Meadow Glen Mall, which is now Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=922.989s">I</a> think it's time, Mr. President, that we take a long, hard look at whether or not we want to regulate these type of donation drop boxes in the community through a permitting process, just so that we can protect the interest in neighborhoods and the quality of life in neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=936.472s">I</a> know Councilor Marks, I don't want to steal his thunder, but he's going to talk about certain communities that have ordinances and regulations that require these drop boxes be manned and staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=945.637s">And</a> he's said this a number of occasions in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=948.038s">And</a> I think it's a good idea that we take a look at this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=951.66s">So</a> I would also suggest that as we move forward and have our health department and our code enforcement officer go and take a look at the site, that we also take a look at developing some controls by way of regulation to <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=963.866s">better</a> manage these type of entities in our community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=973.971s">We</a> already have a paper in committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1244.245s">The</a> draft ordinance regulating drop boxes I think was introduced quite a bit of time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1252.557s">Yeah,</a> I mean this was probably the 2018 was when that was introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1259.347s">He's</a> met with some opposition and is going through the subcommittee process and just failed to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1264.33s">A</a> lot of it had to do with the donation drop boxes that we have at our public schools for the clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1270.333s">Created</a> some opposition to regulating the drop boxes and then the idea didn't make its way back into the final product of ordinance stages, I guess would be the best way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1280.679s">It</a> died on the vine. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=1282.22s">But</a> there is language that is out there that is available and in committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2324.597s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2326.638s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2327.718s">Barber,</a> thank you for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2328.939s">We</a> appreciate you coming up here this evening, taking time out of your busy schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2332.873s">Mr.</a> President, all signage on any roadway needs to be in compliance with the federal standard that's established through the manual and uniform traffic control devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2343.166s">So</a> I think, first and foremost, what we should do is take a look and make sure that these rapid flashing beacon lights that we have here in the community comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2350.234s">with</a> the manual. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2352.156s">So</a> I'd ask that the paper be referred to the city engineer for a report back as to whether or not these rapid flashing beacons are in compliance with the manual and uniform traffic control devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2360.825s">If</a> they're not, then we have an answer right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2362.566s">They're</a> not in compliance, they have to come down.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2744.828s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2746.669s">The</a> patching <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2748.137s">Along</a> Golden Ave is no longer effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2750.479s">This</a> roadway is probably one of the busier thoroughfares in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2755.503s">It's</a> a very well known cut through street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2758.746s">If</a> we had a traffic study up on Murray Hill Road that said 28,000 cars a week travel up that street, then I'm going to say that 90,000 travel up Golden Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2767.093s">It's</a> a notorious cut through for Mystic Avenue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2769.536s">We</a> all know everybody goes up Golden Avenue to avoid the lights at Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2773.582s">But</a> what's happened is due to the high volume of traffic on the roadway and years and years of neglected mismaintenance on the road, we're now at a spot where any time a snowplow goes up and down the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2783.855s">the</a> street gets torn to shreds. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2785.877s">Then</a> the crew will come in, and the crew will come in and patch it, and the patch will last for a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2790.52s">Next</a> snowstorm comes, street gets torn to shreds again. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2793.602s">It's</a> very similar to the situation that we saw down on Paris Street a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2797.404s">The</a> rip rock is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2799.205s">When</a> cars drive up the street and this rip rock is exposed, it shoots all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2802.868s">It</a> damages vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2804.469s">It's</a> just time that the roadway be resurfaced, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2832.464s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2834.105s">The</a> Zamboni at La Conte Rink has been named in memory of my dear friend, I dear friend, the late John Welch. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2841.367s">And</a> the Zamboni has seen better days, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2845.108s">I</a> might have to put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2847.449s">I</a> might be the only councilor who knows how to drive a Zamboni. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2850.03s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2852.371s">We'll</a> have to have a contest. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2856.873s">But</a> having worked out at the hockey rink, having driven that Zamboni that's down there now, having worked alongside John Welch, it's safe to say that this Zamboni has seen better days. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2865.596s">In</a> certain instances, it is inoperational. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2867.817s">And</a> when the Zamboni is inoperational, then what the city does is we call the DCR and we beg, can you please send us a Zamboni? <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2873.758s">The</a> one that we have doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2875.139s">And</a> if that doesn't work, then we go to neighboring communities and we ask to borrow theirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2878.981s">I</a> think I saw Councilor Scarpelli driving down Mystic Ave and Somerville Zamboni actually two years ago to drop it off when ours was inoperational. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2888.029s">So</a> what I'm thinking, Mr. President, is we make the investment now in a new Zamboni. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2892.013s">We</a> keep the old Zamboni and we use that as a spare. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2895.036s">And</a> when we come into a circumstance where the current one we're using doesn't work, we have a spare. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2899.561s">And</a> if other communities need help, we have one to loan out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=2902.663s">I</a> think it's a very minor investment to make but the impact when the Zamboni goes down is devastating you know, everyone knows what hockey is like in the city of Medford and if there's a Cancellation of ice time because the Zamboni is not working I think that that's a problem with us and that's something that we can avoid by making the small investment So I'd ask my council colleagues to support it
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3231.141s">Point</a> of information, it's based on hours too, how many hours the machine works.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3260.561s">I</a> think it's also important to point out that these cell batteries that we use in the Zamboni, when they've reached the end of their shelf life, they need to be disposed of properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3269.846s">They</a> are hazardous material. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3271.486s">And</a> as we see the Zamboni age, we are seeing the shelf life of the batteries become shorter and the exposure of these hazardous materials in the ring become a greater increase.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3819.047s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3820.249s">I'd</a> like to further amend the paper to request that we have random rush hour directed patrols by the traffic division. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3827.036s">I</a> think that Chief Buckley has <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3829.765s">been</a> a vocal proponent for addressing concerns down in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3834.487s">And</a> I think that this is something that his administration over at the police department will support to address some of the speeding vehicles, some of the, what do they call it, skipping or lane skipping across from South Street to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3850.755s">and</a> the like, some of the traffic control devices that are in place right now that aren't being enforced, I think with enforcement will certainly provide a benefit to the quality of life of the residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3862.008s">I</a> also would be remiss if I didn't point out that life on South Street will change. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3867.217s">very</a> soon when the Eversource Pipeline project begins. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3872.28s">And</a> I'm hoping, Mr. President, that we can coordinate our efforts so that when the construction of the Eversource Pipeline is complete, that our concerns are addressed with the intersection of South and Main as well, so that when the intersection or the roadway opens, <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3888.03s">It</a> opens up with a nice new road for the residents in the neighborhood and some nice new traffic control devices for the residents in the neighborhood as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3894.373s">And</a> I think that one of the things that we can use to leverage our ability to get these lights would be the fact that we do have a mitigation agreement in place for the Eversource Pipeline Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=3904.697s">And</a> we may be able to go back in and open that back up and talk about some other items that need to be addressed and put on the table as we move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=4230.898s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to authorize the clerk to write the letter to the chief of police making inquiry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5154.655s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5155.515s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I thank Councilor Falco for bringing this resolution forward, or this draft ordinance forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5161.838s">One</a> thing that did stand out in his speech was using inclusionary zoning payments to fund an affordable housing trust, and this is something I cannot support. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5173.723s">I</a> know that it's just a basic launch pad right now for the start of a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5178.285s">However,</a> I don't feel as though allowing developers to buy their way out of the inclusionary zoning ordinance that we have in place is the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5185.039s">Ultimately,</a> the way that this would work, Mr. President, if we're allowing inclusionary zoning payments to fund our affordable housing trust fund would be that instead of developing <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5193.245s">the</a> affordable housing on site, they would be making a payment to the affordable housing trust and not creating affordable housing on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5201.45s">I</a> think that all that does is promote gentrification in these type of developments and I think it really takes the developers off the hook. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5208.014s">If</a> we're really serious about creating affordable housing in the community, we can't let the developers buy their way out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5215.218s">I</a> thank Councilor Falco for bringing it up, but that's something that I'm very passionate about. <a href="https://youtu.be/eQfu2R5n4yE&t=5218.541s">I</a> don't feel as though we should allow these developers the opportunity to just pay their way out of their obligation to help us meet our obligations for affordable housing in this community so that the people that made this community a great community can continue to live here.<h2><a href="../2024-11-19_SkrUmad63nQ/2024-11-19_SkrUmad63nQ.html">City Council 01-07-20</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=724.603s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=726.165s">This</a> is a measure that I've been thinking about for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=729.789s">Just</a> recently, we saw the change of the name of Dudley Square in Boston, and that was something that was kicked off by the City's Improvement Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=738.94s">And</a> after looking into the City's Improvement Committee and the duties and functions that they have, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=743.485s">and</a> looking at the City of Medford and the roles and responsibilities that our various departments have, I thought that it might be a good idea for us to start a discussion about creating a City Beautification and Improvement Advisory Commission that can provide us with ideas and revenue requests to figure out ways that we can better our curb appeal for those that are coming to the community and better deliver city services here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=764.812s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the measure to send this to the city solicitor for a draft framework for future debate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=837.182s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=838.523s">This</a> is something that's rather self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=840.465s">Councilor</a> Marksley should actually be included as a co-sponsor on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=843.146s">This</a> is a measure that we discussed in previous session. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=845.825s">It's</a> something that's very important to this community, and it's something that I think we should keep on the forefront going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=850.447s">We</a> have about a 3.5-mile-long gas pipeline that's going to be stretching down Mystic Gap, down South Street, underneath the Mystic River, through our community garden, up Winthrop Street, down past Medford High School, all the way to the Winchester border, and then continue on into Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=863.352s">It's</a> going to be a very large construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=865.173s">It's</a> going to cause a number of disruptions to traffic, to traffic flow, to quality of life for residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=870.295s">And</a> I think it's very important, Mr. President, that we keep people informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=873.856s">We</a> did something very similar with the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=877.118s">There</a> was a lot of concern about the future of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, and through the good work of friends from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital that are here this evening, actually, to witness our first meeting with our two new Councilors, we were able to garner some community support for the project, address the number of concerns that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=891.908s">and</a> come up with a project that actually worked for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=894.41s">So</a> with that being said, I'm hoping that we can do the same for this Eversource Pipeline project and create an open and transparent line of communication between us and the project managers and project development teams so that we can address some of these quality of life issues that are gonna be inevitable with a project of this size.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=973.027s">A</a> little before August, at the end of Harvard Street at Mystic Avenue, the left-hand lane was turned into a left-turn only lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=982.383s">And</a> since that time, there's been some changes to the signalization of the lights further down Route 16, but those changes haven't made their way all the way up Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=991.226s">So</a> what happens, Mr. President, is if you were coming from, oh, say, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=994.988s">Clemens</a> Church after your kids' basketball game last Saturday morning at 10 o'clock, and you drove down Harvard Street, and you passed the intersection of Main Street, and then you'd get right past Main Street and be stuck in traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1008.552s">And</a> then the light on, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1011.278s">Me</a> and Harvard and Willis would change green, but the light on Mystic Ave wouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1015.763s">So</a> the traffic wouldn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1017.705s">The</a> light would turn red, then the light would turn green between Willis and Harvard, I mean Willis and Mystic, and the cars would proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1025.012s">So</a> I think it's really just an engineering issue, a signal timing issue that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1029.216s">Ultimately,</a> I'd like to see that left-hand lane go back to the way that it was originally, where it was a straight or left. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1035.323s">But</a> it's my understanding that the state DOT put those restrictions in as a result of some of the construction traffic mitigation that was surrounding the casino project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1043.99s">But</a> based upon the numbers that we've seen at the casino and the underperformance that we've seen at these casinos based upon their estimates versus their actual returns, I think that it might be something that we can look at in changing that back, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1054.979s">I</a> don't think any of us have really felt the big impact of traffic since the casinos opened here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1060.083s">And</a> I think that some of these issues that are, you know, affecting our neighborhood's traffic flow and congestion can really be addressed through an engineering study in the timing of lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1068.631s">I</a> know we spoke about South Street and Main Street and the smart lights that we might be able to put there and the large cost that comes along with those to create a situation where we have smart lights that go through our squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1081.003s">I</a> think the price tag was somewhere around $5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=1084.105s">But</a> I think that engineering study or at least the very least the city engineer taking a look at this doing a traffic count and coming up with a Long-term solution for the residents in the neighborhood would be beneficial.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2002.728s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2003.588s">Mr.</a> Pitt, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2004.608s">So</a> with the adoption of this homework petition, what we're saying is that <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2010.261s">This</a> agreement that we've negotiated on April 11, 2014, the funds would not have to come before the council for appropriation when they're being spent?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2019.986s">And</a> it also says that any other successor agreement after this April 2014 agreement that negotiated between Wynne and the administration?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2033.773s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2036.104s">Well,</a> actually, one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2037.084s">Is</a> there a reason why we want to do it that way as opposed to the agreement at a time, why we want to give up blanket authority from now until the end of time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2071.007s">Or</a> if a second successor agreement is entered into in the future to address community mitigation impacts, the benefits that are negotiated in that agreement would not be subject to appropriation by the council?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2085.861s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2086.161s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2523.701s">And</a> they're in support, thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2527.342s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2529.063s">Councilor</a> Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2530.959s">spoke</a> to something that was a concern of mine, which was the term of the agreement and the total dollar figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2536.58s">At</a> the conclusion of this agreement, it looks like it's going to be somewhere around 40 or 50 million bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2544.182s">Ultimately,</a> if we have a community fund payment of $125,000, all it is is a direct cash payment of $125 to a thing called the community fund, which outlines what certain areas you can spend it on?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2566.45s">I</a> mean, my concern is this, is to give blanket authority to the administration for the spending of the upwards of $50 million without council appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2579.06s">And</a> to grant this authority for a period of time that exceeds three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2582.802s">That's</a> concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2586.302s">If</a> we could keep it to the one agreement that we're currently in, I'd feel much more comfortable about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2591.904s">And</a> the successor agreements would be something that we'd have to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2596.346s">But</a> I just think that to give blanket authority to spend $50 million without any council appropriation, as long as it falls within the <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2607.205s">the</a> bucket, if I'm understanding this correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2608.947s">Transportation</a> hub payment means that, you know, we got $425,000 for transportation related issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2615.333s">It</a> can be anything that we want to spend it on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2619.938s">Anything</a> transportation related or is it outlined and specified in an agreement or subject to a plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2625.123s">I</a> mean, I look at these funds and I say these funds are good funds to use for planning purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2629.581s">The</a> money that we wouldn't have had otherwise without this agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2633.583s">So</a> this is monies that we should be using for planning purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2635.904s">If</a> we're looking about transportation, let's figure out transportation planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2639.126s">Let's</a> use that money to plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2641.907s">But</a> to have a blanket authority for a period of time of three decades and the ability to spend $50 million without a check and balance from the council is something that does raise a red flag in my opinion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2671.954s">Well,</a> I mean, I just don't think it's fair to saddle future councilors with this decision that we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2678.519s">I</a> have no problem doing it with the body that's here right now, but 10 years or 15 years down the line, this decision's going to have already been made for somebody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2686.125s">And</a> that's something that I think we might also want to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2689.908s">But</a> I rest my case. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2691.63s">I</a> appreciate you for filling me in and raising my concerns.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2743.966s">ride</a> share fees are subject to appropriation, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=2753.712s">So</a> we could actually designate the fund, but still keep everything subject to appropriation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3012.673s">Thank</a> you council appears Council night mr. President I'd like to make a motion to strike the words without further appropriation from section one of the homework petition that's been proposed and replace it with subject to appropriation I <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3029.181s">This</a> would allow the flexibility to create the special revenue fund, to let it exist, to allow the monies to be put into the appropriate buckets of the special revenue fund, but when that money gets spent, it comes before the Council for Appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3046.705s">I</a> wouldn't tie the hands of future councilors because any money that's being spent has to come before the Council for Appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3051.886s">It</a> allows the administration to comply with the DOI directives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3054.487s">I</a> think it's a great compromise.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3165.371s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3168.531s">It</a> was to strike the word in section one that would say without further appropriation and replace that with subject to appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3187.728s">Notwithstanding</a> any provisions of Massachusetts general laws or the provisions of any general law special or regulation to the contrary, the city of Medford through the mayor of the city of Medford may strike without further appropriation, replace with subject to appropriation, utilize and expend all funds received by way of the surrounding community agreement et al.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3263.976s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3265.237s">Again,</a> as we shift gears into a new legislative session, I want to make sure that we keep on the forefront of our minds the brewery ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3273.08s">This</a> was something that we were almost crossing the finish line at at one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3277.261s">We</a> got some <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3278.842s">Recommendations</a> or requests, I guess, from a local business group in the community that was supposed to report back to us sometime in November about what they felt about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3286.669s">I</a> don't believe that we've received anything at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3292.114s">It's</a> been about 60 days since they said that they were going to report back to us on 11-7, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3296.839s">So</a> I'm hoping that we can set this up for a further committee of the whole meeting and move forward on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3476.7s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3479.146s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3483.388s">Michael</a> Callahan was a lifelong Medford resident, famous across the Fulton Heights area of the city particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3491.71s">Grew</a> up on Saunders Street, was a paper boy in the area for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3496.952s">Moved</a> on to Salem Street and took care of his elderly mother who was suffering from dementia for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3502.158s">He</a> was a Vietnam veteran, an aide to Senators Bullock and McKenner, both who represented Medford at one portion of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3508.185s">Assistant</a> Commissioner of Racing, Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3511.489s">The</a> founder and chairman of the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3514.893s">He</a> was elected to the Governor's Council in 1998 and presided over the appointment of over 500 judges and clerks across the Commonwealth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3525.016s">He</a> had 50 years of public service under his belt upon his passing, all during the which time he resided in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3533.799s">If</a> you go up to Wright's Pond, Mr. President, you'll see a monument. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3537.06s">dedicated</a> to Councilor Callaghan, or Mikey C as we called him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3541.806s">And</a> legend has it that back in the early 80s when development was booming in the city of Medford and condos were going up all across the city, there were plans to take Wrights Pond and develop Wrights Pond into a condominium complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3554.5s">And</a> Mike Callaghan led the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3556.292s">to</a> save Rights Pond, and back in 2014, fittingly, Mayor McGlynn dedicated a portion of Rights Pond in Michael Callahan's memory for the work that he did in saving Rights Pond and preserving it from overdevelopment. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3570.44s">Michael,</a> like I said, was a mentor to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3572.001s">I</a> learned a lot about government and the way government works from Michael Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3575.223s">He</a> was someone that I spent a great deal of time with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3577.444s">and</a> someone that I was very glad to call a friend, very lucky to have as a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3581.989s">And</a> every year since I've been elected to the council, I've brought this up right around the time of his passing to commemorate the service that he's provided to the people of Medford and to be sure that these are remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3591.299s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues to support this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3811.353s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3812.794s">Ultimately,</a> what this proposal is, is it's a request to move a meeting night from Tuesday to Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3817.698s">Currently,</a> pursuant to the open meeting law, absent weekends and holidays, you need 48 hours prior to your meeting to post. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3824.502s">Because</a> our meetings are on Tuesday, that requires the city of Medford, city clerk, to post our council meetings on Friday before the close of business at 1230, which means that we need to, as councilors, get our resolutions to the city clerk by Friday morning at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3841.083s">Now,</a> the majority of us in this community that go out on the weekends, take your kids to basketball practice, go down to the coffee shop, take a jog, whatever it may be, run into a lot of people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3851.393s">A</a> lot of people that have requests for services, a lot of people that have questions and concerns about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3857.339s">What</a> ends up happening a lot of the time, Mr. President, is that those questions and concerns that arise over the weekend before the Tuesday meeting don't make it on the agenda because on Friday we have to get everything by 9 o'clock so that the city clerk can produce the agenda by 1230 on Friday afternoon before the close of business and before his staff leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3875.635s">That</a> coupled with the fact, it's my understanding, that because of that short time frame, on Friday morning, the staff is, it's very hectic in the clerk's office on Friday mornings to get this agenda out because of the number of items that are coming in at the 11th hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3891.521s">You</a> know, if you figure that the council meets on a Tuesday night and we have a very late meeting, it goes till 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3896.062s">We</a> all wake up the next morning, go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3898.063s">We</a> come back to the City Hall for a Committee of the Whole meeting on a Wednesday, and that goes for a couple hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3902.926s">We</a> work until 8 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3904.086s">Okay,</a> we all go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3905.347s">We</a> go to work the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3906.308s">It's</a> already Thursday, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3908.729s">So</a> it gives us very little time to place items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3912.351s">That</a> coupled with the fact that during the last term, nearly one in four resolutions that were filed by councilors were filed under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3920.656s">We're</a> here talking about transparency, the need for transparent government. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3924.641s">We're</a> putting cameras in our meeting rooms, but when one-fourth of the items that the council actually discusses aren't showing up on the agenda, are we truly being transparent? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3934.344s">And</a> it was my thinking, Mr. President, because I know it's a problem for me sometimes to get items on the agenda based upon the short time frame we have from Tuesday to Friday morning, and then I go out into the community and I participate in community events and family events and the like, and I get inundated with questions, concerns, and calls, and we try to address those things, but sometimes they need to make their way to the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3954.808s">And</a> when they make their way to the agenda, they're doing so under suspension, and they're not showing up on the council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3960.577s">So</a> I thought that this might be a way that we could stem some of the under suspension resolutions that were being filed here at the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3967.059s">Allow</a> the city clerk's office to have a little bit of breathing room. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3969.68s">Allow</a> the council to have a little bit more time to put items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3973.421s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, I have always said that I can do my homework a lot better if I know what I'm going to be studying. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3980.682s">If</a> there's an issue that's on the agenda and I know about it, I can study it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3984.243s">If</a> there's an issue that's not on the agenda that's coming up at the meeting, we're all walking in blind. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=3988.564s">So</a> I'm hoping that you know with the move of the meetings from Tuesday nights to Wednesday nights It will allow us the opportunity to number one have the building have City Council meetings on nights that City Hall is already open late City Hall is open for business on Wednesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4000.635s">So</a> from a facilities standpoint from a you know environmental standpoint I open in the building up every Tuesday night to turn the heat on for the council meetings where it's already going to be on on a Wednesday night anyway and <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4010.443s">And</a> the fact that department heads are in the building on Wednesday nights already and will allow us an ease of scheduling if we have committees of the whole or we have matters that are before us here, we can get them here by request on Wednesday nights where they're already here late. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4022.109s">So</a> from an operational and functional standpoint of government, Mr. President, I thought it made sense from the side of things where everybody talks about what can we do to get more people involved in the city council meetings and come into the city council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4033.996s">City</a> Hall is open on Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4035.137s">People</a> are here paying their tax bill, attending other meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4038.038s">Now</a> the council meeting is open too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4039.279s">They're</a> just passing by. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4040.119s">They</a> might want to come in and pop in and be curious and explore a little bit more about what the city council has to say here in all the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4046.742s">So</a> it's really something that I put forward for transparency purposes, Mr. President, to ensure that we as councils have ample opportunity to place things on the agenda, that the items that are being placed on the agenda are visible and noticed to the public and to our council colleagues so that we can do our homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4064.01s">and</a> come prepared to the meeting, or better prepared to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4066.392s">I</a> know that this isn't going to stop all in the suspension resolutions, but what it is going to do, I think, is give us a little bit of extra time to put items on the agenda to be a little bit more transparent and a little bit more open. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4076.392s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from with it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4079.394s">It's</a> six of one, half a dozen of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4081.795s">I'm</a> ready to come to work any night. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4083.836s">I'm</a> just bringing this forward for the simple purpose that we file an inordinate number of resolutions under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4088.878s">And</a> I think with the move of the meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday will allow us an exceeding period of time for us to file resolutions and get them out there with the same 48 hour notice that's required under the open meeting law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4329.943s">Mr.</a> President, ultimately, the fact of the matter is that one out of four resolutions that get filed by the Council are filed under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4336.089s">And</a> if we're truly committed to being a transparent body, then it shouldn't be issue-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4339.592s">It</a> should be holistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4341.133s">We</a> should be transparent or we shouldn't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4342.714s">It</a> doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4343.335s">Well,</a> that's only a happy birthday, so we're not going to be transparent about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4346.318s">But</a> this is a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4347.298s">This</a> is something I care about, so we're going to be transparent about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4349.701s">I</a> think if we're going to adopt the mantra of being transparent, let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4353.036s">And,</a> you know, ultimately, if we have a Friday agenda and a Saturday and a Sunday and a Monday and a Tuesday morning to review it, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4361.302s">I'll</a> review everything that's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4362.923s">But,</a> again, the fact of the matter is 25% of the items that come up aren't on the agenda and you can't review something that's not on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4369.227s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4370.368s">But,</a> again, you know, Mr. President, like I said, six of one, half a dozen of the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=4374.611s">That's</a> my position.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5029.603s">Ultimately,</a> I brought the paper forward, Mr. President, three weeks before the close of the last session to provide ample opportunity for the new members to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5039.366s">It</a> was my thinking that because we're starting a new session in a new term, that we should start it all off with the paper and the agenda and go from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5048.429s">But</a> like I said, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5050.57s">I'm</a> not going to lose sleep over it, one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5052.211s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5052.872s">We're</a> going to be coming here to meet one night or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5054.873s">It's</a> either Tuesdays or Wednesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5056.094s">It's</a> not a real big deal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5062.639s">I've</a> also reviewed the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5063.56s">I</a> didn't see anything.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5125.585s">You</a> know, so I think that, you know- The chair would welcome those recommendations, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5169.855s">It's</a> written in the standing rules, but the thing that we were looking up was whether or not it was a supermajority or a majority vote to change the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5179.604s">But</a> it's written in the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5180.625s">It's</a> in section one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5186.273s">It's</a> dictated by the rules, not the chart.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5310.407s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5312.206s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5313.606s">I</a> believe today is January 7th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5315.307s">Under</a> unfinished business, we do have paper 19483 establishing the other post-employment benefits trust fund, which is a compliance vote to establish an employee benefits trust with accord with the division of local services from the Department of Revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5330.092s">That</a> was something that we had discussed previously and <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5335.096s">I</a> thought we adopted, but it was adopted through a committee report, but not a formal vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5338.978s">So</a> as such, we had to advertise this ordinance and go through the proper channels, and it's eligible for third reading this evening and move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5610.927s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5613.528s">Working</a> in government and working in politics, I think it's safe to say that you come across a very diverse array of people, great people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5623.372s">You</a> meet a lot of people out in the street that are just wonderful people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5626.253s">You've</a> developed great, strong working relationships with certain individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5630.234s">And</a> Mark Rumley was a person, when I first got involved in government back some 20 years ago, was very generous with his time to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5638.609s">explaining</a> certain things to me, showing me some of the ropes when I was a young kid working in the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5645.354s">Upon</a> my election to the city council, that relationship grew, and I'm just very lucky to be able to call Mark Rumley a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5654.42s">You</a> know, during my term as a councilor, he's always been someone that I've relied on for advice, for wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5660.584s">I</a> always felt as though the opinion that he gave from a legal perspective was a legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5664.447s">It</a> wasn't politically driven, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5666.588s">Mark</a> Rumley really held his title as a lawyer and the oath that he's taken to the law first, and he never compromised his integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5674.974s">He's</a> truly a man of the cloth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5676.135s">He's</a> truly someone that I'm really grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with and to be around. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5681.458s">And</a> in government, you meet some of those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5685.4s">You're</a> only going to meet so many working in government and working in a public life. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5688.482s">And</a> Mark Brumley is one of those people that I know I'm very lucky to have in my corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5693.264s">And</a> I know I'm very lucky to have been able to work with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5695.625s">And</a> I wish him the best of luck in his retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5697.827s">And</a> I hope to say, as Councilor Mark said, that this isn't the last we see of him and that there is a role for him here in City Hall in the future, whether it be as a consultant or as someone that comes down and participates in government and provides us with his opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5710.723s">because</a> that's something that he's never been shy of doing and I hope that he continues to do it because when he did it, he made us all a better body. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5716.535s">So</a> with that being said, Mark, congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5718.598s">Best</a> of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=5719.16s">I</a> wish you the best in your retirement and I know you're going to enjoy it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6510.128s">for</a> bringing the books and to please extend my regards to Mr. McGonigal. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6514.19s">Let</a> him know I'll be reading the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6515.451s">I</a> appreciate him bringing them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6516.731s">But</a> then he kind of started going after me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6519.413s">He</a> gave us the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6521.934s">But</a> that's what I was going to get at. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6523.695s">Sorry</a> to ruin your mojo there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6525.016s">I</a> apologize.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6703.393s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6704.273s">Because</a> of the scope of the paper and the scope of the project, I believe it's a project that's gonna be subject to site plan review, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6711.455s">Number</a> two, I think it might fall under subdivision control. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6715.157s">So</a> those are two aspects of our zoning act that are governed by the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6720.178s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkrUmad63nQ&t=6720.398s">So</a> I'd like to ask that the director of the Office of Community Development also be involved in the future discussions.<h2><a href="../2020-04-17_MCM00000002/2020-04-17_MCM00000002.html">Medford City Council 02-26-19</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=106.723s">Mr.</a> President, the reason why I request that we suspend the rules is to take up paper 19071, a petition by Shower Rodriguez relative to the Medford Elementary School Citywide PTO announcing the Harlem Wizards game on March 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=117.891s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=144.527s">Mr.</a> President, before you turn the microphone over to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=146.608s">Rodriguez,</a> I do want to make sure that we preface this with the conversation that I had with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=151.429s">Rodriguez</a> and the agreement that we came to was that if I suspend the rules for her to go first, that she would be playing in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=156.783s">March</a> 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=158.044s">So</a> she's gonna buy a new pair of sneakers and she's gonna be down there on the 13th.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=541.593s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=543.114s">I'd</a> request that a 90-day review be placed on this paper by way of amendment, and I'd also ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=549.028s">It's</a> a convictual license, not a special permit, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=551.73s">That's</a> the 90-day review we placed on the convictual license.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=555.574s">Just</a> based upon the nature of the business, Mr. President, that we can take a 90-day review on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=884.08s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=885.34s">With</a> the petitioner is not present this evening, I don't feel as though it would be appropriate for us to take a vote with him not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=890.521s">So</a> with that being said, I'd request that this matter be moved to the 3-12 agenda for a council vote on the special permit, with notice being given to the gentleman that he's requested to appear. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=898.523s">Failure</a> to appear will result in the council voting for his permit without him present. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=903.363s">But</a> at this point in time, the gentleman's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=905.964s">So</a> I'd ask that we continue the matter for three weeks and allow the gentleman the opportunity to come here and be available to us when we take this vote.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1271.074s">Mr.</a> President, I thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1273.496s">And</a> I think that payment in lieu of tax agreements is something that are very important for us here in the community because it allows us the opportunity to capture non-tax revenue and to capture that revenue in a reoccurring fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1284.024s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and also request that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1287.951s">the</a> city administration report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1290.432s">If</a> they have identified any property owning non-profit tax exempt properties, they can also approach to discuss whether or not we can implement a payment of lieu of taxes program with them as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1562.086s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to request that the Code Enforcement Officer also visit Lawrence Memorial Hospital for compliance with the sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1568.129s">It's</a> been brought to my attention by a number of neighbors that a temporary sign has been erected that's in violation of our sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1574.631s">It's</a> causing blight and eyesore for the residents in the neighborhood, and they've requested that the Code Enforcement Officer make a visit over to Lawrence Memorial Hospital and remind them of the criteria that's included in our sign ordinance, one of them being a special permit from the City Council for a sign that is outside the scope of our ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1709.363s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1710.863s">We're</a> picking up where we left off last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1713.083s">I</a> had put forward a resolution requesting that the city solicitor draft an ordinance of similar fashion that would be considered a tree preservation protection and replacement ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1723.985s">The</a> council had expressed some concern relative to the devil being in the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1728.446s">As</a> such, it was a very long meeting as well last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1731.847s">I</a> think we didn't get out of it until about half to 12 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1734.453s">So</a> as such, I decided that it was in the best fashion for the deliberative process to withdraw the paper and to put forward some language, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1740.778s">So</a> here before us, we have this evening is going to be a launching pad to start a discussion on the regulation of private trees in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1748.498s">And</a> if we go through the ordinance briefly, we'll have section one, which would be definitions defining, you know, the parameters of applicability, certain exemptions for individuals who'd be exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1762.007s">In</a> applicability, it would be for, right now in the draft proposal, lots that are equal to or greater than 10,000 square feet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1768.391s">Those</a> would be lots that are <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1770.008s">large</a> enough to be developed for multi-family homes if three families or larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1773.71s">I've</a> also included in this some language relative to an 18-month rolling review period, which would be in line with our demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1782.575s">We</a> have a second section related to applicability and the requirements that are going to be asked of individuals that do not have an exempt property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1790.799s">Also,</a> there's certain protections in there relative to change of ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1794.361s">If</a> a lot is clear-cut but the trees are not replaced or the tree farm hasn't been contributed to, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1799.714s">There's</a> restrictions and requirements relative to change of ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1805.756s">We</a> also have the third section, which would be the process and how a permit is going to be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1816.46s">Activities</a> not requiring a permit, Mr. President, exempt activities that wouldn't require a permit like pruning and emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1822.461s">Ultimately,</a> what this ordinance does is it defines what would be a preferably protected tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1827.87s">And</a> then it establishes a criteria to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1831.031s">It's</a> a launching pad, as I said before. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1833.052s">It's</a> not the final product. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1834.613s">And</a> I'd like to ask my council colleagues to indulge me by allowing this paper to be referred to the zoning subcommittee for us to have further deliberations with Go Green Medford, the Forestry Department, and legal counsel for us to come up with a draft that we can all live with, debate, and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1851.784s">Ultimately,</a> this paper right here would not be ready to be voted on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1854.686s">I've</a> had discussions with our code enforcement officer and there are some areas that are lacking relative to safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1859.468s">For</a> example, last night we had a very windy night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1862.609s">A</a> lot of trees were damaged in private residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1865.711s">If</a> a tree is on a private residence on lot A and it's caused damage to lot B based upon the decision of our tree warden or our arborist, then appropriate steps need to be taken to protect that individual's property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1876.396s">We</a> have no control in this proposed ordinance to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1879.841s">I've</a> had discussions with Mr. Bavuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1881.542s">I've</a> had discussions with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1882.623s">Tudin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1883.263s">I've</a> had discussions with Mr. Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1884.924s">I've</a> had discussions with Mr. Campolis from the Forestry Department as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1888.366s">And</a> they think that this is a great starting point for a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1892.089s">But</a> in terms of applicability in Medford, there will need to be changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=1895.07s">That's</a> why I make the motion to have this sent to the Zoning Subcommittee and then ask my council colleagues to indulge me and such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2123.925s">Mr.</a> President, one of the key reasons why I brought this thing forward was basically just because of what Councilor Mack said, that we're having a lack of investment in the shade trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2133.088s">And</a> one of the key components of the tree replacement zone, the zoning amendment would be that we have a tree replacement fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2139.089s">So</a> if private homeowners that take down a preferably protected tree are unable <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2144.462s">to</a> replace it on property, they'll pay into a tree fund to the city and the city will have a revolving account and a funding mechanism to actually purchase shade trees to be used in public lands and as part of the back street, back of the sidewalk program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2155.689s">So</a> yeah, it's right on the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2157.39s">I</a> think these are some of the issues that we need to vet out, but I think we're really all on the same page in terms of some of the important aspects that we need to put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2163.914s">So</a> I thank Councilor Marks for his kind words. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2165.775s">And</a> it was the right course withdrawing and bringing forward language from last week's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=2169.698s">So</a> I'm glad that we had the opportunity to debate that and discuss it and bring this measure forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3443.208s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3444.809s">I'd</a> request that we amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3446.739s">I'm</a> actually amending the paper by filing an amendment right now, requesting that the Medford Public Library, or its fundraising arm, file an application for determinative eligibility for community preservation funds with the Community Preservation Commission under the funding opportunities for recreational or historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3466.128s">Ultimately,</a> we have a library there with a number of historic artifacts in it that have been locked up in an attic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3470.55s">We're</a> looking to get these artifacts out of the attic and be more visible and accessible to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3474.916s">And</a> also, I can't think of any better recreational facility in our community than a library, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3479.619s">So</a> I think that these two avenues might be available for us to pursue additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3485.584s">I</a> know Councilor Marks has expressed some concern in the past about using CPA funds to fund municipal projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3491.688s">However,</a> based upon a need for a contingency plan, I think that it only makes sense for us to see whether or not the <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3497.827s">public</a> library would be eligible for these Community Preservation Act funds by filing a determination of eligibility with the CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=3505.89s">And</a> then if, in fact, we do need to come up with a contingency plan, maybe that can be part of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4289.841s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4291.162s">I</a> think it's also important to point out that because we're diverting buses through College Avenue that are going to go past Tufts University, but we're not diverting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4298.706s">The</a> T is diverting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4299.466s">The</a> administration signed off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4301.917s">that</a> they're asking us just for the temporary bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4304.098s">But</a> ultimately, if you look at the area in front of Tufts University on College Avenue, historically, you'll see a large number of buses that are parked there, buses for whatever team Tufts University is playing at Spicer Field, for whatever team Tufts University is playing at the gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4319.506s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, moving forward, I'd like to see if we can put some contingencies upon it, where as long as this is the temporary bus route, the buses are not able to park on College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4327.371s">They'd</a> have to be required to park inside the parking lot at Spicer Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000002&t=4330.427s">in</a> the interest of public safety, in the interest of the environment, idling, so on and so forth.<h2><a href="../2024-03-13_MCM00000049/2024-03-13_MCM00000049.html">Medford City Council 02-19-19</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=111.643s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=113.584s">We've</a> received some notifications from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, the Department of Public Health at the state level relative to the proceedings at the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=121.028s">At</a> this point, I'd like to turn the floor over to representatives from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital to update us on the progress.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1427.254s">Mr.</a> President, at this point, I believe we did have a resident from the community that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=1431.944s">I</a> think maybe we should turn the floor over to her and see if there are any issues that have come up through the small meetings in the community that may be able to be addressed this evening as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5074.768s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5076.069s">I'd</a> just like to ask if Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5077.81s">O'Reilly</a> and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5078.491s">Minor</a> could provide the city messenger with a copy of those criteria that they spoke of earlier in the meeting, so we can include that in the council record for tonight's proceedings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5088.237s">And</a> I'd also ask that we reconvene in four weeks' time, Mr. President, for another monthly update.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5096.682s">And</a> if we have to check with Janet to see her schedule, that's fine with me, too.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5110.981s">If</a> we could have a copy of that included in the minutes for next council meeting, I'd appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=5220.895s">Just</a> that we can reconvene in four weeks' time, Mr. President, for a further update.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6656.321s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem with the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6659.262s">I</a> just ask that we attach a condition to the special permit that the approval would be attached to the applicant's preferred use, applied use, as opposed to the business address. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6672.048s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6851.065s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6852.386s">I</a> certainly have no problem sending this to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6856.129s">I'd</a> ask that also a 90-day review be something that the subcommittee consider with pending approval as a condition, and also that <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6864.635s">paper</a> 17606, which is the Evangelical Haitian Church on High Street, also be brought in to have a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6876.004s">We</a> had a 90-day review on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6877.966s">The</a> review never happened because they didn't illuminate the sign within the initial 90 days of permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6882.55s">So</a> I think we need to do a little follow-up on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=6885.092s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8134.585s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8136.445s">I'm</a> very pleased to see this matter reach the council floor this evening for a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8141.446s">This</a> is a product of work that the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee worked on for a period of time for about two and a half years, at which time we split the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee to a Zoning Subcommittee to an Ordinance Subcommittee, and through a team of <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8155.387s">You,</a> Councilor Longo, and myself were able to come up with the language that's included here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8159.93s">I</a> think Director DiLorenzo gave a great breakdown as to how we came to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8166.334s">This</a> ordinance establishes criteria as to when inclusionary zoning is applicable. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8171.747s">It</a> establishes a three-tiered system for when a developer comes into the community looking to build a development of ten units or more, that certain thresholds need to be met for affordability. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8184.675s">I</a> think it's really a great step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8187.356s">We</a> are formalizing a process that was done previously by negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8191.447s">And</a> the language that we used was based upon best practices that were put out through the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8198.975s">It's</a> been determined to be a best practice across a number of municipalities here in Massachusetts municipal government, so I'm very pleased about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8206.142s">The</a> paper's also going to go on legal review, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8208.344s">It's</a> been reviewed by a city solicitor previously prior to introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8212.087s">The</a> councils vote on it a number of times, probably five times, if I can remember correctly, between subcommittee, committee of the whole reports, subcommittee reports, sending it to the CD board and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8223.794s">So</a> I'm really excited about this, and I think that Councilor Scarpelli's directive was the right one, that we adopt the recommendations that have been made by the CD board to include them into this ordinance, and that we move forward for a first reading on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8237.214s">And</a> then we can take up the other issues in the committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8240.716s">Personally,</a> I feel as though a subcommittee would be more beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8243.597s">However,</a> I defer to him as the chairman as to what direction he'd like to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8247.099s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I support Councilor Scarpelli's direction that this should go in wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8254.583s">I</a> think that we should move for a first reading this evening after adopting the requirements that were made by the CD board. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8259.919s">I</a> certainly have no problem adopting the amendments that Councilor Longo has offered this evening because I feel as though the way that she's articulated and expressed it is a direct reflection of the discussions that we had in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8270.665s">We</a> were deliberating and vetting this material over that period of, you know, two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8275.868s">So</a> with that being said, I would second Councilor Scarpelli's motion and move forward with the matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8355.861s">For</a> consistency purposes, Councilor, ultimately we want our court of ordinances to read consistently from point A to point B to point C to point D. And when you look at our <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8365.433s">court</a> of ordinances, the projects that require site plan review, our projects of 10 units or higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8369.697s">So</a> we decided that it would be in the best interest for continuity purposes to keep that same criteria and same threshold as 10 units.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8600.154s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8601.295s">I</a> also think it's important to point out that the date that this paper would become effective would be the date that it's approved by the council and signed by the mayor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8609.978s">So</a> any applications that come in between then and now would not be covered under the Zoning Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8614.22s">It</a> doesn't become effective until it's signed by the mayor, which is very important because I know that we have a number of large developments that are going to be coming into the community that have not submitted applications for permitting at this point in time, but there will be very, very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8626.536s">And</a> with the introduction of this bill, I'm sure that's going to be also speeding them up a little bit to get an application into our building department prior to the approval of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8636.442s">So</a> I really do think it's important that we act on the languages before so we can get something on the books so that we can hold these developers and the community accountable to this threshold. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8645.607s">We</a> can go back to the drawing board if we need to, to modify it, twerk it and tweak it, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8649.91s">But</a> for the purposes of getting something on the books, I think it's very important that we do so because it will not take effect <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8655.532s">until</a> it's signed by the mayor and all applications thereafter will be covered by it, but not previously.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=8886.001s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move the question as amended.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9604.777s">Oh,</a> Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9606.338s">The</a> majority of the changes just result to a timeline that the projects would have to be done within five years, that segmentation couldn't occur within five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9614.48s">But</a> I think if you give your name and address to the city messenger, well, you could take that right from the city solicitor right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9620.702s">You</a> might have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9622.623s">Instant.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9860.327s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9861.968s">Recently,</a> Mr. Kreatz had passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9864.25s">We</a> all know the Kreatz family, having been involved here in Medford politics and government. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9868.693s">Sister-in-law</a> Kathy's on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9870.394s">Brother</a> Danny is a firefighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9871.895s">A</a> number of nephews on the fire department as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9874.878s">Tom</a> was a great guy, a good stand-up member of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9877.539s">He'll</a> be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9878.42s">He's</a> been taken from us too soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=9880.341s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues join me in offering sincere and deep consolences to the family during their time of need.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11440.791s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11442.293s">I'm</a> going to preface my statement by saying I'm very excited about the Green Line coming to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11447.237s">However,</a> the planning process is a very difficult one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11450.62s">So</a> with that being said, is there any indication that by putting these stops temporarily in the city of Medford that they'd have an impact on our annual MBTA assessment?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11465.692s">Confident</a> in that answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11467.558s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11467.838s">You're</a> confident with that answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11468.659s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11469.039s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11470.421s">Now,</a> ultimately, this is the route that you're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11472.663s">Boston</a> Ave, George Street, Main Street, Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11475.866s">Boston</a> Ave, College Street, George Street, Main Street, Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11477.707s">And</a> you're asking us to put five temporary stops in, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11482.051s">Four.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11486.075s">And</a> if we don't put them in, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11487.356s">Is</a> that still the route? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11488.284s">Is</a> the route still going to be the route, whether or not we put the temporary spots in or not?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11514.518s">Yeah,</a> but I mean, ultimately, this is the route. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11516.339s">This</a> is what you're going with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11517.179s">Regardless</a> of whether or not we give you these bus stops or not, this is the route you're going with.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11535.888s">OK,</a> because I mean, and looking at the 80 bus route and the direction that it goes in, and I'm pretty familiar with Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11540.931s">You</a> know, I worked in Ball Square for a long time for Charlie Shannon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11544.34s">pretty</a> familiar with the MBTA and the way the MBTA works, but ultimately, and I'm familiar with the 80 bus route because I'm from West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11550.362s">So</a> ultimately, if you look at this, right, you got a bus coming down Broadway and it gets to the Broadway Bridge and it can't go over it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11556.844s">But</a> right before Broadway, we have Cedar Street, which is an emergency way in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11560.685s">And</a> I don't understand why a bus couldn't be diverted down Cedar Street and then take a right on Morrison Ave and then be diverted right down Willow Ave and you'd be cutting out two blocks where the Broadway Bridge is instead of sending this thing for six miles through the city of Medford.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11580.652s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11589.377s">Cause</a> the Councilors in Medford are opposed to this plan right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11593.039s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11593.82s">So,</a> you know, ultimately, I guess Mark need a gang in his opinion about diverting this thing through Medford for this huge duration of what looks like one, two, three, four, five, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11603.112s">12</a> or 13 or 14 or 15 stops is the plan because the alderman in the city of Somerville was opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11608.577s">So</a> they're going to divert it through 15 stops with the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11611.419s">When</a> the bypass that I just gave you would bypass two stops in the city of Somerville and put it right back on track in the 80 track. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11617.123s">I'm</a> no engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11617.784s">I'm</a> no traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11618.624s">That's</a> what you guys are for. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11619.485s">You</a> guys are the big brains in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11620.986s">But</a> in looking at this thing, it doesn't look like it makes any sense to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11624.869s">So</a> ultimately, if we don't approve the temporary bus stops, you're still going to go full with this route. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11630.033s">So</a> this route's going to cause the impact on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11633.01s">If</a> we don't approve the bus stops, we don't approve the bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11636.352s">I</a> don't understand what the big deal is, but it doesn't look to me like the bus stops that they're putting in there are going to be servicing a Medford population that was previously using the 80 bus line anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11645.176s">So</a> I don't see anybody from the city of Medford being impacted negatively if we deny the temporary bus stops at this point in time, based upon what I can see on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11654.26s">I</a> think that the rerouting of the 80 bus and the route that you came up with is absolutely ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11659.662s">It</a> makes no sense to me whatsoever.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11667.628s">So</a> with that being said, I don't support the temporary bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11671.11s">The</a> route's going to be the route regardless. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=11672.851s">I</a> don't think we need to make any other amendments or altercations to it to allow for it to happen.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12156.438s">Todd,</a> you worked over in the City Assembly for a period of time, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12159.979s">Did</a> you work on this project at all?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12172.332s">The</a> planning stages of the Broadway bridge closure, or the planning stages of the geode?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12187.436s">And</a> Todd, can you tell us in terms of the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12189.997s">And</a> I know it's difficult for you to come in to this so late in the game, where the council had requested that we hire a traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12197.319s">I</a> think two budget cycles passed that we funded it before you got hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12201.014s">then</a> you got hired, and now you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12202.875s">So</a> as they like to say, the train was rolling down the tracks well before you got involved in this circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12209.679s">But</a> based upon your opinion, what type of feedback have you been able to give in terms of this route, in terms of the administration's position on this alternative route? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12220.484s">And</a> I mean, obviously, they signed off on it, so it must be something that they're supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12224.386s">But</a> I mean, from a traffic engineering standpoint, what challenges do you see if, in fact, this route does go through the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12230.797s">looking</a> at these roads, these major arterials, I guess they're called, you know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12237.362s">Oh,</a> minor, I'm sorry, minor arterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12240.164s">You</a> know, but ultimately Main Street has a significant parking situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12244.667s">One</a> thing we have to remember about Main Street, it's an emergency artery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12246.929s">All</a> these are emergency arteries, and our emergency arteries are swept once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12251.092s">So</a> there are parking restrictions that are already in place when the street sweeping program is implemented in the good weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12256.456s">So</a> with that being said, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12258.02s">What</a> type of feedback input have you had? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12260.642s">And</a> what type of coordination of efforts with the DPW has taken place to ensure that if this route does go through the city of Medford, which it sounds like it's going to do, that our day-to-day operations can continue in the fashion that they have in the past?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12308.429s">Who</a> was the person that was bringing or raising these concerns, these community residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12311.47s">Were</a> they community residents that lived in Somerville that was so wholeheartedly concerned about their neighbors over in Medford that they said, we better make sure this bus goes through Medford so that our Medford neighbors can get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12320.014s">We</a> don't want it to come down Cedar Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12321.894s">Or</a> were they people that lived in Medford and expressed the concern that said, I'm not going to be able to get access to my bus if I'm going to work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12340.486s">I</a> mean, there are a variety of special interest organizations in the community that are interested in certain things to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12345.39s">I</a> mean, we get that, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12346.651s">But</a> ultimately this is a quality of life issue for neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12349.433s">And</a> you know, if we're taking away three or four or five pocket spots in front of somebody's house so that we can put a bus there, that's going to temporarily temporarily service the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12356.038s">We're</a> going to have people that for a year, we're going to get used to taking the 80 bus and they're going to for a year, lose the pocket spots in front of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12361.942s">Then</a> God willing, this project gets finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12363.923s">That</a> bus is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12364.94s">Now</a> they gotta go say, oh, geez, well, that was convenient for a year, but now let me change my whole commuting style. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12369.232s">I</a> gotta figure out how to get in the 80 over in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12371.137s">Now</a> it's a mile and a half away down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12373.807s">You</a> know, I just don't think it makes sense, the route, but you're not here for the route, you're here for the bus stops, and I oppose the bus stops.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12487.866s">That'll</a> do it for me, sir.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=12915.062s">Motion</a> to deny the petition, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13170.24s">While</a> we're in petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 19-057, CPA Annual Report. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13175.043s">Annual</a> Review and Introduction of the 2019 Application Process.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13920.821s">Mr.</a> President, Councilor De La Russa took the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13923.583s">Ultimately,</a> this annual report is in line with the ordinance that the Community Preservation Commission Ad Hoc Subcommittee was able to author, one of which Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13932.229s">Cameron</a> and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13932.769s">Sierra</a> were members of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13934.71s">We've</a> reaped great benefits at this point in time as a community from the Community Preservation Act and the appropriations that we've made from the fund, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13941.875s">And</a> I'm very excited to see us go through a next round of grant funding proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13946.416s">But</a> I'm also very excited to learn about these changes that we've made to the application process, especially the coordination of efforts between city departments and applications for city land. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13956.82s">So</a> with that being said, thank you, Roberta. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13958.38s">And</a> thank you to the members of the CPC for their hard work and dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13963.361s">This</a> started out as an idea that turned into a ballot question that turned into a reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13967.563s">So</a> it's really something that I've been happy to be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=13970.003s">And</a> I want to thank you for the work that you put into it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14306.65s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14307.875s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14309.536s">This</a> has been a topic that's been discussed a number of times at the council rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14313.419s">There</a> have been individuals that have circulated petitions to save certain trees that are located on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14320.505s">And</a> what this <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14322.697s">resolution</a> is as a request for the city solicitor to draft a zoning ordinance that would define what a certain protected tree would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14330.42s">In</a> some communities, they would define a protected tree as a tree that is 12 or 18 inches in diameter at four feet in height level. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14340.183s">And</a> in order to remove a tree on private land that meets that requirement, they'd have to go through a permitting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14345.826s">And</a> as a requirement of the permit, you'd have to come up with a plan to replace the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14350.733s">to</a> replant the tree at a different location or to pay into a tree replacement fund to ensure that the community can continue to maintain the number of trees that it has grown accustomed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14361.16s">We</a> all know the benefits that trees bring in terms of environment, also curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14365.964s">So</a> I thought that this was a step in the right direction for us to begin vetting a process, Mr. President, to protect the trees and private canopy of trees in the community of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14376.731s">There</a> are a number of communities that have done this, Brookline, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14380.213s">Newton,</a> Cambridge, for example, I've taken the liberty of forwarding copies of draft ordinances from other communities to the city solicitor in anticipation that my council colleagues would support this endeavor and asking him this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14393.457s">So</a> with that being said, I would ask my council colleagues to support this resolution asking that the solicitor draft us an ordinance for proper review and vetting that would govern the removal of trees on private property and establish replacement requirements thereof.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14507.452s">Mr.</a> President, that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14508.772s">Councilor</a> Delaro was always correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14510.153s">And</a> when I brought this forward, one of the things I was thinking of was <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14514.11s">a</a> lot of land across the street from the gas station on Winthrop Street, for example, where there were 50 or 60 trees there that were clear-cut for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14520.574s">And</a> those trees are not going to be replaced back into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14523.436s">Those</a> trees are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14524.617s">The</a> development never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14525.918s">So</a> now we have a gigantic, blown-out rock wall that looks like it's a rock-climbing wall over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14531.261s">All</a> the beautiful trees that were there are gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14533.442s">It's</a> a main thoroughfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14534.423s">The</a> trees were helping our environment in terms of pollution because of the amount of cars that travel down Route 68. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14539.286s">So,</a> yes, Councilor Dello Russo would govern. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14544.917s">the</a> demolition of trees on private property and it would define a certain protected tree as one having certain characteristics or criteria relative to its size.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14663.313s">In</a> my reading and researching of this in other communities, nothing in the proposed ordinance or the intent of this proposed ordinance would preclude somebody from doing whatever they want with a tree on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14673.455s">What</a> it would do is require them to either pay into a fund to get a permit to remove the tree or to produce a plant of the tree wood that would be sufficient enough to satisfy her needs in terms of this replacement tree would, again, one tree's gone, one tree's up, it's a one for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14688.541s">If</a> they can't put the tree on, relocate the tree, or replant a tree on their private property, then they could pay into a tree replacement fund to the city, and the city could use that to enhance its streetscape, and it would be a funding mechanism thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14699.484s">But</a> I can certainly understand Councilor Dello Russo's concerns about this, because it does infringe upon the liberty of private residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=14705.105s">That's</a> why I'd like the city solicitor to go through the process of drafting an ordinance, and we'll have the opportunity to properly vet it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15090.914s">Mr.</a> President, in the research that I've been able to perform relative to other communities that have implemented this, some other communities have put criteria on it based upon the duration of home ownership to ensure that an individual that's applying for a permit to remove a tree isn't a developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15105.265s">They</a> can show that they've lived at the property for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15108.827s">Nothing</a> in the ordinance, again, would preclude somebody from removing a tree that was on their private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15113.091s">It</a> would just establish a certain criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15115.292s">for</a> us to establish a funding mechanism to replace trees in the community that are taken down on private properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15122.117s">As</a> everybody likes to say, there are two things that nobody wants to see be made in this world, a sausage and a law. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15127.161s">That's</a> why we asked the city solicitor to draft this and then we'll have an opportunity to vet it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15130.884s">I</a> asked my council colleagues to allow the solicitor the opportunity to come up with a draft ordinance for us to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15135.968s">And</a> if we can reach a consensus for something that works for this community, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15139.851s">If</a> not, that's okay too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15141.072s">That's</a> what we have.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15364.172s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, we're debating the merits of an ordinance or a draft ordinance that doesn't exist at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15369.494s">That's</a> why I've asked that the council support me in asking Solicitor Rumley to draft something for us to review, at which time all of these valid and salient points can be addressed and vetted properly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15436.257s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15436.757s">Mr.</a> President, the gentleman has debated this issue vigorously, more so than the sponsor of the resolutions put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15443.52s">With</a> that being said, again, I would ask that the solicitor be given the opportunity to vet it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15447.761s">Obviously,</a> he has the opportunity to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15452.387s">which</a> he has not offered an amendment on, and he has the opportunity to vote against the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15455.77s">I</a> would ask that the paper be brought to a vote, and the gentleman can vote which way he sees fit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15489.826s">Mr.</a> President, if I could finish my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15493.288s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15494.168s">We</a> are the legislative body, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15543.695s">Mr.</a> President, I mean, at this point, I think it's moot, because the paper's been withdrawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15546.415s">We'll</a> reintroduce that at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15547.955s">That's</a> fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15556.077s">We'll</a> reintroduce it next week with language.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15693.213s">The</a> special permit, when granted, would go to the business and not to the actual address. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15698.514s">If</a> we grant the permit to the address, we'd need to go forward and rescind the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15702.095s">But</a> if the business changes hands, then the new business would have to come before the council and, again, reapply for that special permit, whether it be signage, extended hours, a drive-through window, or whatever it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15712.798s">This</a> council and past councils have found that to be a best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15716.258s">So</a> what I was wondering was, based upon the language of Chapter 48, Section 5 in the Special Permit Granting Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15723.443s">that's</a> outlined in our zoning regulations, I think it's 22094. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15725.885s">Can</a> the council adopt a standing rule in the council rules that would attach this condition to every permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15734.672s">Every</a> permit that's requesting special permit granting authority before the council would come in here and it would be submitted under the fact or under the criteria that it's going to be with the business and not with the address so that we don't have to go through the procedural process of attaching that motion every time we adopt a rule and that's attached automatically <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15751.767s">When</a> the paper comes up for council action, it's taken up under council rule 37A, which says that this condition is automatically attached to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15760.029s">We</a> wouldn't be precluded from attaching other restrictions to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15763.869s">And</a> we also wouldn't be precluding from waiving restriction from waiving that entirely. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15767.97s">But</a> it was something that I wanted to ask the city solicitor in an official capacity as to whether or not the council does have the authority to take this action by an amendment of its rules and require that all applications for special permits that are submitted <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15779.083s">to</a> the council that are under council purview have this condition attached to it by way of rule, as opposed to by way of motion from the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15785.75s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15954.981s">Mr.</a> President, I'm hoping Councilor Caraviello can help me out in understanding how citizens here in the city of Medford that want to enjoy the Christmas lights on City Hall can look at them if we're going to take the Adirondack chairs out from the Riverside Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15969.106s">Where</a> else are they supposed to sit to look at the beautiful Christmas lights that we have on here at City Hall? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15979.794s">But</a> then no one's going to be able to see the beautiful lights we have on at City Hall still for Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15987.24s">Maybe,</a> Mr. President, we could also request that the Christmas lights at City Hall be removed in the interest of energy and environment? <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=15994.18s">So</a> I would like to amend the paper and also request that the city administration take the appropriate steps to remove the Christmas lights in front of City Hall so that we no longer look like the Griswolds.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00000049&t=16240.321s">Second.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI/2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI.html">City Council Meeting 05/22/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1225.453s">Do</a> you believe we have a meeting on the Community Preservation Act, which would be tomorrow evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1230.135s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1231.075s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1231.295s">Maybe</a> we can get the applicants to come, the reappointment candidates to come to that meeting as they're probably going to be there to present anyway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1660.993s">Councilor</a> Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1662.053s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1663.874s">This</a> is an environmental justice area, so upgrades to our public park in this area I think is going to be valuable to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1671.188s">I</a> do have a question though. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=1672.989s">Would</a> the acceptance of the grant preclude us from expanding our community guidance program at this public park?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2045.553s">Councilor</a> Nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2046.633s">Mr.</a> President, I support the paper wholeheartedly as amended and move approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2237.214s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2238.674s">Mr.</a> President, in our packet this evening, we do have some papers from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2241.876s">And</a> if we look at these papers from the mayor, we'll see that the council had voted to create a fire station donation account. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2248.912s">The</a> council had voted to create a police and fire donation account. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2252.254s">The</a> council had voted to complete a police, fire, and library donation account, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2258.499s">The</a> administration has supported this measure that the council has brought forward, and this is what it takes to execute such. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2264.623s">So</a> I would move for approval of the paper, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2652.207s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the paper and request also that a copy of the RFP that was approved by the school committee, once it is issued, be forwarded forthwith to the council for review as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2846.391s">Mr.</a> President, the trade that the council passed was to <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2849.617s">put</a> a hold on the appropriation of the funds for 45 days so that the council could further investigate financial opportunities to keep this proposal on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2857.842s">What</a> we've been able to find out is that it's really a $1.1 million problem for EM, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2862.345s">We</a> have three years of debt exclusion, I mean, three years of debt and debt service that needs to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2868.989s">And</a> if we can find $1.1 million annually, we can keep this project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2874.172s">There's</a> been a lot of discussion about other outside-of-the-box ideas that we can pursue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2878.015s">in</a> order to keep this project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2879.596s">And</a> that's the goal of this council, that's the goal of this councilor anyway, I wanna speak for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2884.28s">But</a> my goal and my commitment is to keep this on track and to be sure that we have a new police and a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2891.125s">And</a> if we're not moving forward on anything, then we're never gonna get either one of those things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2897.129s">So</a> what made me move forward on this paper was the stark reality that a financial situation in the community right now doesn't allow for us to maintain <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2907.495s">based</a> on the use of tax dollars through taxation in our operating budget to keep this project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2914.02s">So</a> now we need to come up with some outside-of-the-box ideas to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2917.483s">Councilor</a> Scarpelli's come forward with a great idea concerning debt exclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2921.166s">I've</a> requested a report from the administration for the disposal of surplus properties to other individuals in the community to put them back on the tax rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2931.274s">And</a> I am committed to continue to meet until we can come up with a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2936.071s">properly</a> fund this project so that it stays on track, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2939.354s">So</a> the reason that I have moved forward and said that it's appropriate for us to go forward with the police station is because the 45-day review was concluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2946.22s">We've</a> examined options. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2947.261s">We</a> have options. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2948.562s">And</a> I'm looking forward to pursuing those. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2951.484s">You</a> know, we have the training tower that we need to focus on, but we also have the big three buildings that we want to get built, the library, the police station, and the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2958.49s">Keeping</a> those on track is my priority, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2960.672s">And</a> if we don't move forward and we remain stagnant in one area, then we're never going to move forward <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2965.177s">So</a> I can certainly understand the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2966.838s">You</a> know, I consider Mr. Buckley a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2970.059s">And</a> although, you know, maybe this issue right here is taking a personal turn, you know, I can certainly say that at the end of the day, I will be committed to continuing to work towards the ultimate goal of keeping this project on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2982.644s">You</a> don't have to be happy with my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2984.025s">I</a> already know you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2985.445s">But</a> with that being said, that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2987.106s">And</a> that's why I'm casting a vote this evening in favor of demolition of the training tower in the police academy building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=2992.465s">so</a> that we can move forward and allow the police station to be built based upon the plans that have been put forth and the $2 million that this council's already appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3000.77s">When</a> we look at the plans and the design of the police station, we've seen that the police have made concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3005.552s">They've</a> eliminated their gun range as part of the plan so that they can move forward on this project, and I think right now we're at a point in time where we've remained very stagnant with some of our buildings in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3014.557s">We've</a> ignored these buildings in our community, and we are not gonna be able to get out of this issue and out of this problem <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3020.018s">by</a> using our operating funds from our day-to-day operational budget to continue to fix these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3025.921s">We're</a> putting good money after bad money when it comes down to it, so we need to take a long, hard look at what we can do to reconstruct both of these facilities for our public safety personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=3033.884s">I'm</a> committed to doing that, and I'm committed to keeping this on track, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6653.377s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6654.318s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6655.52s">We</a> do have a committee of the whole scheduled for tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6657.843s">We</a> can report this paper out tomorrow evening if we feel comfortable with the presentations that are made that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6662.931s">I</a> as one councilor do not support taking just one item out of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6667.72s">I,</a> as one councilor, would support the measure provided that we have a presentation tomorrow in its entirety over the paper that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6677.863s">I</a> don't see a timing issue in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6679.224s">I</a> think there are also concerns and questions about who's going to manage this money, how they're going to be sure these benchmarks are made, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6684.445s">And</a> I want to hear that from the parties that pick one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7065.499s">Mr.</a> President, I request that, um, uh, community preservation commission provide us with copies of the applications as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7502.835s">Point</a> of information, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7504.457s">That's</a> why we're having the meeting, to have the presentation, so that we can determine what we want to fund and what we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7510.682s">I</a> personally, as one counsel, wouldn't have any problem making a tentative report of the matters that we reported out favorably and the matters that we keep in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7517.447s">And</a> that tentative report can go out to the powers that be, the purchasing department, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7521.124s">You</a> know, to get the bid ready and get the bid prepared, tomorrow night, as early as tomorrow night, we can make a committee report together and report out portions of this paper favorably and unfavorably with those recommendations to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7532.731s">They</a> can still move forward and begin to prepare the bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7535.412s">Then</a> once the money's released, I mean, all we're doing is releasing the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7539.035s">They</a> have the money already. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7540.33s">So</a> when they get their first bill, then they pay the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7543.072s">But</a> I don't think that us not appropriating the money, us appropriating the money absent the committee of the whole that's been scheduled for this absolute distinct purpose, especially in the age of transparency and openness that my council colleagues like to talk about so much, is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7560.286s">I</a> think that moving forward, we can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7562.467s">We</a> can put out a committee report tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7564.029s">It's</a> a tentative committee report that we all support. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7566.18s">and</a> get the powers that be to be aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7568.061s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7568.501s">This</a> is the tentative committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7570.261s">We're</a> going to send it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7571.061s">It's</a> going to be engrossed by the, it's going to be adopted by the council at the next council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7575.863s">These</a> people will know what's going on and they'll know tomorrow night or the day after.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7676.408s">Said</a> when school's out and the summer's here, there will be a period of time where that <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7682.103s">school</a> yard, which, as you said, has been used as a playground, will be inaccessible to the individuals in the neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7689.345s">So</a> there is a period of time that they will not be able to utilize.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7756.177s">This</a> isn't a punishment at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7757.498s">This</a> is just a request for transparency and openness, considering that the council president has set an agenda for us, and that agenda includes a committee of the whole, and this appropriation, that's tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7767.576s">So</a> it's not an attempt to punish anybody, it's an attempt to make sure that we get the sufficient information to move forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7943.748s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7945.989s">Very</a> recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7947.153s">weeks</a> and years this council has taken advantage of the ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7951.434s">And</a> Councilor Marks earlier this evening ironically had spoken a little bit about the amount of time that it's taken us to implement the master plan in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7960.197s">So</a> here we are, we have a master plan for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7962.577s">We've</a> had meetings, we have a focus group that's met and it's discussed some of the things that they'd like to see happen in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7969.489s">We</a> get a presentation from the Massachusetts Area Planning Council that discusses Medford Square and what direction this information and data has driven them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7978.154s">And</a> then it goes quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7980.536s">And</a> I think that, Mr. President, one thing that we have all talked about in the past is trying to revitalize our downtown business districts by putting together an ad hoc committee that's made up of representatives of the administration, the council, and the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7994.798s">of</a> getting people together at the table to move forward and try to implement something that we've been looking at for the better part of a decade and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8002.644s">So</a> with that being said, I think it's a rather self-explanatory resolution, and I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8034.893s">The</a> airport navigation system, Mr. President, has been creating so much controversy in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8041.037s">But</a> apparently, the good weather has finally come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8044.419s">And</a> as such, many windows in neighborhoods are being opened, and fresh air is being blown in houses, as well as a lot of fresh noise from the airplanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8053.299s">So,</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm requesting that we get a report back from our representatives from Mass Board as to what's going on with the RNAV situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8061.787s">I</a> am aware that Congressman Capuano has filed an amendment to the congressional budget that would address some of the RNAV concerns, and I'm hoping that we can be brought up to speed on that as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8080.287s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8088.369s">There's</a> too many people on that.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8108.181s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8109.181s">What</a> I'm going to do is defer to Councilor Scarpelli on this because he's taken such ownership of it earlier in his passionate plea to the membership of 1032. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8118.148s">But</a> ultimately this is an effort for us to further examine the debt exclusion option to maintain that our fire department remains on track and that the commitments that were made are kept.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8279.227s">Councilor</a> Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8279.868s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8282.149s">This</a> is an issue that's going to need a lot of community input and involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8286.973s">I</a> certainly would be happy to commit to putting parameters on this before the matter is addressed to the City Council, before the matter is brought to the City Council floor, whether it's a series of public hearings, public meetings, or so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8297.177s">So</a> with that being said, I guess the request would be to get the solicitor to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8302.281s">That</a> doesn't mean that it's going to hit the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8303.763s">We're</a> just going to get a response from the solicitor and we'll have to reintroduce that if we're going to be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8308.406s">So</a> I want that to be clear that this isn't an attempt for us to take this and put this on the ballot this evening, but what it is is an attempt for us to get the language that's appropriate from the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8316.813s">So</a> if it's something that we do want to move forward, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8319.902s">the</a> matter locked and loaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8321.302s">But</a> if it does make my colleagues more comfortable, and even if it doesn't, I think that what we need to do is have an open and transparent process where we go and, what do we like, the travel and road show, as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8330.704s">Maybe</a> we have to go out to the community and go to a couple of places and talk about this and have some meetings and public hearings and gather public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8337.345s">I</a> know that my colleagues would support any effort to get out in the community and hear what people have to say about this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8343.906s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I just want to make that clear that this isn't something that I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8349.159s">trying</a> to bring to the floor the next time that the response comes back, but that this is something that we're going to have to use as a tool to go out into the community and to educate people before we bring this to the floor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8634.675s">And</a> this is a ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8635.935s">So</a> it goes to the ballot for the voters to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8640.096s">It's</a> not like we're going to pass this and say, what's the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=8643.096s">And</a> then it's in effect, it has to go to the ballot for the voters to decide.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9408.077s">I</a> move to take paper 18414 off the table, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9411.88s">This</a> is a request for the <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9415.95s">House</a> Bill 3610, commonly known as the Red Flag Bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9420.331s">Our</a> House Ways and Means Committee is going to be taking this paper up within the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9426.612s">The</a> Red Flag Bill is aimed at reducing gun violence by establishing another tool for public safety in a way of closing dangerous loopholes related to gun licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9436.635s">What</a> it does, Mr. President, it allows a family member, a roommate, or a law enforcement official to petition the court to bar someone from owning a firearm. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9444.694s">if</a> their gun ownership presents a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9451.077s">This</a> legislation is supported, Mr. President, by the Massachusetts Police Chiefs Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9456.599s">The</a> House Committee on Public Safety has endorsed passage of this bill on April 13, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9462.161s">The</a> governor is weighed in on the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9464.962s">The</a> Speaker of the House is weighed in on the bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9467.003s">However,</a> I think that this is something that we need to do to make sure that our community is a safer place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9472.064s">I</a> know some of my colleagues do have concerns about the Second Amendment rights of individuals in this community and whether or not this piece of legislation is something that they're willing to support, and I can wholeheartedly understand that and support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9485.529s">As</a> an attorney at Law Council, Alongo has taken an oath to uphold the tenets of the federal and state constitutions, and this is something she might not be comfortable supporting, and I understand that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9495.872s">But</a> with that being said, time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9498.053s">The</a> legislative session is closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9499.473s">It</a> is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9500.233s">It's</a> going to be closing relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9503.025s">The</a> House Ways and Means Committee is set to take this paper up this week, so time is of the essence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9507.607s">It</a> was put on the agenda for the May 8th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9511.809s">It</a> was tabled so that a copy of the actual text of the bill could be provided to my colleagues on the council, because I neglected to do that when filing the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9520.734s">I</a> had forwarded that information to my council colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9523.395s">They've</a> had it for a number of days now, Mr. President, so I'd ask to move forward on the resolution, and I would request my council colleagues' support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=9535.682s">Send</a> a letter of support to a state delegation in the House Ways and Means Committee saying that we support the red flag bill, House Bill 3610.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3694.692s">Tonight,</a> Mr. President, I'd just like to further amend the paper and request that the members of the Medford Housing Authority Board be copied on anything that goes forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3738.615s">I</a> just further amended the paper, Mr. President, asking that any correspondence that comes out of the council would also be sent to the Medford Housing Authority Commission.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3830.888s">From</a> a procedural standpoint, Mr. President last week, this council <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3834.543s">had</a> a discussion on use variances and whether or not there was a vagueness surrounding the city's ability to apply use variances through their Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3843.526s">The</a> same question was raised in August of 2016 and was answered by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3848.387s">As</a> such, I made a resolution requesting that we adopt the city solicitor's opinion and direct the city clerk to make the appropriate changes to our codified ordinances, as it was the opinion of the city solicitor that this codification was done in error in 2001 <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3861.892s">and</a> that use variances in the community of Medford were never precluded or barred. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3865.535s">As</a> such, Mr. President, we took a vote to table the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3867.936s">That</a> vote failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3869.498s">From</a> a procedural standpoint, the matter was then section 22, which is a unilateral table. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3875.222s">When</a> the matter is unilaterally tabled and comes up the next week, this is next week, I'd move for approval on the request that the Medford City Council adopt the city solicitor's opinion, rendered in paper 16-589, and that we direct the city clerk to take the appropriate action to correct our codified ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3892.928s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3919.697s">We're</a> going to have a committee of the whole to ask whether or not we should eliminate use variances, but ordinances say that use variances are already precluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3928.941s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn asked a question as to how this could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3931.862s">The</a> city solicitor came back and told us that it was an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3934.443s">Let's</a> correct the error and then we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jATtLoh7en8&t=3936.044s">But</a> now we're working with a document that's been edited.<h2><a href="../2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM/2018-02-28_cWHRmg4nTSM.html">Medford City Council 02/27/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2483.052s">Mr.</a> President, just in my reading of the resolution, be it resolved the Medford School Committee immediately review and revise the Medford Public Schools rental policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2490.297s">That's</a> already been voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2491.538s">They</a> are going to do that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2492.919s">So</a> we'll take that language out. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2494.18s">Be</a> it resolved the Medford School Committee immediately only permit school and community sponsored events. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2499.463s">That's</a> what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2500.023s">That's</a> a directive more than a suggestion to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2502.524s">With</a> that being said, I have no problem with the gentleman bringing the matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2505.925s">I'm</a> in opposition to it for a theoretical reason, not for any other reason more. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2509.706s">The</a> school committee implements policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2511.626s">The</a> school committee makes policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2512.746s">The</a> superintendent's in charge of executing that policy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2516.047s">I</a> think we should let the school committee have an opportunity to do their job and do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2520.308s">And</a> I rest my case at that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2594.138s">What</a> if information comes tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2595.958s">Quite</a> frankly, it could have been anybody that has access to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2598.699s">Anybody</a> that has a key to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2599.799s">Anybody</a> that's an employee to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2601.119s">It</a> could be anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2602.319s">And</a> we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2602.899s">And</a> the council is absolutely correct about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2604.46s">And</a> that's why there is an investigation that's pending. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2606.42s">And</a> when we have the information that we need to proceed, we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2610.141s">But</a> it's not even we. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=2611.041s">It's</a> the school committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3269.074s">One</a> information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3270.755s">Just</a> last week, the council did vote to request that the administration issue an RFP <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3277.995s">hire</a> an independent security expert to perform an assessment, a safety and security assessment at all our public buildings, which includes our public schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3285.838s">So</a> I can't agree with you more wholeheartedly, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3288.159s">Nuzzo,</a> when you say about needing a holistic approach and not taking a piecemeal approach to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=3291.501s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4340.208s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4341.209s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4341.709s">Mr.</a> President, just a brief bit on Joe Small. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4345.39s">Mr.</a> Small was a lifelong Medford resident, longtime firefighter, very involved in the professional firefighters of Massachusetts, one of the founding members to help bring workplace safety and occupational health initiatives forward as an organization through organized labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4360.822s">Mr.</a> President, he's going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4362.803s">He</a> was a good man, a good citizen in the city of Medford, a great grandfather, and someone that put himself before others to ensure their safety in the workplace. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4370.529s">So</a> he will be sadly missed, and I offer my condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/cWHRmg4nTSM&t=4372.59s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=371.118s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=372.419s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper with a B paper and request that the administration report back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=378.25s">What</a> the process is for permitting fields at this point in time, Mr. President, usually it goes before the parks board. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=383.415s">The</a> parks board meets once a month when they have a quorum, and then permits are issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=387.078s">And</a> I don't think it's the most effective or efficient process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=389.78s">Here</a> we have a recreation department with a budget of $315,000 annually that hopefully will be up and running sometime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=396.966s">And</a> the way that we're permitting our fields I don't think is going to be conducive to the best use and the best possible practices that we can do at the municipal level, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=403.561s">So</a> I'm asking that the administration conduct a review of the permitting process for their fields and provide recommendations as to how we can improve that to maybe a weekly permitting process as opposed to a monthly permitting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=412.743s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3611.353s">Superintendent</a> Belson, now we have the STARS program, and what would the normal reporting process be in the STARS program if a situation like this occurred?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3748.448s">I</a> was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3749.588s">I</a> was there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3793.568s">And</a> Mr. Belson, if this incident had occurred when school was in session, what would the response have been?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3808.577s">In</a> terms of identifying failures in the reporting system, I think that this has been opened up as a failure in the reporting structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3815.581s">And</a> where's the biggest failure that you've identified thus far in terms of the reporting structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3819.683s">Is</a> it between the cleaning contact crack to giving it to the senior custodian, the senior custodian not reporting it to the principal appropriately?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3837.805s">And</a> I guess the next question is, what are the next steps that we can hear from so that we can be assured that this isn't going to happen again?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3884.684s">Do</a> you have any knowledge as to whether or not the school committee is going to continue to allow rental opportunities to outside organizations in our schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3890.508s">Is</a> this something they're going to be looking at from a policy standpoint?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3929.337s">No,</a> and I'm not asking for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3931.178s">I</a> don't want to see a knee-jerk reaction to address an issue in the community that I think needs a long hard look. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3939.402s">And</a> I can certainly appreciate how candid you are this evening, and thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3943.145s">That</a> does it for my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=3944.626s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8893.4s">We</a> did that already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.217s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8948.657s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=8949.697s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like the record to reflect that I recuse myself from voting on this subject matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9267.432s">Mr.</a> President, the question that I asked the city solicitor was because we had an existing ordinance in place that exempted private clubs from the public smoking ban, how could the board of health pass a regulation that would be contrary to the ordinance that the legislative body had passed in 2007? <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9285.525s">So</a> my question was whether or not the process and procedure was appropriate and whether or not the board of health had the authority to make the unilateral heavy handed action that they made and they do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9294.861s">This</a> issue has to come back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9296.844s">If</a> we want to allow smoking in private clubs right now, it is authorized. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9301.03s">If</a> we want to ban that, that is a matter that has to come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9303.834s">It's</a> a legislative affair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9304.996s">It's</a> not something that can be done regulatory, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9307.579s">So</a> my concern was that when this was implemented, it was implemented inappropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9312.529s">And</a> I think that the city solicitor concurs with my opinion, and I also think that his opinion wasn't requested when the Board of Health went forward and made this action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9321.651s">So,</a> in an effort to make sure that everything was done above bar, Mr. President, to be sure that we were in compliance with the law, I asked the question to the solicitor as to whether or not this process was handled appropriately, and whether or not the Board of Health had the authority to do it, because there was an existing statute in place already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9533.638s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's also important to point out nothing in our ordinance requires private clubs to allow smoking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9539.842s">And</a> the exemption only exempts private clubs from the public smoking ban, but it doesn't say that they don't have the ability to police themselves either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9548.688s">So</a> I certainly understand Firefighter Brennan's, Captain Brennan's position on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9553.411s">I</a> don't particularly care for smoking in places either. <a href="https://youtu.be/Gg6yNgxPzRA&t=9556.353s">However,</a> my concern when I brought the question forward was whether or not it was handled appropriately and whether or not it was done within a fashion that was in the scope of their authority.<h2><a href="../2017-12-19_AW1lkvnNQcg/2017-12-19_AW1lkvnNQcg.html">Medford, MA City Council   Nov  28, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=861.345s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=862.325s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=863.606s">I</a> think we're all in agreement that we understand and value the importance of a bus shelter, especially at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=868.849s">And</a> the task that's before us here is how are we going to get it put there? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=872.601s">And</a> Councilman Scarpelli made a great recommendation to send it to the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=876.124s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper and also have it sent to the administration, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=879.747s">And</a> I'd like to ask the administration to discuss mitigation strategies in relation to the number of mass DOT projects that are going on in the community to help fund this. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=888.792s">some</a> impact going on with the erection of the cell phone towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=892.195s">We</a> have some impact going on with the extension of the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=895.158s">We</a> have some impact going on with the development of the Craddock Bridge that are all under MassDOT control, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=900.623s">And</a> it's not unusual when projects are going on in communities that mitigation of this sort is extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=905.487s">So</a> I'd also like to ask that the paper be sent to the administration with the request that they discuss mitigation with the MassDOT to provide funding or construction of such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1137.982s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.523s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1138.783s">Also</a> where the MBTA is a quasi public agency underneath the mass dot umbrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1142.765s">I</a> think it will be appropriate to amend the paper further and ask that this also be sent to a state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1147.008s">So</a> they're aware of the request that the council's making.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1570.726s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1571.727s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1573.948s">When</a> it comes to municipal aggregation, this is a topic that I think we've been discussing now for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1578.671s">And</a> quite frankly, the ball's in the council's court to determine whether or not this is something that we're going to allow the city to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1585.596s">And</a> again, I think the time to move forward on it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1589.238s">Ultimately,</a> the question is, do we want <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1591.209s">to</a> request the department head to dedicate resources to something that hasn't been approved yet by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1597.394s">We're</a> asking a department head to say, start creating a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1600.057s">We</a> may or may not adopt municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1603.66s">And</a> I think we're putting the cart before the horse, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1605.522s">If</a> we want to explore municipal aggregation, let's explore municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1608.284s">Let's</a> take the vote and let's allow it to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1611.647s">But</a> to dedicate resources to something that may or may not happen, I don't feel comfortable doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1618.003s">the</a> Director of Energy and Environment to start to begin to create an opt-out list. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1622.204s">So</a> she's going to dedicate resources in her office towards something that we may not adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1628.226s">So</a> I think that this might be a little bit counterintuitive at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=1631.547s">Mr.</a> President, I'll have a difficult time supporting it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2732.927s">Councilor</a> Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2733.848s">So</a> this is, Mr. President, when we met with Evisuos, one of the things that Councilor Marks brought up was that there's a memorandum of understanding that was negotiated for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2743.814s">And</a> that this isn't related to that meeting then. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2745.555s">Because</a> one of the requests that Councilor Marks made was that the items that were brought to the table and denied, we wanted to know what those were as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2751.919s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2752.279s">So</a> this is for the previous meeting, not the meeting that we just had the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.461s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2755.561s">Sounds</a> good to me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2820.42s">If</a> I may, Mr. President, I think the best approach would be to send it to Mr. Zamparelli from Eversource, who's the government relations person.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2835.101s">I</a> believe I still have the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.263s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2837.764s">I</a> believe I still have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2838.845s">I'm</a> sorry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2840.186s">So</a> we negotiated a memorandum of understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2841.888s">And</a> as I understand the process, based upon my discussions, is that the Department of Public Utilities has approved the project's specifications in terms of the cost, the route. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2853.876s">the</a> stretch that it's going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2855.477s">And</a> the MOU was negotiated between the chief negotiator and the utility company for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2861.842s">And</a> what comes before us is the grant for access for right away to put the vaults in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2866.385s">If</a> we fail to approve those vaults, then the next step in the process would be that Eversource would appeal to the Department of Public Utilities because they're the ones that approved the project plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2875.992s">And</a> then the question comes as to whether or not DPU agrees to allow them to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2882.063s">And</a> if they do, then the terms of the MOU, I believe, become null and void. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2886.088s">So</a> that's a concern that we have as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=2887.55s">So</a> I think that that's something that we need to ask the city solicitor at the next meeting is whether or not the terms of the MOU become null and void if the grants right away aren't approved and DPU has to step in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4306.174s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4307.45s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4308.871s">I</a> can certainly agree with my colleagues that there are many needs in this community, and prioritizing these needs are vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4315.795s">And</a> that's why we get elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4319.817s">The</a> redevelopment of the Carriage House and the creation of the Shepard Brooks Estates to be a full-fledged function hall was part of the chart the course plan that was presented by Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4331.623s">It</a> was the last item that came before this council as part of the chart the course plan, and the council voted it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4338.604s">After</a> the council voted the plan down, Mr. President, about a year passed and the members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust came to the council and said, the carriage house is the key focal piece of our master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4349.329s">Regardless</a> of whether or not the council supports the master plan, the carriage house is the key focus of their master plan and what direction they want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4355.532s">They</a> want to utilize the carriage house in the area that the carriage house is on to make an economic catalyst for the Sheppard Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4363.326s">And</a> they came before us and they asked for this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4365.087s">And</a> we had a committee of the whole with Paul Mulkey and they had people come in and they had people do an assessment of this carriage house and tell us what it was gonna cost to tie it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4373.19s">And</a> we had a committee of the whole on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4375.471s">And</a> that was all we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4377.492s">And</a> now here we are, a winter's past, another winter's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4381.054s">And</a> the individuals at Shepherd Brooks Estates are here before us again this evening asking us for $200,000 to shore up the key piece and the key component of their master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4393.467s">Regardless</a> of whether or not we support the master plan, Mr. President, the carriage house is an essential part of the redevelopment of that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4401.176s">The</a> carriage house is the catalyst. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4403.959s">The</a> carriage house is also falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4405.882s">It's</a> a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4406.683s">I</a> mean, any one of us could go up there and if we look at it, it's not a carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4409.786s">It's</a> a shell of a building that's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4412.497s">But</a> that shell of a building does have historic significance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4415.579s">Week</a> in, week out, we talk about historic preservation, demolition delay, historic significance, historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4422.723s">This</a> is one of the most historic homes, I should say, because we do have the Royal House, we do have the Peter Tufts House, we do have some very historic properties in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4429.066s">But</a> this is by far the most beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4430.847s">It's</a> got 50 acres of land that surround it, and there are many opportunities and options up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4434.91s">And</a> I think one thing that we need to do is preserve the carriage house, because maybe, although we don't agree with the master plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4439.775s">I</a> think we can all agree that the Carriage House is a vital component to what's going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4444.176s">There</a> are many options and many opportunities for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4446.017s">And</a> we might have to go back to the drawing board on this master plan because the council hasn't funded it in the past and they may not fund it again in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4451.099s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4452.219s">But</a> what I do know is this, the Carriage House is vital to the economic success at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4456.861s">And</a> this evening I'm comfortable supporting a $200,000 free cash appropriation based upon the history and based upon the presentation that was given to us in the past, the presentation that was given to us last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4468.445s">And</a> quite frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4469.741s">the</a> vital need that we have in Sheppard Brooks Estates if we're going to turn it into an economic catalyst to maintain the carriage house, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/AW1lkvnNQcg&t=4474.982s">So</a> with that being said, um, I'm supportive of the paper this evening and I move for approval.<h2><a

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=511.879s">First</a> out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=512.879s">Thank</a> you, Henry. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=513.52s">Thank</a> you to the organizers for this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=514.96s">I</a> really appreciate the opportunity to get up here and speak to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=517.922s">My</a> name is Adam Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=519.022s">I'm</a> a candidate for reelection to the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=521.743s">I'm</a> number four in your ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=523.064s">And</a> I'd ask for your consideration on November 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=524.744s">Um,</a> a little bit about myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=527.466s">I</a> reside in West Medford with my wife, Alison and our sons, Ryan and Brendan, uh, Ryan's three and Brendan's one. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=532.868s">I'm</a> a product of the Medford public schools graduating from MHS in 1996. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=536.309s">I</a> then went on to earn a bachelor's degree in political science from Merrimack college. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=540.915s">and</a> a master's degree in public administration from Suffolk University. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=544.637s">I</a> have nearly 20 years' experience working in government, first for the late State Senator Charlie Shannon as his Director of Constituent Services, then as an organizer, a field representative, and a contract negotiator in the labor movement, and now as an arbitrator with the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=560.804s">It's</a> through these experiences that I've had the opportunity to work on many initiatives that have made a difference in our community, items like marriage equality, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=569.487s">affordable</a> health care, the long-term leasing of our skating rinks, Flint and La Conte, the school building assistance program, and the Greenland extension, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=578.291s">And</a> I think it's safe to say that in a city that has a $166 million operating budget and a council that's made $13 million worth of appropriations in the past two years, that qualifications and experience do matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=591.621s">I'm</a> very grateful to have earned your trust and to have had the opportunity to serve as your city councilor for the past four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=596.607s">And</a> since my election, I've always embraced the philosophy that results are more important than rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=601.31s">and</a> this has been a very successful council that's produced a number of results. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=605.051s">From</a> a legislative standpoint, I've worked with my colleagues to implement changes to our city ordinances that benefits our quality of life and improves the operation of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=614.393s">Successfully</a> fighting for measures that have reformed the vehicle for higher ordinance to better protect consumers, increased the legal age to purchase tobacco products in the community to protect our public health, <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=624.895s">the</a> implementation of a university accountability ordinance to safeguard our neighborhoods, and the wage theft ordinance to ensure proper distribution of tax dollars to public contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=634.458s">From</a> a financial standpoint, the city's on solid ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=637.339s">For</a> the first time in recent memory, the city's passed a unanimous budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=641.721s">We</a> have suitable reserves and an A++ bond rating, allowing us to borrow at low rates, and a capital plan allowing us flexibility to meet our demands and spending needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=651.484s">Today,</a> our streets are safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=654.865s">We've</a> reduced the speed limit on city streets to 25 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=658.128s">We've</a> created and funded positions in the budget to combat addiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=661.51s">We've</a> purchased 12 new police cars and critical equipment for our fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=665.934s">But</a> most importantly, we've appropriated $2 million for the design of a new police station and have a commitment to deliver new police and fire headquarter buildings by the year 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=673.32s">This</a> is a commitment that I will not forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=677.323s">We</a> have great schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=678.744s">Great</a> schools open a world of opportunity for both our kids and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=682.375s">and</a> I'm committed as a parent and as a city councilor to that end. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=686.298s">In</a> the past term, we've opened a new media center and a full service culinary arts program at MHS, expanded course offerings, implemented before school programs, and have the lowest class sizes in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=696.824s">In</a> the next term, I'll work with the school committee to further expand and strengthen our opportunities for our youngsters and to deliver a new public library to the city of Medford. <a

provide the basic but essential services that we rely on every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=713.188s">I've</a> made a commitment to that end, improving service delivery with the funding of 12 new pieces of equipment for our DPW, securing over $2 million for water mains to bolster our light abatement programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=724.431s">In</a> the next term, I'll push to build upon this progress by fighting for increased staffing levels, improving maintenance and upkeep of our sidewalks and roadways, and improvements to our transportation infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=735.014s">Vibrant</a> downtowns add to our economic stability and greatly contribute to the overall success of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=740.894s">We're</a> making great progress addressing this priority through initiatives that help make our business district thrive, like the public-private partnership to bring headline acts to Chevalier Auditorium, the construction of the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, the Riverside Plaza, and the Clippership Connector to generate foot traffic in our square, and most importantly, the master plan for the revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=760.089s">Next</a> term, I'll work with the stakeholders in our business district to ensure that we put that plan to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=765.253s">I'm</a> proud of the accomplishments that we've made just by working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=767.9s">We've</a> made safe streets, great schools, strong infrastructure, and vibrant downtowns our top priorities because these are the key to a strong quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=774.844s">But</a> there is more work to be done, and I would like to be a part of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=778.567s">I</a> believe I have the qualifications, the experience, and the knowledge of the issues to continue to make a positive impact on our community, and I'm asking you for the opportunity to continue to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=787.172s">My</a> name's Adam Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/o7jpBFH8Da0&t=788.073s">I'm</a> number four on the ballot, and I thank you very much for

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1671.362s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1671.822s">Kerr,</a> thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1673.863s">Um,</a> this project looks like it's going to expand the library to about 44,000 gross square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1679.486s">What</a> are we at right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1682.167s">29</a> 29 so it almost gives us almost double hopeful. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1685.829s">Not</a> quite, but close. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1687.309s">Um,</a> do you think that based on the current staffing levels, you have enough, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1691.193s">personnel</a> to operate the facility once it, if we're lucky enough to receive the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1696.26s">Do</a> we have enough staff and personnel?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1722.192s">Well,</a> I mean, I think that if you need the staff, you do the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1724.374s">And</a> that's not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1725.675s">And</a> looking at this, Mr. President, this is something that the council's requested on multiple occasions to have the administration pursue the Board of Library Commissioners grant funding to expand or construct a new library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1738.281s">If</a> we also look at this, Mr. President, this council and councils in the past have restored funding to allow us to be at a level where we can apply for the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1747.545s">We've</a> dealt with many maintenance and capital issues related to the library, the roof leaking, some gutters being blocked, and we've invested money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1755.189s">and</a> studies and so on and so forth as to how we're going to move forward and address the present day concerns with the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1759.951s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1761.052s">Um,</a> I think that this is a great approach and a great step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1765.213s">I</a> congratulate miss Kerr on her hard work in such a short time. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1768.595s">Being</a> the library director, we've been able to bring this to fruition and um, I really think it's, it's a great measure and it's something that I'm going to be supporting this, uh, this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=1776.879s">So</a> as such move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2202.241s">We</a> believe you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2506.291s">Um,</a> yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2507.752s">I</a> just, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2508.905s">I</a> wonder if they have a green incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2510.366s">Are</a> there any other incentives that are available for us to pursue to receive increased grant reimbursement or increased priority in receiving the grant?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2541.183s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2542.284s">Good</a> job guys.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2827.478s">Mr.</a> President motion to adopt the amendment as proposed by city solicitor motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2835.932s">Councilor</a> Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2982.864s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2985.685s">Mr.</a> President, the Medford historical district commission came before the Medford city council's subcommittee on zoning and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=2993.988s">They</a> have constructed a proposal to amend the current language of the Medford city ordinances that deal with demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3003.17s">Um,</a> the subcommittee met in the presentation was put on by the historical district commission and his chairman, Ryan Haywood, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3008.652s">uh,</a> members of the commission were in attendance, including, uh, miss Morris, I believe, who just walked out the door here, who was here for the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3015.375s">Um,</a> ultimately, Mr. President, this was a number of changes were being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3019.217s">The</a> subcommittee voted to send the proposal to the city solicitor, the office of community development and the building commissioners for recommendations and input. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3027.041s">Um,</a> prior to reporting the paper out of, uh, prior to reporting the paper to the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3031.383s">So</a> we were asking that the council adopt this committee report so that we could ask the questions, get that answer back and then provide you with more information at a later date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3062.775s">Today,</a> Mr. President, the community preservation act ordinance to develop the community preservation committee has reached its eligibility for third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3071.738s">And</a> I'd ask that paper one six, seven, six, six be taken off the table for its third reading this evening on the motion that we take 16-seven 66 off the table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3104.768s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=3105.508s">Doesn't</a> sound like it's too controversial.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4244.461s">Um,</a> Mr. President, motion to take any paper that's been on the table for six months or more and receive in place on file.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4251.774s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4306.278s">It's</a> been there for a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4307.058s">I</a> think it was a paper that was put forward by the previous administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4309.559s">It</a> was tabled by a previous council. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4310.96s">If</a> the administration has an interest in pursuing it, they should refile the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4313.941s">The</a> way I look at it, it shouldn't cloud up our agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4346.492s">Motion</a> to send to the mayor's office to- I have a question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4350.915s">I</a> mean, if the paper's been sitting on the table for a year, then nothing was ever reported out of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4356.012s">What</a> are we waiting on an answer for if we never were able to ask the question because the paper was tabled and never moved from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4362.013s">So</a> is the question that you're asking is to ask the administration whether?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4444.657s">It's</a> tabled indefinitely pursuant to council rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4446.638s">It</a> can't come up anyway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4452.981s">Receive</a> in place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4454.322s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4481.139s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4482.88s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4483.38s">I</a> believe in response to the February bomb threats, the superintendent of schools was presented with accommodation from <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4490.522s">the</a> Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents on how it was handled and the policy that was put in place after the fact, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4496.543s">I</a> believe there was also a press release or an article that was put out about that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4524.428s">It's</a> been there for six months and there has been a policy that's been adopted by the policymaking body that affects the school use facilities, the school committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4567.924s">It</a> was here September 20th, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4570.044s">Today</a> would be the 90th day. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4573.145s">They</a> get it by right after 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4576.986s">They</a> don't have to come back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4578.786s">They</a> get it constructively. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4580.327s">So</a> it's the council's actually not taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4582.707s">We're</a> sitting on it and we're letting them get the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4586.088s">The</a> question, because the matter was tabled, we wanted the question answered, but the question never got reported out of the, out of the council because the matter was tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4593.605s">So,</a> because the matter was tabled, the question was never reported out. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4595.806s">Because</a> the question was never reported out, we never got the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4598.226s">Because</a> we never got the answer, today is the 90th day. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4600.387s">I</a> have some concerns as to sitting on our hands and saying, let a constructive acceptance go through them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4607.708s">But,</a> you know, I'll certainly do what my council colleagues feel is appropriate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4613.869s">The</a> question was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4615.27s">I</a> have the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4617.479s">what</a> are the city council, what's the city's rights in terms of whether or not they grant or don't create the keynote license? <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4622.324s">And</a> then what happens if we say no, what comes next?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4627.188s">That</a> was the question that got tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4629.23s">I</a> believe a council one go table the matter because there was some opposition in the crowd and she wanted to see if there was some feedback that we could get. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4636.597s">And</a> then we all agreed to say, okay, let's get some feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4639.36s">We've</a> tried to get the feedback, but because the paper never went out, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4642.842s">The</a> motion that we get the question, the question never got sent to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4646.303s">So</a> because the question never got sent, we never got an answer, but off the table now, September 20th, October 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4651.925s">So</a> 90 days from the date that they were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4653.926s">So</a> it's a constructive acceptance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4657.407s">If</a> in fact, so what's the motion on the table?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4665.91s">Yeah,</a> I think that the way that we should, Mr. President, if I can recommend, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4673.245s">That's</a> exactly my concern because it's also included in the zoning act. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4676.206s">We</a> need to do something with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4679.986s">And</a> so I don't think we're gonna meet in two January.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4751.59s">I</a> don't think that the question was asked before the matter was tabled, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4755.895s">So</a> the matter was tabled, the debate was ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4757.678s">We</a> voted on the tabling of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4759.1s">The</a> question never got reported out because the question was asked after the matter was tabled, if I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4763.577s">Either</a> way, it's a matter that needs housekeeping for whatever reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4766.159s">It's</a> on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4766.78s">The</a> 90th day is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4767.921s">So</a> we need to make our mind up as to whether or not we want to allow a constructive table, return it to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4775.527s">If</a> it stays on the table, they're going to get a constructive approval of the license, but it might also open the city up to some legal ramifications because it's also included as part of a zoning act. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4783.614s">So</a> we need to give them a decision one way or the other.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4789.759s">He's</a> the petitioner.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4805.707s">But</a> nothing that doesn't preclude them from still pursuing relief through the zoning act and maybe holding us accountable in that regard, whether or not we're subject to litigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4814.643s">by</a> accepting a constructive approval of a matter that's also outlined in a zoning act, which says that we need to give a special permit to make a decision on it, might leave us open to some legal situation, Mr. President, some legal liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4830.788s">So</a> I think that the way to handle this would be, Mr. President, we can, I mean, I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4836.084s">majority</a> of the council was opposed to issuing the license, but if we don't do issue the light, if we don't issue the license, then we might be open to opening us up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4874.571s">The</a> first motion is to take the matter off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4876.331s">If</a> the council doesn't want to take the matter off the table, then that's fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4960.842s">point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4961.622s">I</a> think it's a two, it's a double edged sword him as the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4966.003s">Um,</a> the council has to act within 90 days of receiving the application and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4970.824s">If</a> we don't, they constructed, they, that's a constructive approval and they get the license. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4974.484s">But</a> then there's also a question is because it's included in the zoning act and it says that we need to make an action within those 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=4980.045s">If</a> we don't, is there a liability on the city for not acting?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5574.344s">So</a> as a B paper, chair recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5577.684s">I</a> think the question wasn't whether or not the gentleman was going to get his license constructively after 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/q5wtGZ49X-w&t=5582.185s">The</a> question was whether or not by the council being inactive on the matter, we're opening the city up to a liability in the courts of law.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=46.183s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to present this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=50.466s">I'm</a> proposing that the city change the structure of the sign department. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=54.688s">I</a> really think that the sign department should be a standalone division within the DPW and not a subdivision of the highway department. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=60.953s">Reason</a> being is it is a public safety department, Mr. President, and they need to ensure that there is proper installation and maintenance of our roadway control signs as well as the striping on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=71.139s">If</a> anybody's been paying attention to the last five or six meetings of the Medford City Council, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=75.448s">I</a> think it's safe to say that the topic of our conversation has been signage and has been the striping of our streets and the public safety issues that are surrounding those matters here in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=85.613s">And</a> I'm asking that the administration take a look at this issue and determine whether or not it's feasible to create a standalone sign shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=92.315s">The</a> sign shop is responsible for all of the signage that's put forth by the Traffic Commission, as well as the existing signs that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=99.559s">They're</a> in charge of all the signage at the schools as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=102.91s">a</a> large job, and what's happening is these individuals that are assigned to the sign shop being a subdivision of the highway division are being pulled away to handle other matters that are in the community, and then they're put back into the sign shop, pulled out of the sign shop, put back in the sign shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=116.975s">And</a> I think that it would make good sense to have a full-time, stand-alone sign and striping division within the DPW, Mr. President, so that these issues in our community can be addressed promptly and properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=129.039s">I</a> don't think we have had <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=131.365s">a</a> meeting yet when the good weather rolls around and we don't talk about when our sidewalks are going to be, our crosswalks are going to be striped, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=139.167s">And</a> I think that this would be a perfect remedy for that type of issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=142.848s">I'd</a> ask that my council colleagues support the measure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=218.575s">The</a> commissioner has been appointed and is no longer wearing the interim tag, as far as I've been informed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=297.647s">Again,</a> Mr. President, this is a resolution that asks that the administration examine the feasibility thereof, so there will certainly be issues that are going to surround this matter in terms of collective bargaining, contract negotiation, and whether or not it even is a feasible move or an option to make, and that's why I'm asking the administration to study it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=580.434s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=582.096s">I'd</a> like the Council to join me in congratulating these individuals for the fine <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=586.99s">legacy</a> that they've left behind them at Medford High School, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=590.631s">And</a> going through this list, we see a number of great student-athletes who have the blue and white running through their veins, who have done well in the classroom as well as on the athletic field, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=600.315s">And</a> as we go down the list, there is someone who I'd like to point out, and that's Martin Murphy Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=605.117s">Martin</a> Murphy, for as long as I can remember, has been one of the most generous and giving individuals in our community, whether it's for Community Day, for <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=615.06s">I</a> was going to second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=615.881s">I</a> know a number of the inductees and they are great athletes, Megan Richard, David Richard, and I also was coached by Lou Ruggiero as a
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=980.695s">Mr.</a> President, the subcommittee <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=982.633s">Membership</a> will be prepared to make a presentation tomorrow, and we will go over the changes word by word and compare and contrast them with the current and existing rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=992.362s">So</a> there will be nothing left out tomorrow at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=994.644s">We</a> will be absolutely 100% sure to go over every single word, period, comma, so on and so forth, so that everybody is well aware of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1003.552s">Hence</a> the purpose of the meeting, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1005.153s">That</a> is correct, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1006.274s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1049.639s">So,</a> um, that's Mr. President, that's why when the committee report this paper out on August 1st, 2016, um, we asked that the city clerk put the committee report together and gave it to the council probably five, six weeks in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1062.504s">Um,</a> but you know, we'll do the best we can with what we got to get it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1065.586s">I</a> can't make any promises that it's going to happen, Mr. President, but the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1068.857s">I</a> think that the meeting should go forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1077.087s">If</a> individuals that have questions, raise them, we will answer them and do our best to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1080.952s">And</a> if it's not appropriate to call for a vote, are there further changes that need to be deliberated in subcommittee, which I anticipate would be the case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1088.444s">more</a> or less a reform measure that would start a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1091.826s">And</a> I don't think that any of us on the subcommittee felt as though this was going to be a final product that came out of the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1097.43s">And</a> we felt as though this is probably something that we're going to have to take a look at a couple of other things before it went forward and became operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1103.594s">If</a> in fact that was the will of the council as a whole, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1106.616s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1191.616s">Mr.</a> President, this is something that didn't happen overnight, and this Rules Committee started meeting before I was a member of the Council, and then continued to meet when I became a Councilor, and then continued to meet after the composition of the subcommittee changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1208.565s">When</a> Councilor Camuso retired from public life and when you became the President, the composition of the subcommittee changed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1216.549s">So</a> this is something that started well before I was the Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1219.343s">It</a> went through my first term and was deliberated and discussed and it's been going on for the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1223.985s">We've</a> probably met. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1225.586s">Oh,</a> I think between the committee right now we've met seven or six times on these proposed rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1232.349s">Prior</a> to that, when Councilor Dello Russo and Camuso comprised the committee, I think we met another six times. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1237.751s">So</a> there's been at least 12 public meetings on <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1240.448s">the</a> subject and topic of rules in the Medford City Council rules to date, Mr. President, that I can recall since I've been on this council and this proposal is the fruit of that labor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1321.154s">It</a> hasn't even been adopted by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1324.056s">It's</a> on the council floor, but it hasn't been adopted by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1327.839s">It's</a> still in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1328.759s">The</a> subcommittee reported a paper out. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1330.2s">We're</a> going to have a meeting on this tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1332.362s">There</a> are going to be lots of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1333.462s">That's</a> what the meeting tomorrow is for, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1363.568s">Mr.</a> President, pursuant to the present Councilor, I'm going to clarify this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1423.501s">Point</a> of order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1424.462s">This</a> is their floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1425.002s">Point</a> of order, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1426.604s">Pursuant</a> to the council rules, a paper that's in subcommittee cannot hit the council floor until a committee of the whole has met.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1434.332s">And</a> the committee of the whole has not met.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1462.609s">It's</a> a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1464.21s">If</a> it doesn't even get out of the committee of the whole, it doesn't become operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1466.63s">It</a> doesn't even hit the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1467.53s">It</a> doesn't become operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1469.011s">It's</a> often not. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1469.871s">All</a> it is is a proposal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1508.2s">You</a> have to send them- That's not true, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1510.321s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1510.781s">That's</a> not true.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1623.21s">And</a> it was also, it was attached to the meeting notes, but it was also attached to a previous council agenda when the subcommittee reported the matter out favorably and requested a committee of the whole, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1630.996s">And</a> it's been attached to the council agenda, the council agenda once, maybe twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1635.98s">And</a> it's been attached to the meeting notice now as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1638.021s">So</a> I believe it is electronically available online. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1641.995s">Where?</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1795.303s">Tonight</a> if you want to clarify that I do believe the meeting is a public meeting open to the public tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1801.469s">It</a> is anybody that has a concern is more than welcome to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1804.191s">They'll</a> have an opportunity to be heard at that meeting Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1807.098s">Like</a> I said, I don't think it's very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1809.779s">When</a> the paper was first reported out, I believe I explained to the council is because it is a lengthy document. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1814.001s">If</a> you look at it and you'll see article 1.1, the swearing in and the oath of office, and then there's a number right next to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1820.003s">That</a> reflects the rule that's in the current rules that are adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1824.225s">And</a> I made that point soundly clear when the paper was reported out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1828.827s">Now,</a> the paper was reported out of committee some four, five, six weeks ago on this council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1835.089s">Nobody's</a> looked at it since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1836.13s">That's</a> not my problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1837.407s">I'm</a> sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1838.388s">If</a> they haven't looked at it, Mr. President, but this committee met for three and a half years on this topic, and we're ready to move forward on the matter and to present it to the council as presented to the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1849.615s">In</a> the interim, in the interim, I'd be happy to work towards putting a document like that together, but I don't feel as though it's something that should hold up the progress of the committee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1977.007s">And</a> the public participation period seems to be limited just to whatever's on the council's agenda for that week, which... If you look at it, there's also an open forum section, and an open forum section was established by way of the subcommittee to allow for residents of the general public to come up and speak before the council on items that do not appear on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=1998.93s">and</a> anyone wishing to do so may do so by application in accord with rule 4.0, which is the way that everybody currently applies to speak before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2006.515s">And</a> if you read the sentence further, it would say, or with the city messenger on the evening of the meeting prior to that portion of the meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2058.507s">Subject</a> to the will of the council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2137.526s">In</a> response to that, Mr. President, the parliamentarian for the council is the president of the council at that period, at that point of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2144.171s">He's</a> in charge of enforcing and implementing and applying the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2148.014s">Presently,</a> under the current rules that are in place right now, I believe they say that a citizen would be allowed to talk no more than three times for no more than 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2156.1s">So</a> this allows a person to speak still three times, <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2159.48s">for</a> up to three minutes, which actually increases participation, because it gives you a full 30 minutes to speak, as opposed to three times in 10 minutes, it gives you 30 minutes to speak.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2169.302s">10</a> minutes on any item that's on the agenda and 20 minutes on any items that aren't.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2179.705s">Whether</a> or not the rules are adhered to, the current rules are adhered to in the 310 rules and story, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/tUX_rthPMVU&t=2187.567s">Councilor</a> Marks.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1715.908s">Mr.</a> President, point of information would be if in fact, we're looking for the exact verbiage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1719.51s">Um,</a> I know that the council is in the past, always accepted written testimony as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1723.685s">Um,</a> we can accept the written testimony and save Mr. Silver the trouble of reiterating it three or four times and going through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1728.949s">And,</a> uh, you can submit the written testimony to the city clerk to be forwarded to the traffic commission if that's a suitable to the council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1921.776s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1922.737s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1924.158s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1924.738s">Councilor</a> Marks for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1927.52s">Uh,</a> I've been a firm advocate for examining citywide permit parking since my election some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1935.006s">Um,</a> and I think that that's really the best approach would be to taking, taking a look at this in a citywide perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1940.31s">Mr.</a> President, um, the piecemeal approach isn't working as we're going street by street by petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1945.228s">All</a> it is is pushing the problem over to the next block. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1948.251s">I</a> think the only fair and equitable way to really address this would be to take a look at the whole entire city, because the problems that the individuals are having in South Medford aren't much different than the problems that the individuals in the hillside are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1958.339s">And</a> they're not much different than the problems that the individuals down on First, Second, Third, and Fourth Street are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1964.364s">So</a> I think that the only fair and equitable approach, Mr. President, would be to examine it in a citywide basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1970.309s">That's</a> the position that I've had for a number of years, and that's the position that I'm going to maintain, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1975.223s">I</a> certainly also would support a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1977.546s">And</a> I think that as we look at the best practices of municipal government, best practices would show that data-driven decision-making is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1985.174s">And</a> you can't make data-driven decision-making without collecting data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1988.998s">And</a> the way to collect the data would be through a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1991.2s">So</a> I can certainly sympathize with the issues that are going on down in South Medford, because I quite frequently spend a lot of time there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1996.473s">And</a> I, too, have issues with parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=1998.594s">And</a> as I think about it right now, I have a $100 ticket that I have to pay for being a little too close to a bus stop down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2005.778s">So</a> I, too, have been victimized and victimized myself, I guess, by trying to do the best I can to squeeze in down in that neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2014.042s">So</a> I certainly understand the frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2015.523s">And</a> ultimately, it is a quality-of-life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2017.524s">And</a> I think that this is something that can be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2020.365s">I</a> think that it's also taken too long for the Traffic Commission to make a determination as to whether or not citywide permit parking is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2026.86s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think that looking at this in the only fair and equitable way would be to do it on a citywide basis.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2357.397s">Uh,</a> Mr. President, I'd also like to further amend the paper and request that the DCI provide us with a listing of all of the DCI controlled crosswalks and, um, cross signals in the community so that we can take a look and make sure that we're all operational and, uh, meeting their intended purpose on that motion as amended again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2452.051s">Motion</a> to take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2756.776s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2759.017s">I</a> think it's safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2760.672s">We</a> here in the community ask a lot of our educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2763.654s">But</a> asking them to be crossing guards is a bit much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2766.136s">I'd</a> like to publicly commend Principal Suzanne Buckley-Galusi on her efforts and her work in taking this situation as seriously as it is and getting out there and actually taking action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2776.563s">So</a> I think she was a great hire and a great selection for principal of the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2781.126s">And</a> she's really living up to expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2782.827s">And</a> this is evident, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2784.708s">But</a> with that being said, we have a representative here from the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2788.432s">Mr.</a> Barry Clemente here, and maybe he can shed some light on the situation as to what happened and explain to us exactly what was going on on Monday morning and how we got to that situation and what steps have been taken to prevent it from happening again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=2801.179s">Now</a> before us live, the man behind the phone calls, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3022.695s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3023.575s">Uh,</a> captain appreciate the work you do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3233.405s">Yes,</a> Captain, when you say reserve officer, are you referring to a reserve officer on the reserve list that could be eligible for hire if in fact a position became available?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3257.224s">Do</a> you have an auxiliary as well?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3265.023s">Okay,</a> so there's no auxiliary, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3618.138s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3619.159s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3619.639s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3620.099s">Um,</a> I had a recent conversation with, um, personnel in the DPW that did inform me that some signage is in stock or has arrived relative to pedestrian crossings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3630.966s">I</a> don't know if it's the rectangular rapid flashing beacon, but I know that they have some stock that has arrived and I can clarify that for Mr. O'Leary as to whether or not, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3642.624s">that</a> is the material that has come in, uh, that's in stock and ready to go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3647.007s">But</a> ultimately I'd like to amend the paper and, um, include Councilor Marksley's recommendation that our traffic super and supervisors be outfitted with communication equipment that will allow them to dispatch either the main office of the school that they're working at or to the Metro police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3661.175s">Um,</a> I think that, like I, as I said, we ask a lot of our educators, Mr. President, but they're always willing to rise to the top and rise to the occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3668.08s">And</a> if they're being, <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3669.385s">dispatched</a> by the crossing got into the main office that there's a problem out there than the main office has some personnel that can handle some of the phone calls and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3677.408s">Well,</a> the crossing traffic supervisor continues to cross kids and make sure that they get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3681.69s">So</a> I think that's an excellent recommendation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3683.651s">I</a> think it should be added to part of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=3685.552s">I</a> thank you for bringing it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4507.672s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4508.753s">I</a> certainly appreciate the resolution as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4510.855s">I</a> think it's a good idea to increase the police presence in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4515.042s">We're</a> in a catch-22. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4515.923s">We</a> want to create a vibrant square with places for people to congregate and for people to relax and for people to reflect like at the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4522.128s">But</a> at the same time, we want to be sure that we're policing the individuals that are there so that we're providing a strong quality life and a nice environment for those to utilize and enjoy these spaces, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4533.257s">So</a> I'm wholeheartedly in support of this resolution and I, too, move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4566.825s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4567.505s">This</a> has been a lingering issue for a couple of years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4571.207s">There's</a> been some complaints from residents on Terrace Road that there is a ongoing humming or buzzing sound that is coming potentially from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4579.17s">There's</a> been some investigation into the matter and meetings with the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4582.812s">And</a> I'm just asking for an update as to where we are in that process, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4606.559s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4607.32s">With</a> Veterans Day fast approaching, I've received a number of calls of some individuals who have applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4611.944s">to</a> have their name added to Honor Roll Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4614.347s">As</a> we all know, Honor Roll Park is the monument on Winthrop Street at the foot of Steve Miller Way leading up to the high school that would honor those combat veterans that have served in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4624.036s">And</a> it's been brought to my attention that the list is expanding and growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4627.68s">I</a> think we have potentially enough applicants right now, Mr. President, where we could <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4633.192s">move</a> to add the names to one row park and it would be cost effective and I just would like this information so that I can cross-reference that and see how much it will cost and then maybe make a recommendation to the mayor to appropriate funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=4644.737s">Veterans</a> Day is fast approaching on November 11th and I think if we get this information before then maybe by Memorial Day we'll be able to have some money appropriated and get the names added to the list.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5018.977s">Um,</a> pursuant to our rules, Mr. President, a similar matter was disposed of last week and, uh, the paper should not have reached the table for 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5027.2s">Um,</a> if we're going to be looking at the rules and Robert's rules of order, I think it's also important to point out that the rules of the Medford city council would indicate that that paper was disposed of and then, uh, substantial and like matters cannot be brought to the table for 90 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5050.269s">Paper</a> 16667 from the table for third reading.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5067.158s">Mr.</a> President, this was a piece of legislation that I put forward to increase the legal age to purchase tobacco in the city of Medford from 18 to 21 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5075.602s">It</a> was recommended by way of our tobacco prevention grant coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5079.928s">uh,</a> supported by the administration verbally. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5082.088s">I'm</a> in discussions with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5084.009s">Uh,</a> it was also passed unanimously here at the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5086.629s">Um,</a> at its first reading, it was advertised duly in the Medford transcript on October 6th, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5091.37s">It</a> is eligible for third reading today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5093.711s">Mr.</a> President, I would ask that this matter be approved this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Oj3ns4r1Qn4&t=5096.572s">Um,</a> by doing so, we'll be addressing a public health concern.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=2021.649s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4078.193s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this resolution up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4081.994s">I</a> grew up on a stretch of road between the Winthrop Street Rotary and the Brooks School, and I wasn't allowed to cross the street until I was 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4088.616s">So,</a> you know, I can tell you right now that it was certainly quite a speedy thoroughfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4094.297s">But</a> Councilor Falco brings up a good point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4096.418s">This</a> is a roadway that's state-controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4098.158s">There's</a> dual jurisdiction, and where there's dual jurisdiction in terms of the operations of the roadway, I think there should also be a commitment from our state police <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4106.563s">um,</a> for a dual jurisdiction and the enforcement of our traffic control laws that are in place here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4111.886s">Um,</a> so I'm in full support of Councilor, uh, Falco's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4115.808s">I</a> think it's very important to note, Mr. President, that, um, we have a detour right now that is directing traffic down route 16 and up onto high street right now with the closure of the credit bridge and that's creating traffic and that traffic is causing vehicles that are trying to get through the Winthrop street rotary to get through West Medford square and pass that stretch as fast as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4135.308s">Um,</a> so I think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4136.789s">I'd</a> ask, um, Councilor Falco if he doesn't mind that I amend it to request that the state police also, uh, kick up their police presence in the area to enforce, um, the speed limit, especially during the hours before and after school.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4400.992s">Um,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4402.912s">Um,</a> I'd like to amend the resolution and request that, um, the traffic commission look at the location of the crosswalk and whether, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4408.749s">or</a> not the crosswalk at the Brooks School would be best located on the corner of Alston and High and the corner of Auburn and High, or if it would be better off if they moved it off the intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4421.083s">and</a> almost like into the 50 odd line. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4422.664s">So</a> it would line up right with the front doors of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4424.706s">Mr.</a> President, that way vehicles that are turning left or right off of those side streets have a longer sight line so that they can see if there are people that are in the crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4433.672s">And</a> it would also provide, um, the queuing up of cars to those corners so that pulling out and into onto high street would be a little bit more difficult because it would be much more congested.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4778.703s">Um,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4780.204s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4780.644s">Councilor</a> Falco for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4782.726s">Uh,</a> I look out my window every day and see that rotary and, uh, some days are worse than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4787.449s">Sometimes</a> the days are worse than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4789.39s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4791.586s">There'll</a> be certain periods of time when there's no traffic at the rotary, but during the rush hour times, it is absolutely brutal. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4797.469s">And</a> I think councilor Caraviello hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4799.43s">It</a> has a lot to do with the lights that are timing, the timing of the lights down at route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4802.751s">Uh,</a> it has a lot to do with the backups at route 16 queuing up, but also has a lot to do with the backups on Boston Ave and Winthrop street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4808.974s">Um,</a> so I certainly can appreciate councilor Falco's resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4812.816s">Um,</a> however, I don't want to see us limit our options. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4817.742s">If</a> we're gonna study the intersection, let's study the intersection and let's see what works best. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4820.824s">Maybe</a> a bigger rotary works best. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4822.746s">Maybe</a> changing traffic patterns through right-hand and left-hand lane, only turn lanes works best. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4830.09s">But</a> I am reluctant to support a measure that's just going to say, take out the rotary and put in a set of traffic lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4835.894s">And</a> I think that that's what the language says, but in Councilor Falco's presentation, what he'd like to see, and correct me if I'm wrong, Councilor, is someone to take a look at this intersection and make recommendations into the design thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4845.497s">and</a> see what we can do to put some traffic calming measures in there to slow cars down, but to also prevent queuing and backing up through the intersection during these rush hour periods of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4856.861s">Yeah,</a> so I'd be very supportive of the resolution, Mr. President, if we didn't limit our options into creating a regular intersection with lights, but rather exploring and examining all options that are before the council and before the engineer, I think would probably make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4871.527s">And</a> that's something I could support if the gentleman would be willing to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4874.812s">I</a> think he will.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=4972.032s">Mr.</a> President, can we get them to pay for it?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5778.205s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5779.766s">And</a> if you look at Mary Ann and Tom, you'd never believe they've been married 50 years because they look like they're about 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5785.128s">Mr.</a> President, they've had a wonderful and very happy marriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5788.389s">And</a> they've been good friends to me for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5791.21s">Growing</a> up, running around Placedead Park, the Howells and the Caratis were very welcoming to the kids in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5797.472s">They</a> opened their backyards and their home to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5799.907s">was</a> fortunate enough to develop a great relationship with Thomas and Marianne Howell over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5805.73s">On</a> a side note, one of the first jobs I had as a young kid was working for the Howells at Chisholm's Motel on Route 1 in Saugus, where they used to manage and administer the day-to-day operations there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5817.334s">So</a> it's with great happiness for the Howells and for the Karate family that I stand here this evening and congratulate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5823.697s">I</a> hope that my council colleagues join me <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5825.996s">Mr.</a> President, I know Councilor Marks goes way back with the family as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5829.698s">So,</a> you know, with that being said, I turn the floor over to Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=5832.7s">Mr.</a> President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6072.409s">Mr.</a> President, this was a matter that was discussed and tabled previously following the public hearing on September 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6078.514s">I'm</a> here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6079.294s">We</a> do have Sean vegan representing the, <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6082.047s">property</a> owner, and the applicant that's here for a special permit before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6087.15s">I</a> spoke with Attorney Began earlier in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6090.992s">Mr.</a> President, pursuant to state statute and our zoning ordinances here in the city of Medford, we have 90 days from the closing of our public hearing to make a final determination as to whether or not we are going to approve or deny the keynote to go monitor license. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6106.81s">Whereas</a> the city solicitor is on a scheduled vacation until the end of next week, Mr. President, I'd ask that this matter remain on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6114.031s">However,</a> I did want to have Attorney Biegun have the opportunity to come up here and present the case for his client, and also have this written to the record that we will be willing to take this matter up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xPBP-EonBGI&t=6122.273s">It's</a> just going to take some time for us to get back with the city solicitor and get his opinion on a couple of issues that have been raised.<h2><a href="../2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY/2025-03-18_2SyhnAlrcqY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 4, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3359.647s">Mr.</a> President, I think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3361.229s">I</a> just think it's something that needs to be examined a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3364.591s">I</a> certainly have no problem increasing the number of liquor licenses here in the community and approving a homeowner petition to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3370.115s">However,</a> I'd like to take a little harder look maybe in the licensing subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3374.119s">We're</a> increasing it by 15 licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3376.14s">That's</a> quite a significant number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3379.102s">It's</a> almost 100% increase, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3381.284s">So</a> I think it's certainly something that needs a little bit further investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3384.907s">I'd</a> also like to have somebody from maybe the Department of Economic Development there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3389.013s">our</a> community development data discussed with us a little bit about the impact that these licenses will have on their ability to attract businesses to our downtown vacant storefronts.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3415.385s">Motion</a> to revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4684.788s">And,</a> um, and looking at this, I mean, I think it looks like we have either five or six, um, students in each grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4692.209s">Um,</a> we can invite them to separate meetings and have them sit in with us as well as receive their, uh, council commendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4696.93s">If</a> the council is willing to approve this resolution, Mr. President, I think that would be very educational for these individuals who are going to be the future leaders here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4704.095s">in</a> our community and who are the current leaders here in the Medford public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4708.697s">It's</a> not easy putting your name on the ballot and putting yourself out there to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4711.919s">And</a> these individuals have done it at a very young age and I commend them and congratulate them on their hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4717.301s">These</a> were the individuals that were successful in their elections and I'm sure there were others that weren't successful, but to put your name out there and to give it a run and to give of yourself and to be willing to provide a public service is something that should be commended, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4731.419s">I</a> think they're going to be responsible also for planning the future high school reunions for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4738.1s">And</a> I think my 20th is coming up in a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4740.801s">So</a> as I look at this list and see these names on it, the grade 12 President Anthony McKillop is going to be a name that Medford High alumni in the class of 2017 hear from for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4752.383s">He's</a> going to have quite a responsibility at coordinating and organizing these reunions as he graduates and the years go on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4760.265s">But</a> I move for approval.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1081.29s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1082.63s">And</a> thank you to my colleagues for your input on this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1090.892s">Having</a> grown up in the area and attended the Brooks School and having been involved <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1094.988s">near</a> accidents myself as a child in that intersection, I certainly understand the situation that's at hand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1102.453s">One</a> of the things that I was thinking, listening to Councilor Caraviello in his presentation would be, we do have a dock pickup area on Auburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1110.599s">If</a> this ordinance gets passed this evening, there's no guarantee that those lights are gonna be changed tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1115.262s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1131.136s">Do</a> I sound like Sinatra? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1134.518s">So,</a> as I was saying, Mr. President, I think Councilor Caraviello brings up some several good points, as does Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1140.642s">One</a> thing that concerns me is that these events have been occurring quite frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1145.785s">They've</a> been occurring for a number of years, and I believe there should be some reporting requirement that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1150.488s">at</a> the school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1151.909s">So</a> I'm wondering if we can amend the resolution to request that the principal of the Brooks School, Suzanne Galusi, provide us with any suggestions or input that she may have in what she feels as though would make her job a little easier and make the students there safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1164.819s">She's</a> there every day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1166.2s">She</a> also went to the Brooks School and grew up in the neighborhood, so I think she has a pretty good grasp and handle on the issues at hand, and I think that she'd be able to provide us with some very helpful information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1175.748s">And</a> one of the other items I'd like her to look into, if possible, would be to move the pickup area to the rear end on Prescott Street, where there's a large lot that people can pull in and out of, where students can congregate free and absent of being right next to the main roadway, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1189.456s">So</a> those are the two items that I'd like to add to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=1191.898s">I</a> appreciate the Councilor for bringing it forward and it's something that I support.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3206.61s">The</a> Treasurer-Collector or the Assessor, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3208.552s">The</a> Assessor's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3210.194s">I</a> think you might be able to petition the Assessor's Office for an abatement on the additional $132 in excise. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3216.141s">I</a> think that if you petition the <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3219.953s">board</a> of assessors with requests for an abatement as well as a sworn affidavit saying that your location was Florida and that you disposed of the vehicle prior to you leaving the state, that that would be enough to get your foot in the door and you can make a case with the board of assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3232.444s">That</a> would be my advice.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3286.507s">My</a> advice would be to give Mr. O'Neill a call back, as the chairman of the Board of Assessors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3290.25s">He'll</a> be able to point you in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3291.631s">If,</a> in fact, they'll be willing to entertain an appeal for an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3295.33s">We'll</a> have to go back to the drawing board, but I think that's a good place to start.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3535.759s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much and thank you to the petitioner as well as the gentleman who came up to speak in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3542.124s">After</a> a view of the papers, all the paperwork does appear to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3544.706s">Mr.</a> President, as we've noted that this is an issue that requires a special permit, I personally feel as though we don't have a need for any kino monitors in our convenience stores and I'd like to be recorded in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3557.717s">However,</a> the paperwork is complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3559.878s">I</a> see no problem with the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3561.76s">This</a> is a philosophical <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3563.935s">issue</a> for me, Mr. President, not a matter of public process or procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3568.198s">So,</a> with that being said, I'd move for approval on the papers, but I'd like to be reported in opposition because I feel as though we have enough keynote monitors in our convenience stores as it is right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3686.107s">Does</a> the gentleman have the ability to sell Kino right now, absent the monitor?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3691.009s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3735.02s">If</a> I may, Mr. President, it's a special permit issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3737.46s">Whatever</a> permits were granted before I came on the council that I have no control or knowledge of, however, since I've been on this board, I've consistently voted against Keno monitors and convenience stores because I feel like it takes the convenience out of convenience stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3750.003s">You</a> go there for milk, you got to wait in line for people to play Keno, people are standing around loitering. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3753.583s">It</a> just gives a bad feel for the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3755.944s">It's</a> a philosophical thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3756.944s">It's</a> nothing to do with the individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3758.224s">I</a> think that they run a great business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3759.464s">I'm</a> very familiar with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3760.665s">I</a> was very familiar with Dan's convenience before they took over.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3798.76s">I</a> know that the application, Mr. President, indicated that that layout was still required by, I believe, our building department to take a look at before. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3806.782s">Yes,</a> we need a plot plan for the special permit through the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3811.546s">City</a> clerk's application from the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3813.448s">So</a> that plug plan does need to be submitted to the building commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3816.032s">We</a> have submitted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3817.093s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=3817.874s">Everything</a> has been submitted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4521.524s">Obviously.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4524.166s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4524.946s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4526.267s">And</a> Mr. Moki, thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4527.947s">I</a> think it was a rather thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4530.398s">It's</a> my recollection that this council has appropriated funds in the past to make sure that the roof was weathertight to get it through the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4537.244s">I</a> think we did that last winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4538.424s">I</a> think we might've done it the winter before as well, if I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4542.347s">We've</a> appropriated some funds so that we maintain that the roof is in safe water until we could get a paper like this before us so that we could go and get to work, if I recall correctly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4578.447s">And</a> with the approval of this paper, you feel as though you'll be able to get the construction work started out there in the next, looks like, what, 30 days' time almost.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4617.1s">And</a> soup to nuts, Mr. Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4619.702s">We're</a> looking at this project starting and how long do you think phase one will take to complete.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4647.907s">We're</a> at the close of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4649.007s">Okay,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4649.908s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4650.388s">I</a> appreciate your time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=4870.412s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5491.63s">So</a> at this point in time, Mr. Mulkey, it would be the recommendation of the administration that we move forward to repair the roof and take further look at the seismic requirements in the state building code that might allow us to expand the building, as I understand it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5517.947s">So</a> there's a possibility that we could expend $35,000 to $45,000 this evening for repair work to the roof that ultimately will need to be replaced in the future if the addition doesn't go as... <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=5530.585s">discussed</a> or planned?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6218.462s">Mr.</a> President, I'll reserve my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6220.163s">I</a> think we're all understanding where we are right now and how we're going to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6223.286s">So</a> with that point in time, I'd second Councilor Caraviello's move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6966.736s">Mr.</a> President, I was going to say a motion to refer the matter to the Traffic Commission for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6970.016s">I'm</a> in support of it wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=6971.556s">I</a> think it's a great resolution and I thank Councilor Caraviello for putting it on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7846.189s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7847.569s">I</a> certainly can appreciate the ordinance, and I think that back last session, Councilor Marks came up with actually <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7855.049s">an</a> excellent idea on a way to combat graffiti in private residences by creating a revolving graffiti removal account and having a graffiti removal team that will go out and speak with property owners who have been affected by graffiti and then, with their permission and waiver liability, be allowed to go onto the private property and remove that graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7874.04s">I</a> think that this is a great opportunity for us to explore further what options and opportunities we have to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7881.984s">I</a> think that, you know, one of the things <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7884.016s">that</a> Councilor Marks put together was an actual team that will go out and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7887.679s">And</a> when we look at our DPW and some of the areas that we can improve on, I think that we might want to look at creating a permanent sign department that's responsible for the erecting of signs and the removal of graffiti in public and private places. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7901.088s">I</a> think that this would be a great, great place to start for us to have the discussion and to jump off on speaking on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7906.592s">You</a> know, Councilor Falco sits on the zoning and ordinance subcommittee with myself and Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7911.536s">And</a> you know, I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7913.875s">We</a> have a work product that shows that we've been able to get things done when we met and worked together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7917.616s">So,</a> um, with that being said, I wholeheartedly support the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7920.597s">I</a> look forward to sitting down with my colleagues on the zoning subcommittee and addressing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=7924.238s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8595.683s">Mr.</a> President, in our packets this evening, we have a letter dated September 20th, 2016 to the President and members of the Medford City Council from Stephanie M. Burke-Meyer regarding Resolution 16-662, Update on Enhancements to Communications and Relations with Business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8611.192s">Dear</a> Mr. President and Councilors, in response to Resolution 1662, I would like to update the Council on the actions that have been taken to improve relations and communications between the new and existing Medford businesses and City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8624.101s">In</a> January of 2016, I created the position of Business and Cultural Liaison to ensure that a dedicated staff member in the Mayor's Office is always equipped and available to work directly with businesses on any and all issues brought to our attention, as well as to spearhead important initiatives that will strengthen our relationship <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8639.618s">with</a> and promote economic development within our business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8644.282s">The</a> first priority of this position, currently held by Ali Fisk, was to immediately open a line of communication between the city and the business associations in Medford, including the Medford Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8654.53s">By</a> attending numerous Chamber of Commerce government affairs meetings, as well as important membership meetings, Ali has gathered vital feedback from the businesses in an effort to elevate and evaluate business needs and ascertain ways that the city of Medford can better serve the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8668.62s">This</a> month, my office will be releasing the Medford Business Guide, an online and print booklet designed to guide individuals through the process of opening a new business in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8677.444s">Depending</a> on the type of business, this guide directs individuals to appropriate departments at City Hall, describes permitting processes, and provides individuals with links to online applications and other web resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8687.608s">In</a> February and March of 2016, the Business Economic Development Transition Team conducted community meetings in Medford's five key business districts, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8697.837s">and</a> engaged over 250 participants who contributed ideas about desired changes, upgrades, and initiatives in these regions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8704.798s">The</a> report, entitled Shaping Medford Community Conversations to Guide Our Economic Future, breaks down suggested improvements by individual business square and makes suggestions for ways the city of Medford can support economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8717.061s">In</a> September and October, I'll return to these squares with members of the transition team to meet with businesses and constituents and underscore some of the important findings and suggestions specific to individual business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8726.954s">This</a> will be an opportunity to further engage in a deeper dialogue with the businesses and stakeholders in the region about other important initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8734.756s">In</a> an effort to improve customer service at City Hall for both businesses as well as for residents, all City Hall employees have attended a mandatory customer service training, which engaged employees in important dialogue and guidance regarding best practices in customer service. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8747.578s">We're</a> in the process of contracting for a new phone system, which will be implemented in four to six weeks, and it will include voicemail, an efficient intercom system, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8755.358s">and</a> will allow City Hall to streamline its communications and better respond to important inquiries. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8761.383s">This</a> fall, we will be relaunching the senior work off abatement program, which will match the skills of seniors living in Medford with the needs of departments in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8768.489s">These</a> individuals will provide essential support to the departments and improve the staff's ability to provide adequate customer service in a timely manner as required. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8776.056s">One</a> of the many job positions will be a greeter at City Hall to assist all who enter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8780.761s">maintaining</a> a strong and testing relationship with the business community is of the utmost importance to my administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8785.605s">Well,</a> this letter outlines the important strides that have been taken to build these relationships over the next few months. <a

customer service systems that are in place here in city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=8799.695s">Sincerely,</a> mayor Stephanie and Burke.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10243.031s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10245.131s">I</a> certainly think that we've all had discussions here behind this rail about development in the city of Medford, what direction the city of Medford's going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10253.895s">what</a> we'd like to see happen in our community, whether or not we want to remain a bedroom community, whether or not we want to be a hybrid bedroom community and a place with vibrant downtowns, or whether we want to be a full-blown extension of Somerville, really, is what it's coming into, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10270.407s">So</a> with that being said, I think that there are a number of questions that need to be answered, and I think that this would be a perfect measure to further examine and discuss at the subcommittee level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10279.544s">I'd</a> like to hear from the Office of Economic Development to see what concerns they have about issuing a moratorium on building development would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10287.228s">I'd</a> like to hear from the Community Assistance Unit from the Department of Housing and Community Development at the state level to see if they can provide us with technical assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10294.492s">And</a> we've already been working hand-in-hand with the MAPC in terms of our Safe Streets Program and some other matters that we're discussing, like the revitalization of Medford Square, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=10304.32s">So</a> I certainly feel as though further discussion is warranted on this topic, and I feel as though further discussion is warranted at the subcommittee level in the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee, and I'd like to amend the motion to refer them out of there.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11276.99s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11278.39s">I</a> appreciate you reading through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11280.391s">It</a> was rather long, but thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11283.051s">I</a> think this ordinance change speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11285.532s">The</a> intention of this ordinance change would be to raise the legal age to purchase tobacco products in the city of Medford from 18 to 21 years of age, unless that individual is 18 years of age and in possession of a valid military identification card, a member of our armed services, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11301.957s">130</a> of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts have adopted a measure raising the legal age to purchase tobacco from 18 to 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11310.019s">That's</a> the equivalent to about 37 percent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11316.26s">180</a> municipalities across the United States of America have adopted a measure raising the age to purchase tobacco products to 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11324.205s">Massachusetts</a> is obviously a leader with 130 of those communities laying here in our great state, but there are 50 other communities as of August 1st that have adopted this, including New York City, Kansas City, Cleveland, and even Boston, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11337.056s">Two</a> states in the union have also adopted a measure making it a statewide requirement that the legal age to purchase tobacco products would be raised from 18 to 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11345.482s">Those</a> two states are California and Hawaii, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11348.344s">One</a> of the largest states in our union, California, has taken this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11351.867s">It's</a> a public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11354.263s">In</a> 1986, in Philip Morris' annual report, Mr. President, you could read the report, and it would indicate that raising the legal minimum age for cigarette purchase to 21 could gut our key young adult market from age 17 to 20, where we sell about 25 billion cigarettes annually and enjoy a 70% market share. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11375.596s">Mr.</a> President, data will also say that 90% of all smokers started smoking before the age of 21, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11383.717s">released</a> in 2011. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11385.718s">And</a> 99 percent of all smokers started smoking before age 26, according to the Surgeon General report of 2012, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11394.163s">I'm</a> putting this measure forward as an ordinance change in the interest of public safety, and I'd ask my colleagues to support it here at the City Council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11419.059s">At</a> this point in time, Councilor Caraviello, I believe the vaping products have been addressed by way of a regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11423.902s">The</a> Board of Health issued a vaping product regulation, and I believe that that regulation speaks to the vaping products. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11429.085s">City</a> ordinance does not at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11437.851s">Also,</a> Mr. President, I'd like to add that <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11440.102s">of</a> the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 communities in the Mystic Valley area that is part of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11446.486s">Medford</a> is one of the remaining communities that has not adopted this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11449.768s">So</a> while surrounding communities have adopted this measure, we're actually the weak link in the chain at this point in time, where individuals in other communities that have a legal age of 21 can come to Medford and purchase the cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11460.335s">So</a> in an effort to work with our colleagues and our counterparts in the communities beside us, I think that this is a great initiative.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11506.421s">Mr.</a> President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11509.783s">In</a> terms of the military exemption that's included in the language here, that was something that I put in there based on feedback from individual constituents that I had spoken about that had served in the armed forces and that spoke a little bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11520.445s">you</a> know, how they started smoking at a young age in the military and how they felt as though if they were of the legal age to vote and fight that they should be old enough to make a decision to purchase cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11530.658s">Since</a> that time and since some of my discussions with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11533.121s">Busby</a> from the task force over in the city of Melrose who helps us here in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11537.182s">She's</a> provided me with a number of articles and a number of documents saying that the military actually is looking to curb tobacco use among military members. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11545.509s">They've</a> put out a number of reports saying that those soldiers that actually smoke on a daily basis, it's having an effect on their military readiness and it's also obviously, Mr. President, having an effect on their longevity in the community after their obligations to the service of enlistment are over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11565.602s">With</a> that being said, I have no problem with the language in there as it is, but if individuals have a problem with that particular portion of the language, I have no problem striking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11573.624s">I</a> think ultimately it's a public safety bill, and what we want to do here is be sure that the youth in the city of Medford aren't exposed to tobacco products at a young age so that we have a better opportunity of keeping them out of the nicotine habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11585.408s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I personally don't have any problem striking that language, and it's really a matter that I'd rely on my council colleagues to provide further input. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11595.804s">I</a> have had some preliminary conversations with the administration, and Mayor Burke said that that was an exemption that she was certainly opposed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11603.585s">She</a> feels as though it provides an enforcement issue, and she feels as though it's kind of counterintuitive to the actual context of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11612.607s">So,</a> you know, I have no problem striking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11615.228s">I</a> feel as though it might be an item that comes down to being vetoed anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11619.088s">So</a> at this point in time, Mr. President, I think it might be in our best interest to strike the military exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11623.442s">send</a> it over to the president to get passed, send it over to the administration to get passed if that's the wishes of the council, and then if we get some feedback from individuals that are over 18 years of age that are active and in the military, we can take another look at the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11634.69s">But</a> the intent and purpose is a public health ordinance, and I think that putting that exemption in there based upon the materials that were submitted to me from the task force would prove to be counterintuitive and counterproductive, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11696.581s">Mr.</a> President, I'd move to amend the paper by striking the following language. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11702.963s">Unless</a> said person is 18 years of age and in possession of a valid military identification card.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11786.711s">I</a> don't want to take credit where credit isn't due. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11789.834s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11790.014s">Busby</a> did all the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11791.535s">I</a> just read what she sent me in terms of the military exemption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11795.519s">I</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=11796.5s">Thank</a> you for your help.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12186.928s">I</a> guess my question would have been, Mr. President, but I think I have the answer to it, can the compliance checks be handled outside of the scope of the ordinance and by way of Board of Health regulation? <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12194.992s">And</a> they can because the other inspections are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12198.273s">But</a> move approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12314.625s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12316.466s">As</a> we're all aware, I think everybody across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is aware, Mr. McGlynn passed away recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12326.017s">The</a> guy was just an amazing public servant, an amazing father, an amazing brother, and an amazing man. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12333.418s">He's</a> going to be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12334.519s">Mr.</a> President, I was very grateful to have had the opportunity to develop a friendship with him over the years, and I'm going to miss him. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12341.1s">I</a> know that his family is going to miss him, and I offer my further condolences to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12346.901s">His</a> track record speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12348.321s">His</a> resume speaks for itself, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12350.041s">He</a> was a person who gave of himself to the community, to the state, and to the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12354.493s">and</a> I feel as though dedicating this year's legislative session to him is warranted, and I move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12699.166s">Um,</a> Mr. President, as we noted earlier in the meeting, uh, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances made up of myself along with Councilor Falco and Councilor carrot yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12710.274s">And,</a> um, we've met on a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12712.495s">Uh,</a> we've met at a number of meetings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12714.497s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12716.973s">512,</a> 523, 81912, to take a look at the proposed safe zoning, the zoning amendment for the safe access to medicinal marijuana, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12725.877s">And</a> we made a series of recommendations for this committee of the whole to further entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12731.199s">The</a> motion that came out of the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances was that the committee of the whole would further entertain this for further deliberation and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12738.84s">Um,</a> recommendations include, uh, vesting the special permit granting authority with the board of health, um, expanding the maximum allowable gross square footage of a facility to prevent lines from building outside, increasing the permitting fee and using the, uh, portion of the permitting fee for the programming and related materials to meet the mission of the substance abuse and outreach coordinator, um, requiring the filing of the floor plan with the city clerk, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12764.217s">We</a> examined the inclusion of C1 and C2 districts, Mr. President, but would recommend that we only allow it in industrially zoned areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12772.16s">We</a> looked at developing an overlay district versus a zoning amendment, and we figured that the zoning amendment was the way to go as opposed to establishing an overlay district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12780.984s">We</a> discussed limiting the number of licenses for sale here in the community with the recreational bill coming on the ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12790.251s">There</a> might be some issue with limiting the number of licenses issued for medicinal or other uses here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12797.453s">We</a> examined buffer zone provisions, residential buffer zone provisions from locating a facility near a residentially zoned district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12806.376s">We</a> discussed banning or regulating marijuana-infused products, regulating the potency in packaging versus an outright ban. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12814.919s">We</a> also discussed allowing the <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12818.138s">administration</a> as the contract negotiating authority here in the community to have the sole authority to sign a letter of non-opposition for a marijuana dispensary for medicinal purposes to come into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12831.624s">We</a> made a recommendation of limiting the hours and days of operation from Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12836.406s">to</a> 6 p.m., not often on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12840.68s">We</a> also recommend that we enable the Board of Health to be empowered to establish rules and regulations to implement the ordinance that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=12848.803s">And</a> most importantly, that we'd hold a public information and input session out in the community so that we could receive some feedback from the residents that reside in this community as to what their thoughts and feelings are based upon the proposal that was put before us and the recommended changes that the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinance has made and what recommendations the Committee as a whole will make thereafter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13634.625s">In</a> regard to the minutes underneath paper 16-624, there was an issue of payment of a legal claim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13641.993s">And</a> I requested that the record reflected that the city solicitor found no conflict of interest with me voting after I gave my disclosure on the measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L5Dn-1_BzKM&t=13648.94s">I</a> just wanted the record to reflect that clearly, Mr. President.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc/2025-03-21_L9vF4yM-fUc.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 28, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=727.501s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=728.162s">I'd</a> ask how this resolution differs from the actual standard that's in place currently.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=894.559s">Mr.</a> President, if the city solicitor has a moment to answer this question, the resolution says notice is sent to all people within a 300-foot radius. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=904.685s">It's</a> my understanding that presently with <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=907.358s">the</a> term of butter, it's property owner versus a renter or a person that would be living.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=915.201s">Because</a> it's from the assessor's database of taxpayers.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=954.381s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=955.562s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the paper to strike the word all people and replace with all property owners.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1238.537s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1240.718s">This</a> is an issue that I think we're all rather familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1242.839s">We've</a> all been experiencing the noise in one fashion or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1246.221s">I</a> honestly have <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1250.693s">made</a> several inquiries into this, and it's a very interesting situation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1255.276s">Up</a> until very recently, the flight patterns that were being used were based on the same technology that was used during World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1262.962s">I</a> spoke with a gentleman by the name of Stephen Bolognese. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1265.184s">He's</a> an attorney, and he's one of the premier aviation experts here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1270.075s">And</a> he explained to me that the way that planes used to fly was through a beacon system, and it was the same technology that was used in World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1277.54s">In</a> the late 1990s, the federal government adopted a push towards using GPS-monitored flying control systems, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1285.025s">And</a> the reason they did that is because about 80 percent of the airspace wasn't being utilized under the post-World War II process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1293.811s">So</a> I think that this is going to get worse before it gets better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1298.042s">But</a> the mayor has taken affirmative steps and steps that I'm very pleased with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1301.265s">She's</a> appointed attorney Leonard Gleona to the Massport Advisory Council to represent the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1306.949s">And</a> in my conversations with Mr. Gleona, he's already informed me that he's been to at least two meetings over there at Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1313.014s">And</a> he's also been in contact with our state delegation to ask for some assistance where they have some funding responsibilities with the Massachusetts Port Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1320.818s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly appreciate the work that Mr. Glaman has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1323.999s">I</a> think he's a great choice for the job and he's more than capable of helping the city of Medford address this issue and this concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=1329.821s">I</a> support the resolution that the councilor has put forward and I look forward to hearing Mr. Glaman's response.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2868.655s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2869.656s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to amend the paper before us in the second to last paragraph and the second to last sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2874.679s">We'd</a> like to strike the word superintendent of the office of inspectional services and replace that with the building inspector. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2882.858s">We</a> also have, uh, an amendment that I'd like to propose. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2885.2s">Mr.</a> President, uh, it would read section point, uh, section seven dash one, five, five violations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2890.804s">I'd</a> like to strike section seven dash one, five, five, and replace that with two six dash four or five. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2895.368s">Mr.</a> President, as amended by councilor night, Mr. President, this is an excellent measure that's brought forward by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2902.494s">Um,</a> this is a piece of legislation that mirrors that, uh, that was being discussed in the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2909.95s">that</a> came off the heels of a council resolution that was passed to establish what would be called a university accountability ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2917.36s">In</a> reading the language in this document here, <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2919.773s">It</a> mirrors the language of the City of Boston's University Accountability Ordinance as well as that of the City of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2926.516s">It</a> seems to have worked in those communities rather well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2929.858s">In</a> my review of the matter, you know, it's virtually identical to those two other pieces of legislations in neighboring communities with the exception of some housekeeping matters that would make it reflective for Medford as opposed to Boston or Somerville or any other community for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2946.902s">But</a> this is a measure that I wholeheartedly support, 110%, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=2950.184s">I'd</a> move for approval on it, and I'd ask that the body here support this measure and that the vote be taken by a call of the yeas and nays.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3172.67s">I</a> believe the paper is already lying in the zoning and ordinance subcommittee right now, and we did have one meeting on it previously, just in terms of procedural history of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3190.154s">I</a> file the resolution, I attach language. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3194.477s">The</a> same concerns that you raised that night, that you're raising tonight were raised that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3197.9s">The</a> matter was sent to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3199.401s">The</a> subcommittee met on two or three occasions at this point in time to take up this paper as well as other papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3204.304s">We</a> discussed the paper not in its full length or entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3207.807s">The</a> language that was submitted by the administration mirrored the exact language that I was looking at when I was putting it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3214.941s">as</a> the sponsor of the resolution and the proposed ordinance change. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3219.742s">So</a> I can understand where you're coming from, and I'm sure you can understand where I'm coming from, and I'm very happy to see the language be pretty much virtually the exact same language that I was proposing at the subcommittee level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3229.664s">However,</a> I feel as though this is a great measure, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3231.924s">I</a> don't want to stop you further. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3232.865s">I</a> just wanted to give you procedural history as to where we were and where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3236.785s">But</a> I put a measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3240.128s">voted</a> to put it into subcommittee to draft something. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3242.45s">Something</a> was drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3243.63s">The</a> vetting process was ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3245.592s">The</a> paper was never reported out of committee in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3248.714s">The</a> administration has put an identical paper forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3567.652s">My</a> concern is that it does keep moving forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3569.914s">I</a> think Councilor Lungo said it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3572.196s">It's</a> been eight years in the making. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3575.077s">We've</a> had no proposed legislation that's been before the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3578.298s">Now</a> we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3579.798s">I</a> took a shot at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3580.578s">I</a> put some proposed legislation together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3582.299s">I</a> sent it into our subcommittee for review and for vetting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3586.88s">I'd</a> be willing to withdraw my motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3601.104s">Let</a> me finish what I was going to say.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3608.75s">What</a> I'm saying is this, what I'm saying is I'd be happy to withdraw my motion, but whereas the zoning and ordinance subcommittee has already met on it, I think it would make sense that it would remain in that subcommittee.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3669.853s">I</a> have a motion for approval on the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3672.035s">I</a> have no problem withdrawing that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3673.856s">If</a> somebody else wants it to go forward, then they can make the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3676.238s">But</a> I made the motion right out of the gate because it was something that I feel passionate about that I think it's a piece of legislation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3685.485s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3686.445s">I</a> made the motion right when I spoke, and I spoke first. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3689.007s">So</a> I'm saying I made the motion right out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3690.408s">I'll</a> withdraw my motion and let everybody else say what they think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3692.59s">I</a> have no problem with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3878.55s">Which</a> paper are we taking off the table, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3880.751s">I</a> think maybe the budget might be a good one to take up off the table at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3931.421s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3932.902s">Before</a> we walked into our meeting this afternoon at 7 p.m., there was a Zoning Board of Appeals meeting going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3938.266s">And</a> one of the items in discussion was the development of a property on Golden Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3943.85s">The</a> Zoning Board of Appeals has purview on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3946.662s">However,</a> there were some individuals that resided on Golden Ave that did have some concerns about the increase in volume of heavy trucking up their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3954.186s">Golden</a> Ave is a notorious cut through street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3956.307s">I</a> think we've all seen people take a right-hand turn on Mystic Ave from Harvard and then their shop left at Enterprise Towing up Golden Ave and then they keep going all the way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3966.273s">And</a> I think for those who didn't know the shortcut, I just told them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3968.798s">how</a> to do it, but ultimately, Mr. President, the road's seeing a large amount of increase in traffic, especially in heavy trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3975.182s">Heavy</a> trucking is prohibited on the street, so I'm asking that the administration take the appropriate steps.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=3993.873s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, upon the grand opening of McNally Park, I put a resolution in requesting that a crosswalk be erected so that residents who would like to walk to the park would be able to cross safely because the nearest crosswalk is either at the foot of Forrest and Salem or at Governors Lawrence and Forrest, Mr. President, so this would make it closer to the park.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4433.422s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4434.362s">In</a> early 2015, this council appropriated about $1.4 million in what was called the Community Improvement Initiative, and included in that was some funds to make structurally sound a retaining wall that had collapsed on a private residence between Gaston and Morgan Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4450.65s">And</a> there was some discussion about whether or not the property would be leaned if this construction work took place, and there was some confirmation that the property would be <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4458.466s">I'd</a> ask the administration for an update, as I've gotten a number of inquiries from neighbours and residents about the property, concerned about the structure and about the safety thereof.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4611.747s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4612.487s">I'd</a> like to ask the Director of Finance to come up and give a brief overview of the budget and what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4618.952s">The</a> Mayor's budget statement might be sufficient.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4930.999s">So</a> now the budget's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4932.5s">Councilor</a> Knight, you still have the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4933.82s">Mr.</a> President, I think it might be nice if we extend the same opportunity to the superintendent to give us a brief rundown of his budget as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4979.903s">I'm</a> more or less Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4981.564s">I</a> figured it might be good to just give a brief breakdown of the highlights in the budget for those of us that are here for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4989.029s">I</a> certainly can appreciate the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=4990.67s">It's</a> quite a voluminous document.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5870.3s">I'd</a> like to echo your sentiments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5871.98s">I</a> think Mr. Belson and his team did a wonderful job putting this budget together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5875.941s">It's</a> a strong school department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5878.002s">I</a> feel as though they've done a great job meeting all state and federal mandates, maintaining small class sizes of 20 students or less, expanding vocational opportunities in engineering and robotics. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5888.363s">business,</a> technology, biotech, the environment, emergency response, ems, Mr. President, cooperative education opportunities have expanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5897.13s">We're</a> going to see a multimedia program up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5900.352s">We've</a> seen the opportunity to integrate medford high school students and medford vocational high school, vocational technical high school students in the same programming, which is something that wasn't in place before with that brick wall that was between the two schools that no one could climb over has been broken down, Mr. President, and we're seeing students that are exploring <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5918.71s">opportunities</a> that they didn't have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5921.591s">We</a> look at the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5922.232s">It</a> also funds a new reading and literacy program, a new mathematics program at the elementary level, expands after school programs, and it actually allows for the creation of new before school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5932.716s">We</a> have three full-time elementary aides that are going to be coming in at the Roberts, and we still maintain a whole student focus, which is something that I think is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5940.14s">Mr.</a> President, this, you know, budget in the school side makes a commitment to technology, and we've also seen school security improvements, increases in <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5947.8s">personnel</a> and equipment there, which is something that this council's certainly expressed concern over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5952.022s">So</a> I'd like to thank Superintendent Belson for his work and that of the school committee as well on this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=5956.805s">I</a> think it's a well-prepared document and I feel as though it's something I'm comfortable supporting today.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6144.225s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6147.387s">I</a> do believe we got our budget books before the school committee finished their deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6152.109s">And</a> we also had met prior to the completion of their deliberations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=6157.092s">Is</a> that not correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8020.376s">That</a> requires a two-third roll call vote to end all debate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8023.498s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8024.058s">Requires</a> a two-third roll call vote to end all debate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8029.63s">It</a> requires a two-thirds, yes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L9vF4yM-fUc&t=8273.314s">Councilor</a> Marks has some comments that he'd like to add relative to the budget deliberation.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=177.465s">On</a> the motion by Vice President Lagucurne, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=180.605s">Mr.</a> President, I too had a conversation with Mr. Ryan Haywood relative to this very same matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=185.249s">And</a> he and I sat down and he pointed out what sections of the metric code of ordinances he was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=189.953s">Whether</a> this is a matter that would be a change in our city ordinances, I'd recommend that the matter be referred to our zoning and ordinance subcommittee for a draft piece of paper that can be put together for the council to review.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=206.908s">We</a> can have the solicitor's input at that point as well, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=210.33s">He's</a> always more than willing to help out with that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=212.372s">But</a> it seemed very remedial, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=214.453s">It</a> was a matter of crossing out six months and replacing it with the appropriate figure that we deem is proper at this point in time as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=221.797s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=222.398s">So,</a> on that motion, Madam Vice President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=265.189s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=266.43s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=267.83s">I</a> think this is a pretty self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=270.851s">It</a> came out of our budget meetings two Saturdays ago when the city engineer explained to us that this is a process and a procedure and a policy in other communities, and it's been met with success, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=281.736s">I</a> think it'll allow us the opportunity to identify the trench work that's being done by what public utility, and then we'll be able to hold them accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=288.679s">If</a> neighbors have a concern or a question, they can go out and look at the trench identification number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=292.931s">The</a> trench identification plates are coded by color so that you know what type of utility it is, whether it's electricity or water, and it allows a little bit easier quality of life issues in public service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=304.119s">So</a> I think that this is a good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=305.84s">I</a> also believe that it can be done at little or no cost to the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=309.102s">So</a> I'd ask my colleagues to support it, and I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=311.884s">On</a> the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=416.14s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=417.06s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=419.221s">One</a> thing I noticed when I drive down the streets of our city is that we have some beautiful parks, some very large parks that take up quite a bit of acreage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=426.32s">But</a> quite frequently, we don't see anybody utilizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=428.981s">Quite</a> frequently, we don't see anybody there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=430.482s">And</a> I think that part of that has to do with the fact that we don't have diversified options for the residents of this community to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=436.085s">And</a> I think some of these items are low-cost items, like a horseshoe pit or a bocce court or a shuffleboard court, Mr. President, that may bring people to our parks to utilize our open recreational space. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=445.971s">I</a> think that it's important that we provide opportunities for the members of our community, children and adults alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=450.529s">to</a> utilize these public open spaces, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=454.033s">And</a> I also think it's important with the discussions that we have here going on with childhood obesity and addiction that we provide opportunities for our community to utilize the services and amenities that we have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=465.404s">I'd</a> ask my colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=467.006s">I'd</a> ask for it to be taken in a roll call vote, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=718.353s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=719.333s">I</a> certainly have no objection to the amendments that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=722.096s">I</a> think Councilor Marksley's amendment is a great idea and it made me think about something that he brought up several months ago relative to graffiti walls where in certain areas and communities they put up graffiti walls and they allow people to write graffiti on them to <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=736.972s">focus</a> their energies and efforts on that site as opposed to on other pieces of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=741.033s">And</a> I think that that's just a perfect example of how that could come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=744.193s">It</a> takes a village, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=745.413s">I</a> think the more heads that are at the table, the more minds that get together to see what offerings we can extend to our community to ensure that our parks are operating in the capacity is going to be helpful and it's going to improve our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=755.735s">So</a> I certainly have no problem with any of the amendments that were made, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=758.776s">I'd</a> move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=825.837s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=827.291s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I've gotten a number of calls and complaints, and I actually was walking down the Arlington Street area just a couple of days ago, and several residents in the area have requested that we see more visible enforcement of the posted speed limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=840.701s">I</a> don't think this is a problem that's exclusive to Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=843.483s">I</a> think this is something that's citywide, and I think we could all probably sit here and amend this paper over and over and over again to include all, I don't know, 100 plus miles of street here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=853.191s">However,</a> there is a need down there, Mr. President, and I've been contacted by individuals in the neighborhood that would like to see some increased visibility, and I am asking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=861.375s">So,</a> with that being said, I'd ask that the council move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1012.811s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1014.072s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1014.853s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1015.653s">If</a> anybody's familiar with the area, Lincoln Road would run from Lawrence Road <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1020.512s">up</a> to Pilgrim Road, and there is a trench that extends probably that whole length, as well as a trench that extends halfway down Crocker Road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1029.62s">And</a> they're doing some infrastructure repairs up there, which is all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1033.383s">However,</a> the work's been going on for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1036.466s">There's</a> dirt and debris and sand and dust all over the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1040.349s">And</a> in a period of time where the weather is finally getting nice, individuals in this neighborhood are having a difficult time opening their windows during the weekends, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1047.705s">Because</a> come Friday around 3 o'clock, the construction crews pack up in their trucks and they drive away, but they leave some pipes, and they leave some bobcats, and they leave some big piles of dirt on the side of the road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1059.379s">This</a> is a dense residential neighborhood with very small sidewalks, and it's really becoming a quality of life issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1066.537s">I'd</a> ask that the city administration take the appropriate steps to have the public utility contractor beautify the area while the construction work is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1074.222s">We</a> already know that we're going to ask them to leave it in the same pristine condition that it was in before they came here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1079.966s">But</a> I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1082.968s">Neighbors</a> are complaining the neighborhood looks atrocious with the amount of dust and dirt debris that's on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=1088.552s">Something</a> that needs to be done is the least that the contractor could do based upon the disruption that they're causing the residents in the neighborhood.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2145.486s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2146.687s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2146.827s">Baker,</a> thank you very much for your work on this budget and for preparing this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2151.11s">Are</a> there any other accounts other than those listed on this list that are in deficit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2161.034s">These</a> are all the accounts that have a deficit.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2174.041s">Are</a> there any other accounts that have a surplus in them other than these? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2176.422s">Oh,</a> sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2177.443s">Do</a> you know offhand what the figure is for that surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2179.644s">Less</a> than $1.1 million?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2185.42s">Yeah,</a> the total amount of a surplus account minus one, if you'd like us to translate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2212.513s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2366.909s">Mr.</a> President, this site is actually outside the jurisdiction of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2369.991s">However,</a> I believe it does lie on the Somerville and Ireland, I mean the Medford and Arlington line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=2374.314s">So</a> I'd ask that DCR be stricken from the resolution and we replace that with our state delegation, Representative Garvely and Senator Jalen.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3524.107s">I'm</a> confused about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3527.369s">So</a> is papal 16562 now being stopped and papal 16561 being started? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3532.052s">I'm</a> confused about what's going on here right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3537.014s">Is</a> that what?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3543.858s">Okay,</a> so you have your paper that's still, you want removed from the table then?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3821.892s">Yes,</a> Madam President, Mr. Reed, thank you very much for your well thought out comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3828.594s">However,</a> the fact of the matter is this, Madam President, the Medford City Council isn't the personnel department for Medford City Hall and the Medford City Council is not the procurement office for Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3838.776s">So</a> we don't have the ability, even if we wanted to, to hire an employee in the engineering office, nor would we have the ability to <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3844.962s">issue</a> an RFP for a contract that's required under the public bid laws in order to get a contract that'll work for the city, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3851.644s">So</a> as such, I can certainly appreciate where the gentleman's coming from, but it's really a matter that's outside council purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3856.326s">It's</a> really a matter that the council has no ability to effectuate any change on in terms of our vested powers, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3863.709s">So</a> as such, I'd move that the matter be received and placed on file.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3892.838s">Remark.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3893.418s">My</a> rule would be that the Medford city council is the legislative body of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=3898.101s">The</a> administration is the executive name and address for the record.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4540.949s">The</a> paper's a personnel issue, not a procurement issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4542.59s">I'm</a> not going to do anything as far as the matter before us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4549.173s">We're</a> going to be employed as a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=4550.574s">Anything</a> over $10,000 must be subject to public bid law.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5342.628s">I</a> believe the question that was asked to the superintendent was how many students are enrolled in Medford high school, fy15, fy16, fy14, fy15. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5348.969s">I</a> believe the superintendent said he doesn't have those figures offhand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5353.27s">However,</a> it's about flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5355.271s">4,600</a> is the estimate that I would give, I believe was the answer that he gave to that question, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5385.599s">I</a> do believe Councilor Scarpelli, at a subcommittee meeting, asked whether or not the City of Medford School Department was in all aspects of compliance with state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5392.342s">I</a> believe that the response that the superintendent of schools gave us was yes, the City of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5396.217s">school</a> department is in compliance with all aspects of state law, including reporting requirements.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5457.646s">Ultimately,</a> Mr. President, this paper started out as a matter related to Evans Street and the paving thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5463.448s">And</a> there was some talk that the Evans Street project wasn't going to get done, that it wasn't going to go out to bid, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5469.97s">So</a> when that information was brought to my attention, I picked up the telephone and I spoke with Mark Shea over in the engineering division. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5476.852s">And</a> I'd like to just briefly read an email that he sent back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5480.413s">My</a> question was, Mark, what's going on with Evans Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5482.433s">It's</a> my understanding that the project's not going to go forward and the bids have been rejected. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5486.002s">Mr.</a> Knight, I'm unaware of that news. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5487.703s">It's</a> my understanding that the contract review is complete and has been approved for award. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5491.624s">The</a> procurement office will be issuing an award letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5495.165s">When</a> received, the contractor needs to put together the required paperwork, bonds, insurance, construction schedules, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5501.047s">They</a> need to sign the paperwork and return the contract to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5503.568s">And</a> after these requirements are complete, the city will sign the contract, allowing the contractor to start the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5508.849s">This</a> project may take more than a couple of weeks, but once you receive the work schedule, we will pass this information along to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5514.068s">Also,</a> if you'd like to review the copies of the contractors' bid sheets, you can pick them up in the procurement office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5518.091s">They</a> are kept on file there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5519.171s">I</a> believe four contractors submitted a bid for the Water Works contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5523.474s">Signed,</a> Mark Shea, Assistant City Engineer, City Hall, Room 300, 85 George B. Esset Drive, Medford, Mass., Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5529.678s">So</a> it appears to me that the process of the reconstruction of the water infrastructure on Evans Street is still undergoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5536.863s">It's</a> also apparent to me, Mr. President, based on that correspondence from the engineering department, that there <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5542.499s">taking</a> the affirmative steps to make sure that this gets done in fast track. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5545.962s">So</a> with that being said, that was just for the record, Mr. President, so that we could get back to the item that was on topic and to provide the most up-to-date information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5552.907s">That</a> was an email from Mr. Shea at, oh, about 3.30 this afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5556.67s">Upon</a> receipt of that email, I picked up the telephone and I spoke with Brian Cairns, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5560.873s">And</a> Mr. Cairns also got back to me, and Mr. Cairns' exact words to me were, and I wrote them down because I wanted to be sure I wasn't misquoting him this evening, was, <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5574.44s">The</a> water main and service is then repaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5575.961s">That</a> is going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5576.841s">Procurement</a> will be issuing an award letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5578.482s">Then</a> the contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5579.662s">It's</a> all on schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5581.483s">So</a> it's apparent to me, Mr. President, that this matter is going to be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5584.884s">It</a> might not be in the schedule that we all would like to see it on, but it is on a schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5588.386s">And</a> it's my hope and my wish and my desire that this gets done before the close of this construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5594.128s">And</a> as such, I will continue to pick up the phone and continue to contact the individuals that are responsible for <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5599.183s">ensuring</a> that this project goes out to bid appropriately and the construction work starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5602.364s">But</a> I did want to be sure that I shared that with the neighborhood, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5696.666s">Mr.</a> President, I addressed the clarifications that I needed to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2MzH8zDWQL0&t=5699.528s">I</a> find the records in order and I move for approval.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g/2025-03-21_hFAk--zIv7g.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 14, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=443.478s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=444.259s">This</a> is a reappointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=445.179s">Mr.</a> Flynn has served as the chairperson of the Licensing Commission for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=449.301s">Recently,</a> we've seen a new member appointed that hasn't served on the Licensing Commission before that this council approved, one Dean Bruno. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=456.255s">I</a> believe that Mr. Flynn's experience in his background and working in this position would be an absolute asset to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=461.756s">And</a> I move for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=720.995s">Mr.</a> President, the last three years that I've been on the council, this group has come by and they've asked for the opportunity to turn the town teal. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=731.117s">And</a> one of the requests that I've continually made was that I'd like a little ribbon for my- We will have the ribbons. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=736.219s">For</a> my lamp here and for my colleagues on the council as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=740.439s">Excellent,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=741.24s">Mr.</a> President, move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10538.502s">I</a> certainly think that Councilor Caraviello is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10568.73s">Freddie,</a> give her the floor either one way or the other when we get to the end of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10791.779s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10793.24s">And,</a> um, I certainly feel as though, uh, Councilor Caraviello's recommendation and his motion, uh, to consult with an attorney to see whether or not we have a case is prudent course. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10802.107s">And,</a> um, I'll certainly be supporting that motion this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10805.67s">Um,</a> personally, I have a very different vision for the local street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10810.274s">Um,</a> I'm certainly not crazy about this large scale residential development and I'm really not <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10815.86s">overly</a> crazy about Wegmans coming in there either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10818.381s">I</a> think we have an opportunity to really take a look at putting in some mixed-use development at that location that's real, that has office space, that has commercial space, that has residential opportunities that are more in scale with the neighborhood, but that also will allow us an opportunity to really make a commitment to bringing affordable housing to our city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10838.472s">So,</a> with that being said, I don't think that this is a good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10841.093s">I</a> stated my reasons why last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10842.693s">You</a> know, traffic impact, impact on our public schools, impact on our infrastructure, and pretty much everything that everybody said here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10849.635s">I</a> mean, I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10850.915s">Councilor</a> Longo-Curran's right about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10852.715s">We</a> are all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10853.796s">We</a> feel as though this development is too large-scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10856.656s">We</a> feel as though this development's not going to have a great impact on the quality of life and the residents in the neighbourhood that are there and that are existing. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10865.279s">moving</a> forward and taking a look at whether or not we have a case, Mr. President, to determine whether or not we should appeal this is certainly the prudent course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10872.844s">So</a> with that being said, I will be supporting Councilor Caraviello's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10876.746s">You</a> know, I think that we can really make a commitment to putting mixed-use development down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10880.948s">I've</a> filed resolutions in the past to take a look at an overlay district or a mixed-use district down there with a commitment to affordable housing, and I'll continue to take a look at that stuff, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10891.095s">But</a> it can't get done without the help and the work and the cooperation from the developers that are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10895.495s">And</a> quite frankly, I feel as though these developers are coming into our city and they're trying to really maximize their potential to earn and not taking into consideration the factors that affect us and our quality of life and our everyday livelihood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10907.92s">So,</a> with that being said, I certainly oppose the project in its current state and I certainly support Councilor Caraviello's motion to consult with an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=10915.703s">And</a> I move for approval on that motion, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11292.794s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11295.247s">Our</a> actions are going to be contingent upon whether or not we can actually get in touch with somebody and get a list of people that are willing to actually review the case and take a look at the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11301.79s">Isn't</a> that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11327.607s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11327.787s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11328.167s">I</a> was a little confused by the direction that we were going.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11337.931s">Mr.</a> President, I'd even be willing to entertain an ad hoc committee being established to go through that process and present it to the council at some point in time with the decision-making processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11349.254s">But</a> that's at a later date, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11351.115s">Obviously,</a> we're going to get a list of lawyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11352.296s">We've</a> got to pick a lawyer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11764.363s">16-Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11765.323s">Take</a> a moment to withdraw paper 16548 and paper 16549 at this moment in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11770.187s">I'll</a> refile them when the time is proper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/hFAk--zIv7g&t=11814.478s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to table last week's records once again.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks/2025-03-21_a52ZUinVlks.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 7, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=212.435s">Mr.</a> President appears that everything's in order here. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=214.496s">I'd</a> move for approval of the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=382.253s">have</a> a determination as to whether or not they need a special license for extended hours at this point in time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=389.759s">I</a> don't feel so comfortable.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=405.658s">license</a> and allowed the gentleman to come back and petition for extended hours at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=410.28s">Provided.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=413.541s">If</a> you look at the petition, it says 24-7.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=416.962s">The</a> petition says 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=422.917s">So</a> my concern would be that we're approving it for 24 seven, but he may have a requirement to go through a special permit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=429.58s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=513.146s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=516.228s">Mr.</a> President, we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=517.428s">Can</a> we table item number 16533 until our budget discussions and budget hearings are complete?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=546.591s">Mr.</a> President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=749.977s">Mr.</a> President, I think this is a great resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=751.659s">It's</a> something that I'm going to be supporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=753.4s">I</a> hope the gentleman doesn't mind if I amend it to request the same at the foot of Forest Street at Salem with a right turn onto Forest Street and a left turn onto Main as well as the arrow that goes straight up High Street because I see a lot of confusion in front of Modern Pastry in that area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=769.695s">But</a> I think it's a great resolution and it's certainly something that I support wholeheartedly, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1174.208s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1175.999s">I'm</a> seeing here in the paperwork that was submitted by the code enforcement officer that an auto establishment in the C2 zone requires a special permit from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1182.864s">That</a> was the matter that these people are here before us for, but he also made a recommendation that the parking area associated with the business be limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1189.73s">And</a> I think that that's what Councilor Caraviello is trying to implement at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1193.413s">However,</a> I think that it's also important that they produce to this council a copy of their parking plan so that we can actually see.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=1213.318s">Well,</a> I know, but I meant by that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3360.272s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3362.193s">I,</a> too, am opposed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3363.534s">I</a> feel as though the scope is far too large. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3365.995s">The</a> impact that it's going to have on traffic, the potential impact it could have on our public schools, the certain impact that it's going to have on the quality of life of the surrounding neighborhood, as well as the lack of affordable units certainly make this a project that I feel as though something that I can't personally support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3381.604s">However,</a> this matter is not something that's before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3384.242s">And</a> I, for one, would certainly support and stand away from trying to influence unduly the decision that the Zoning Board of Appeals makes. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3394.887s">However,</a> the matter that's before this council doesn't ask the Zoning Board of Appeals to oppose the project or to approve the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3400.089s">The</a> matter asks for the Zoning Board of Appeals to delay its decision until more community input can be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3405.111s">And</a> that's something, Mr. President, that I can certainly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3408.352s">I</a> feel as though that the Zoning Board of Appeals should operate free from or under influence, but I also feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3413.05s">The</a> decisions that they're making have a direct and significant impact on the quality of life of the residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3419.035s">One</a> thing that I haven't heard any of my colleagues talk about is, with an addition of 790 units, there's going to be a need to provide additional city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3425.9s">And</a> although we've seen an improvement in the way we've been providing services in recent weeks, in recent months, I don't think we have the capacity to deal with that as well right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3434.647s">The</a> impact that it's going to have on our actual underground and aboveground infrastructure, Mr. President, is something that's going to have to be looked at a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3442.285s">with</a> scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3442.965s">So</a> for those reasons, Mr. President, I am going to be in support of this resolution, asking that the Zoning Board of Appeals delays this decision until a public hearing can be heard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3646.845s">Um,</a> Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3647.826s">I'd</a> like to further amend the paper as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3649.487s">Um,</a> I'd like to ask that the zoning administrator report back to the city council as to what the current zoning is at the site, what the conforming uses are.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=3674.339s">How</a> the property is now zoned and... How the property is now zoned and what the conforming uses are currently based upon a zoning table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4543.735s">I</a> can say that the building on the corner of Winthrop Street and High Street has 116 units in it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4550.877s">That</a> was one of his buildings, and I think it's a... You think it's a... There's 116 units on the corner of Winthrop and High at that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4558.4s">And</a> that's just in one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=4559.62s">So,</a> if it's a... The scope of that's six times the size.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6567.341s">On</a> that motion, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6570.322s">Mr.</a> President, I think we discussed this matter just a few weeks ago, and I think this was something that we were all on the same page <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6575.496s">We're</a> sitting here, we're asking our school department to conserve water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6578.097s">We're</a> establishing a tiered system to encourage our residents to conserve water. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6583.958s">But</a> we're not monitoring our own intake. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6585.579s">And</a> I think what's good for the goose should be good for the gander. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=6588.36s">And</a> I certainly support Councilor Marksley's resolution wholeheartedly, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8663.381s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8665.002s">Thank</a> you both for being here this evening too. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8666.384s">I</a> appreciate your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8669.366s">So</a> as I understand it, based upon what you're telling us, the paper before us is for the city council to authorize your office via the mayor to enter into a contract with the MAPC in good energy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8682.39s">And</a> how did the MAPC and Good Energy become the people that we said, these are the ones we're going to go with?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8850.751s">And</a> the reason I ask is because it seems like <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8854.316s">This</a> is going to be a contract that's over $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8856.316s">It</a> seems like it's something you're negotiating, and you've selected the vendors already. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8860.977s">We</a> might be able to get more bang for our buck if we put out an IRP and said, three vendors come and give it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8865.858s">I</a> don't know if we can do that through municipal aggregation, and I guess that's one of the questions.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8892.264s">So</a> actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8893.265s">The</a> RFP is going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8894.606s">It's,</a> I mean, a request for proposals and bids are going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8897.108s">You</a> guys are doing it on a larger scale.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8901.132s">They're</a> doing the administrative work for us.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8936.655s">So</a> what I'm understanding is that good energy is the, <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8940.365s">preferred</a> vendor that's been selected by MAPC through their due diligence process?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8946.567s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8947.288s">And</a> as you were filling me in on some of these questions that I had, I did hear you say, so we'd get a bill and a bill would come in the mail and it would be, today it's national grid, tomorrow we're entering into municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8963.0s">Is</a> it, you know, good guy energy or is it still a national grid bill?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8990.996s">we</a> might contract with. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=8995.601s">We</a> enter into a three-year contract for municipal aggregation, and I decide to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9004.611s">Two</a> and a half, I say, I want to opt back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9006.853s">Am</a> I allowed to opt out and in as many times as I want with no penalty, no charge, no fee, no pain, no suffering?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9041.612s">And</a> then the scope of contract would be limited to a three year contract by law because it's a municipal contract.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9067.395s">That</a> answers all my questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9068.816s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9069.397s">Thank</a> you very much for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9070.317s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=9071.858s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10039.702s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's rather clear, based upon the tenor and tone of the discussions that we've had this evening, that we're not going to be able to make a decision as to whether or not this is a matter that should go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10048.725s">And</a> as such, I would recommend to make a motion that the matter be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/a52ZUinVlks&t=10052.386s">The</a> motion to table by Councilor Knight.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1031.664s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1033.365s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1034.505s">I</a> think when Dr. Starello referred to 17 employees in the Department of Public Works, he was referring to 17 employees that were just exclusively assigned to the highway division. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1043.827s">But,</a> Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to request <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1046.757s">that</a> the matter be referred to the administration for inclusion in the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1051.581s">We</a> just met with the mayor's office this morning, and they said that they're in the process of putting together a capital budget and a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1057.065s">And</a> this is a capital expenditure, Mr. President, so I'd ask that they also put this on their list of items to add to the capital plan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1191.439s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1193.48s">Mr.</a> President, I don't feel as though we should be making one project contingent upon another. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1197.582s">Two</a> weeks ago, we sat here and we talked about sidewalks, and there's a dire need for us to repair our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1202.184s">Last</a> week, we talked about sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1203.605s">We</a> talked about how there was a dire need to repair our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1206.279s">There's</a> certainly a dire need to repair many of our streets, Evans Street being one of them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1210.561s">But</a> I don't feel as though holding one construction project hostage and make it contingent upon another is a good policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=1217.144s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2194.542s">Mr.</a> Knight Mr. President, I think Counsel Knox took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2198.063s">A</a> traffic management plan is something that I think we're going to need to start requiring when we start allowing public utilities to open up the ground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2206.284s">And</a> looking at this particular paper, I'm happy to see that the work is going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2211.182s">done</a> from curb to curb, and I believe that this is done under a program, I think it's called SRFO or SROF, where the public utility actually gives the city the money, and then the city's responsible for going curb to curb, and the utility's actually going to get out of the pavement business and allow the city to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2226.507s">So</a> that I'm very excited about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2228.229s">And</a> that's also something I think we really need to take a long, hot look at and make standard on. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2231.972s">You</a> know, we have the residents from Evans Street here talking about how patchwork repairs in the street have created a situation that they're in now where the place is falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2239.499s">And</a> I think that as we move forward and we start opening streets up, we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2243.842s">really</a> consider going curb-to-curb in the closing up of our streets when the work is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2248.524s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, provided that the public safety impact around our school is going to be addressed, I certainly have no problem with the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2457.686s">Move</a> approval Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2849.5s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2852.722s">May</a> 26th represents a one-year anniversary of the passing of firefighter Timothy Brennan, a lifelong Metro resident who was known to be seen running around Barry Park as a child and running in and out of burning buildings as a firefighter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2866.149s">He</a> sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2866.909s">He</a> was a great public servant, but more importantly, he was a great friend and a great family man, Mr. President, and I ask that the council <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=2872.438s">Indulge</a> me in remembering him on this anniversary date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4791.947s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the paper to request that the traffic commission waive the tickets for all residents who purchase a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=4798.771s">Same</a> thing, but at least we can make official action of the traffic commission.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5270.387s">Mr.</a> President, I for one was satisfied at the last presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5273.768s">I</a> feel as though our sidewalks need to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5275.829s">I</a> feel as though a $500,000 appropriation is a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5278.791s">I</a> don't think it's a good place to finish, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5281.113s">But</a> with that being said, I think there were certain individual councilors here that had more concern than I did as to whether or not this was a worthwhile appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/B3oaa8YVtBA&t=5287.536s">Very</a> good.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3331.757s">Mr.</a> President, I think, um, uh, rather important question that we should be asking is why the school department is paying down this bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3340.251s">I</a> think if we take a look at all the other bonded debt that we have in the city, whether it be the science labs, the school pool, the rebuilding of our new schools, the debt was carried by the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3351.863s">And</a> in this instance, and I can't think of any other instance that's occurring at this point in time or in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3357.163s">where</a> the school budget would actually be required to use their operational funds to fund the bonded debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3363.826s">So</a> I think the real question is, why is the school department responsible for paying the bonded debt? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3368.388s">Why</a> is that not coming from the city side? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3370.349s">Because</a> as far as I can tell, and my research would indicate, that this is the only instance where that's happened in the history of the city since, you know, the last 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3381.707s">So</a> I think that's really the question to ask, Mr. President, is why is the school department being required to pay down the bond at Edgeley Field based on operating expenses, when every other bond in the community, including the new pool, including the building of the new schools, was covered through the city side?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3401.615s">I</a> think the question would have to be asked to the budget director of the Office of Administration and Finance in the schools, in contrast with that of our <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3410.893s">budget</a> office here in the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3413.095s">Um,</a> you know, why is this the best way to go about it in terms of, um, paying down the debt? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3416.878s">Why</a> is the school department being saddled with this burden through their operational account? <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=3421.021s">Because</a> their ability to raise revenues is far more restricted than ours as, as the city government.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5076.062s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5078.362s">Many</a> of us behind this rail and many of us in this community know John Jack Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5081.503s">He's</a> served our community diligently for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5084.764s">I</a> believe Jack was a school committee member when I was in elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5088.545s">I</a> had the good fortune of growing up <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5090.873s">a</a> neighbor to him, and he's been a great asset to our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5095.676s">Last</a> month was his last meeting as the chairperson of the Hormel Commission, and he has stepped down from public service at this point in time, and he is officially retired. <a href="https://youtu.be/zvHrHUNZKmI&t=5104.222s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Buckley and thank him for all the work that he's done on behalf of the citizenry here in Medford, and I'd also like to have him come down to a council meeting and receive an official council commendation highlighting and denoting his many years of service that we appreciate here in the city.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA/2025-03-21_6eg7OrlpwNA.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 26, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1250.251s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1251.895s">An</a> interesting situation happened down in Duxbury that was very similar to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1255.297s">A</a> gentleman bought a parcel of land, and in the backyard of this parcel was a very old tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1262.3s">And</a> there was a bunch of community outcry to save the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1265.822s">And</a> the gentleman had spent close to a million dollars on buying a piece of land that was waterfront property, and he didn't want to save the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1271.244s">And</a> it was his land, and he didn't want to save it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1273.155s">And</a> that was all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1274.416s">And</a> what happened was the community and the property owner got together and they sat down and they devised a plan to move the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1280.92s">So</a> if, in fact, the property owner has intentions of taking the tree down, Mr. President, I'm wondering if our tree warden would be willing to take a look at it and maybe give the council an estimate with how much it would cost to actually move the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1292.708s">And</a> I'm sure if the property owner is going to be cutting the tree down, he'd be just as willing to donate it to the city if the city would be willing to remove the tree and plant it elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1302.453s">It's</a> huge, it's absolutely huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1303.993s">I</a> know it's gigantic, there's no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1306.094s">And</a> the tree in Duxbury was gigantic as well, but they were able to move it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=1309.515s">So</a> that's why I raised the issue as to what she thinks the cost might be associated with that, if they'd be able to move the tree as opposed to cutting it down if it came to that circumstance, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2422.558s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2424.64s">And</a> Mr. Carroll, we had a long conversation last week about this topic, and it's something that I'm well aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2430.164s">And</a> I apologize on behalf of the city and the state for what you have to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2435.208s">And</a> I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2436.922s">You</a> and your family are able to fare the storms until we can get some sort of resolve here for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2441.925s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2443.606s">And</a> I'd like to ask that our city point person from the engineering department report to the council what steps have been taken to ensure the accountability of the contractors.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2506.03s">And</a> because I think, Mr. President, it's one thing for us to keep asking for some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=2510.629s">but</a> there should be some sort of record or documentation of what's being done, what phone calls are being made, whether they're in non-compliance, whether they're in compliance, whether or not, you know, the simple and small items that will affect the quality of life that are really not very costly are being done so that we can all live together and get along and get this project over with without impeding construction but also allowing the businesses to be successful.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4187.535s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4190.977s">I</a> think we're all receiving a lot of the same calls, and more importantly, we're all seeing the mess that's out there when we drive down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4199.502s">And</a> not to pick on Tufts University, but, I mean, I think the fact of the matter is, when students move out of their apartments, they are leaving Medford, and they don't have a vested interest in Medford, so they don't really care what kind of mess they leave behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4211.929s">A</a> couple years ago, Mr. President, the city of Somerville adopted an ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4215.715s">and</a> the City of Boston has adopted an ordinance, and the City of Medford has discussed adopting an ordinance, and I think that it's something we should take a look at, which would be a university accountability ordinance, Mr. President, which would require the university to register with the city <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4230.212s">the</a> units that are being rented by students, so that we know where they are, so that if issues of public safety come up, we know how to identify them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4237.636s">I</a> mean, God forbid there was an outbreak of a contagious disease or something like that up on the campus, at least at this point in time, we'd be able to identify where these people live, and if we needed to quarantine them, so be it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4303.404s">It's</a> my understanding, Mr. President, that Tufts University, who operates a school in Boston, is complying with the Boston ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4309.248s">And</a> from what I understand, they're also complying with the Sumner ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4311.83s">So,</a> you know, but I think that Councilman Mack makes a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4316.453s">Garbage</a> in, garbage out. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4317.293s">If</a> they're not giving us good information, it doesn't matter anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4319.915s">They</a> need to give us good information and they need to be a partner in this and they need to be sure that they have the same concerns that we have relative to the quality of life in this community and in the neighborhoods and protecting the neighborhoods, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4331.853s">Councilor</a> Caraviello has a great quote when it comes to Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4334.475s">I</a> think he says, Somerville gets all the benefits and Medford gets the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4338.058s">And,</a> you know, I think it's time that we really take a look at that and we try to leverage our partnership with Tufts University.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4748.528s">Mr.</a> President, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4749.428s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4750.148s">And</a> Councilman Marks, thank you for bringing this matter up. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4754.17s">On</a> May 5th at six o'clock in room 201, the city administration is going to be having a public meeting concerning <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4761.737s">the</a> Complete Streets Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4763.318s">And</a> in our packet this week, we had a meeting notice that referred to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4767.899s">And</a> the Complete Streets Program refers to roadways that are designed and operated for safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transit users of all ages and abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4779.084s">So</a> what this is, is it's a program where you sign up with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and they help you adopt some best practices, and they provide funding on how to implement those best practices, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4790.884s">I</a> think that this will be a great event for all, especially in light of the commentary and in segue to the commentary that Councilor Marks just made. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=4798.47s">So</a> I'd just like to be sure that everybody is aware that that's going on from 6 to 7 on May 5th in Room 201 here at City Hall.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5333.745s">Mr.</a> President, yes, I'd certainly like to take a look at that contract too. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5338.488s">You</a> know, Mr. Bellson's been a fixture in this community for so many years and he does an excellent job in his endeavors, Mr. President, and we're very lucky to have him. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5348.694s">If</a> you look at the salary of our superintendent versus those and people in surrounding communities, you'll see that we're getting them at bargain prices, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5356.179s">So</a> I certainly would be <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5359.205s">welcoming</a> an opportunity to review the contract as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5361.526s">However,</a> I do want to be sure that we take the appropriate steps to protect our bargaining position at the table and our negotiating position at the table as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6eg7OrlpwNA&t=5368.63s">So,</a> going forward, I just want to be cautious in that regard.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o/2025-03-21_nXRer8wKd5o.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 19, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=534.072s">Mr.</a> President, a motion to waive the reading of each individual matter that's on the paper, and a motion to accept the committee report.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=654.033s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I appreciate you bearing with my long-winded resolution this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=659.917s">However,</a> I feel as though it's very important that we begin to hold our public utilities a little bit more accountable to the work that they do on our roadways, on our sidewalks, as well as dealing with the trees that end up getting wrapped around public utility wires up in the sky, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=673.184s">So</a> I bring this resolution forward based upon a constituent call that I received back about a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=678.167s">Doonan</a> Street was done over, and public utilities were on Doonan Street, and they dug quite a large trench, and it was a trench that went up the whole length of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=687.172s">And</a> the size of the equipment actually damaged the majority of the street up there, and the street's still not been repaired, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=693.315s">And</a> I know that there are a number of other streets in the community that have this same situation happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=698.075s">I'd</a> like a list of the streets as noted in the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=701.719s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=706.164s">I've</a> also asked for the trees that need to be cut down that are the responsibilities of public utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=711.089s">Just</a> in the news last week, Mr. President, we saw <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=714.12s">couple</a> down in Abington who were struck by a falling tree branch and killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=719.382s">And</a> there are many trees in the city that are wrapped up in the electric wires and the city of Medford will not cut them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=725.905s">The</a> public utility is responsible for cutting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=728.766s">So</a> I'd like a list of those to make sure that we can monitor the work and be sure that it's done, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1462.908s">Can</a> I further amend the paper, Mr. President, to ask for a directed patrol there for the next couple of weeks, just to be sure that we monitor the activity there as well as that it's getting more and more stuck in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1470.932s">So</a> if you want to go down that route, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1472.613s">Thanks,</a> Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1887.212s">On</a> Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1890.345s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I think we've made a number of resolutions relative to the C-Click-Fix program since the press release came out about its inception. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1898.553s">And</a> I think that Councilor Falco, Councilor Luxembourg, the Grand Trafficking Committee, the Board of Governors, and I think that I understand and can kind of grasp <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1906.501s">as</a> to how this program is going to work, whether or not we have enough personnel and manpower behind it to support the initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1913.17s">The</a> timelines that are being set forward, Mr. President, so with that being said, I owe a lot of your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=1918.076s">So</a> it was a matter of being able to be able to pay this forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2951.129s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2952.529s">This</a> new resolution was filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2954.89s">I</a> just wanted to just elect a notice to the residents on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2957.67s">A</a> couple of weeks ago, I went up to the engineering division after a simple phone call from a constituent asking about the lines that are located on the street for cutting and excavation. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2968.633s">And</a> I went to the engineering division, and they said, <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2970.993s">Since</a> that time, they have put, what was the construction? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2991.406s">residence</a> doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2992.106s">However,</a> there are still some questions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=2994.148s">So</a> I'd ask the administration to provide us with a timeline of construction, at least at this point, versus the scope and purposes for a drainage project that this council actually approved the funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3005.817s">There</a> are going to be a significant number of restrictions on the road at this point, as is the number of pedestrians in the absence of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3013.68s">I'd</a> just like to talk about communication, the engineering and planning to the residents of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3019.182s">First</a> of all, as to what's going to be going on, what constraints are going to be in place, what restrictions are going to be on the expected potential of the road.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3332.209s">Do</a> we? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3333.21s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=3333.651s">And</a> we invited her, but I think it might've been when Councilor Falco was.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=4595.551s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask the administration the question as to whether or not we actually received a qualified, received and accepted a qualified bidder for the running of the community access programs.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5038.08s">I</a> do believe when Barbara Kerr was here recently discussing some of the plans for the library, one of the things that was raised was that there was a deeded restriction on the library because that land was donated to the city of Medford and the only purpose that it could be used for was for a library, if I remember correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5051.233s">So</a> maybe we can ask that question to see as to whether or not there's a deeded restriction on the library and as to see as to whether or not there is any other use that would be appropriate there other than a library.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5661.834s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, I think it's also very important for us to point out the fact that every time that the library comes up on our agenda, this council chamber has a good number of people here that are speaking in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5673.984s">And</a> if we're going to talk about changing the use of the library, the direction the library is going in, I think it's very important to include these individuals as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5680.309s">So</a> I'd ask that the friends of the public library be invited to our next committee of the whole meeting when it does take place to discuss this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5687.681s">I'd</a> also ask that the city clerk compile a list of all the individuals that have come up to speak in favor of issues going on at the library so that an invitation could be extended to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5696.687s">As</a> amended by Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5769.485s">And</a> just to be clear, Mr. President, if we're going to, when I said invite the friends of the library and those people who have come down to speak in favor of the needs at the library, it's if in fact this council is going to deliberate a discussion of changing the use of the library and moving it away from just being a library, whether it's to add a second floor, make that TV three, or whatever it is, whatever direction we're going, I think that they should be involved in at least the conversation to provide their input, because those are the people that have supported the efforts of the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5794.332s">When</a> the library went through its worst times, they were the ones that held it up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=5814.478s">I'm</a> more concerned about the building and the actual use than I am about the money coming from the state.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6215.131s">I'm</a> pretty sure that for quite some time now, a plan's been published that they were going to put the public access station up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6220.555s">So</a> I don't think that this should be a surprise that it's going up the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6223.557s">It's</a> been in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6224.417s">It's</a> been in the transcript, right, Alex? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6226.409s">It's</a> been in there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6227.15s">You</a> put it in the paper that it was going to go up the high school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6230.192s">The</a> public access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6231.753s">Now</a> they start construction, now it's a big surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6233.835s">I</a> mean, you know, I'm a little confused about the disconnect there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6237.237s">We've</a> all been well aware that that's the location that they've... <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6239.943s">said</a> that they were going to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6240.904s">Whether</a> we like it or not, it's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6243.066s">Whether</a> we like it or not, it's a different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6244.948s">But,</a> you know, we know that that's what they're going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6247.331s">Now</a> we see progress in them breaking ground, and now we're not happy that they're breaking ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6250.434s">I'm</a> a little confused by this whole thing, Mr. President, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6253.457s">But</a> that's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nXRer8wKd5o&t=6255.079s">Thank</a> you, Councilman Knight.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=245.794s">It</a> was underestimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=246.694s">It</a> was underestimated on the mitigation for the pollution underground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=249.635s">Yes,</a> yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=251.035s">And</a> we've passed a couple of readings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=253.256s">And</a> I would move for approval on the third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=254.717s">It</a> has to get paid one way or the other, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=256.357s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=462.085s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=509.432s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, it's my understanding that this is just a simple clarification of the existing outdoor dining license ordinance that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/RZGyI63vqfU&t=517.299s">There</a> was some misinterpretation of the legislative intent that's been addressed through the language in this newly crafted zoning ordinance, and I move for approval.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_X_nYXZZ4ChY/2025-03-21_X_nYXZZ4ChY.html">Medford, MA City Council - Apr. 5, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=606.651s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=607.392s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper to request a report from the C-Click Fix Program relative to the requests to remove graffiti.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=978.84s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=980.301s">In</a> our council packet this week, we received a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=983.714s">to</a> Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke from Paul Moki, the Building Commissioner, in response to this Council's inquiry as to recommendations relative to Zoning Ordinance 194-191. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=998.304s">The</a> intent of that particular division is to reduce congestion in the streets and to contribute to traffic safety by assuring adequate places for the standing and storing of off-street motor vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1008.61s">Mr.</a> President, we have a response that provides us with a number of different options here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1013.288s">And</a> in the interest of due diligence and an open and transparent process, I'd like to call for a Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee, Mr. President, to review the response and to make recommendations to this August body as to changes in our zoning law to allow people to park in the front of their homes and change the current zoning ordinances that would call for 15 feet of frontage being required for the front yard of each home. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1042.632s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1361.612s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1362.893s">And</a> Councilor Marks, thank you very much, because I concur 110 percent with what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1368.596s">We</a> have individuals in City Hall that have a relationship with those in state agencies that have that so-called backdoor phone number that they can pick up and call and be connected to the government affairs liaison at these agencies, whereas a regular citizen would have to <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1382.046s">pick</a> up the phone and go through the switchboard and then be bounced around from department to department until they get the right person on the phone and then be told, oh, sorry, there's nothing we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1391.491s">We'll</a> get back to you in a day, a week, a month, a year, not hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1394.572s">I</a> think that the whole purpose and intent of the see, click, fix program is to see it, to click it, and to fix it, not to see it, click it, and get a homework assignment to go fix it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1403.937s">So</a> with that being said, Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1406.918s">I</a> support this measure wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1817.743s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1818.904s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1819.544s">Miller</a> and Chief Gilberti, for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1821.806s">Chief,</a> can you tell me how old the current equipment is?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1832.093s">And</a> the SCBA for people that aren't firefighters is the mask and the oxygen tank that they wear when they go into a burning building. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1840.66s">And</a> the last time we've had them is from 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1841.781s">Mr.</a> President, I don't think anybody behind this rail drives a car from 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1845.644s">I</a> think that this is a good appropriation and something that <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1850.31s">we</a> should support, especially based on the fact that we're going to get a 90% reimbursement from the government or up to a 90% reimbursement from the government, uh, God willing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1857.415s">So,</a> um, with that being said, Mr. President, I think this is a, a good paper to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X_nYXZZ4ChY&t=1861.577s">I</a> think that it's going to make our firefighters safer and that it should be supported.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7nvtKAs6nf0/2025-03-21_7nvtKAs6nf0.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 29, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=538.565s">Motion</a> to suspend the rules, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=549.713s">I'd</a> like to take paper 16295 relative to the personnel ordinance related to our fire department and their compensation package that is now completed at its first and second reading, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=584.239s">Mr.</a> President, I'd move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=585.58s">The</a> reason the matter was tabled was not that anybody behind this rail had a problem with it, I don't think, but it was to give the public an opportunity to digest the package. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=592.73s">and</a> to have an opportunity to speak if, in fact, they were opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=595.611s">It</a> doesn't seem like anybody here in the audience is here today to oppose the hardworking men and women of our fire department from receiving a cost of living adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=602.852s">So</a> as such, Mr. President, I would move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1446.644s">Um,</a> Mr. President, as a point of order, we have paper one six dash three, three, nine offered by Councilor for alcohol, which is a similar subject matter, uh, speaks about the complete streets grants program, pedestrian safety issues and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1458.771s">So</a> it might make sense to take this matter up with the other papers that we're discussing at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1462.673s">However,</a> um, I'll leave that up to the body, but, um, it seems like, you know, the three papers that we've discussed right now all have something to do with, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1471.213s">pedestrian</a> safety and the complete streets grant program, but we can keep it separated if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1476.096s">It</a> just seems like we're having the conversation, go with the flow, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=1479.638s">Instead</a> of stopping the conversation, start it again later on in the meeting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2418.016s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2419.496s">And</a> I'd like to thank Superintendent Belson publicly for his work in putting a packet together for us to review here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2425.238s">In</a> the review of this packet, I did notice that one of the steps that the City of Medford has taken is to train all of our school nurses how to administer Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2434.4s">And</a> one of the questions that I would have for the superintendent is that that's an excellent policy to put in place, but what happens after the Narcan is administered? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2442.543s">Is</a> there a follow-up policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2444.554s">what</a> controls are in place to ensure that an individual who required the administration of Narcan is going to be provided with the resources and tools to go towards recovery, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2455.881s">So</a> I'd like to amend the paper and ask that question to the superintendent of schools as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2832.71s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem reviewing our zoning and the zoning here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2836.592s">I</a> do think it is due time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2839.194s">However,</a> to conduct a zoning needs analysis, I think we first need to determine what it is we're trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2845.839s">Are</a> we trying to accomplish increasing the stock of affordable housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2848.781s">Are</a> we trying to accomplish <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2851.365s">preserving</a> more open space or creating more open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2854.707s">We're</a> trying to accomplish creating overlay districts so that we can have mixed use development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2859.709s">So</a> those are some of the questions that I have for the councilor, Mr. President, and I'm hoping through you that he'll be able to answer some of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2865.272s">Ultimately,</a> we have an open space plan here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2867.473s">We</a> have an affordable housing plan here in the city of Medford and many other plans that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2871.375s">And</a> I think that based on my reading on this, that the council would mean that we conduct a zoning needs analysis to be sure that these plans come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=2878.782s">However,</a> I did have the question, and I'd feel more comfortable voting in favor of the matter if the gentleman could explain that to me a little bit better.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3117.377s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3118.258s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3120.018s">Mr.</a> President, I'm very reluctant to spend $200,000 or $100,000 with no specific goal in mind other than a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3127.001s">I</a> certainly think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3128.261s">I</a> certainly think it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3130.202s">I've</a> brought forward resolutions in the past two meetings that have discussed zoning ordinances and the way that our zoning is set up, trying to see if we can address the issue of people being able to put an extra parking spot in front of their homes even though it's in front of the home and it's not legal right now because of the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3146.547s">So</a> I certainly understand what <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3148.862s">coming</a> from, I just think it needs to be looked at a little bit harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3151.804s">Ultimately,</a> you know, if we want to focus our efforts just on the zoning in Medford Square, maybe we focus on just the zoning in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3158.708s">Maybe</a> that doesn't cost $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3159.829s">Maybe</a> we can accomplish that goal by spending $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3162.611s">But</a> until we really figure out what our goal is, spending the money to hire somebody with no goal at the end of the day just doesn't make sense to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3172.217s">But</a> with that being said, I certainly would support the matter going to subcommittee so we can properly vet this because I think it's a noble cause.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3202.831s">Well,</a> it says the administration and the city council take all measures necessary, including if it has to happen, hire an outside consultant, but I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3210.287s">If</a> we sit down in subcommittee and try to focus our efforts on establishing goals, we might not need to go that far to hire an outside consultant to examine all the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3217.672s">Maybe</a> limit the scope of it or expand the scope of it for that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3222.175s">I</a> just think that there's a certain need for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3224.657s">I</a> don't think that the administration is going to be opposed to working with the city council to take all measures necessary to ensure that the neighborhoods in the city of Medford are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3232.342s">I</a> don't think that this council is going to stand in the way of that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=3234.243s">I</a> just think we want to do it the right way and have a plan and a goal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4103.335s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4104.375s">Mr.</a> President, while we're talking snow, I think it might make sense for us to request, so I'd like to amend the paper, that the DPW director report back the status of our snow and ice budget.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4230.951s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4231.852s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to further amend the paper to request that the highway superintendent make recommendations as to what the proper equipment would be to use to clean it, to clear a sidewalk.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4331.896s">Mr.</a> Chairman, after consultation with the other members on the subcommittee, we'd be willing to meet on the 19th of April at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4339.738s">in</a> the council committee room. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4341.919s">What</a> night of the week is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4343.399s">That</a> is a Tuesday evening, and we'd ask the city clerk to post the notices.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4357.132s">Mr.</a> President, this is all contingent on being able to secure the folks from the administration to be able to attend.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4467.844s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4468.684s">Last</a> week, a gentleman from Ridgeway Road was here and we had some discussions about some of the problems relative to traffic that he's having on his roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4476.077s">There's</a> also several residents on Upland and Leonard Circle who have called concerning the amount of vehicles, meaning volume, as well as the speed of vehicles that are traveling up and down that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4488.682s">Anybody</a> who knows Ridgeway Road knows it runs from Fulton to the Fells Way, is a major cut through street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4495.104s">And</a> there are posted signs that would say that it's resident access only for certain hours, very similar to the recommendation that this council made. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4503.444s">on</a> behalf of Councilor Marksley's resolution for Oakland Street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4506.947s">So</a> I'm asking that the Traffic Division of our Medford Police Department direct some patrols during the rush hour times of day at that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4515.694s">Driving</a> down a resident-only roadway when it's clearly posted that it's only for resident access is actually a surchargeable offense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4523.82s">So</a> I think people that are using this road as a cut-through will learn very quick when they get an insurance surcharge that they should obey the signage that's on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4531.977s">So</a> with that being said, I move for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4630.417s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4635.64s">The</a> assessor's office will be handling the notification issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4639.163s">The</a> role of the Community Preservation Act Ad Hoc Subcommittee is to create the <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4646.632s">mandated</a> community preservation commission and the structure thereof, which would focus on whether or not there are term limits, how the people are selected, the criteria for selection, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4659.32s">So</a> the subcommittee has not had any dealings with the administration relative to the issuance of variances, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4667.705s">And</a> that's part of the legislation that was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4670.51s">So</a> I think that that's something that's a little bit outside the scope of what the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on the CPA is doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4676.112s">What</a> we're doing here is creating a list of recommended proposals for the general public to give, provide input on, and then for the city council to examine and then make decisions with all this information that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4689.516s">So</a> with that being said, I guess it's a really long, long, long way of telling Councilor Longo no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4695.233s">We</a> don't have any information on that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4958.654s">The</a> President Yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4961.957s">That's</a> Friday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4963.037s">We</a> have the Russo event, the Raise Up of Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4965.959s">And</a> then, on Saturday evening at the Intercontinental Hotel, Mr. President, an annual event is being held, the Autism Gala, sponsored by Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4974.465s">And</a> annually, the Autism Gala is held to raise money for autism awareness here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and across the country, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7nvtKAs6nf0&t=4982.154s">And</a> tickets can be found at www.teamstidslocal25.com if people are interested in going.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KSMq75MSz54/2025-03-21_KSMq75MSz54.html">Medford, MA City Council - Mar. 15, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=643.169s">Mr.</a> President, in review of the ordinance and in my discussions with Councilor Rumley when I received this in my packet, I see no problem with the proposed language and I would move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=651.631s">If</a> my fellow colleagues have anything to say, I'd certainly welcome the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=654.711s">But</a> as far as I can see, this looks like the paper just clarifies a problem that was discussed and identified by the council in previous sessions and terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=661.653s">And</a> right now, it's our opportunity to correct the inaccuracies of the prior ordinance, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=729.563s">Well,</a> we have a motion before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=732.325s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=733.306s">I</a> certainly have no problem with reviewing the matter in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=736.608s">However,</a> I feel as though where it's a zoning issue, that the zoning and ordinance subcommittee would be the appropriate place to look at it, if in fact that's the approach we're going to take.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=746.194s">I</a> withdraw my motion for approval, Mr. President, and make a motion to refer to the zoning and ordinance subcommittee.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=950.253s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=950.573s">Miller,</a> if I remember correctly, the engineering firm that was hired gave us some engineering plans relative to the replacement of the drains on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=958.778s">Those</a> plans were inaccurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=959.898s">Public</a> utilities had to be moved, which resulted in a cost overrun on this project, if I remember correctly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=992.187s">And</a> this $350,000 is owed to the people that actually did the work as opposed to the engineering firm, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1171.222s">While</a> we're under suspension, Councilor Knight, I move to take paper 15-734, loan order additional DPW facility project funds in the amount of $300,000 off the table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1219.0s">for</a> a first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1219.941s">Mr.</a> President, looking through the breakdown of the legislative history of this piece of legislation, this paper was brought before the council due to underestimation of contaminants at a DPW site, and as such, there was some cost overruns related to the removal of contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1240.217s">Because</a> of that, we had to add to the project scope, and that cost about $300,000 is my understanding, but I think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/KSMq75MSz54&t=1245.621s">Miller</a> will be able to give us a better breakdown than I.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=213.032s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=214.993s">Several</a> weeks, just a couple weeks ago, the administration put a paper forward for an ordinance change relative to a reorganization of the executive office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=222.375s">This</a> council had some questions that needed to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=225.517s">We</a> had in our packets this week response to the questions that we had asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=229.799s">I'd</a> ask the current budget director to maybe come up and go over the response that the administration sent forward to us, and maybe we can get these papers off of the list of unfinished business this evening, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1106.812s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly can understand where Councilor Marksley is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1112.938s">I</a> don't think we're talking about reorganizing the wheel here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1116.641s">We're</a> just moving a couple positions around in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=1118.943s">But</a> if he feels as though it's going to be an impediment to open and transparent government, Mr. President, I'm not going to stand in the way of that and I'll be happy to withdraw my motion.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2787.804s">The</a> paper was filed, Mr. President, to start a discussion, to start a discussion on making a reform that's going to work best for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=2793.589s">So</a> I certainly have no problem with that whatsoever.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5041.027s">Mr.</a> President, I think that we have a couple of different avenues we could take to address the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5048.571s">I'd</a> be happy to call a <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5051.072s">subcommittee</a> meeting on intergovernmental affairs, see if we can get our representatives from the state house down here as well as representatives from the administration, from the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5059.674s">And</a> from the project to sit down in the same room and see if we can work something out, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5087.372s">I</a> think, Mr. President, I went down last Wednesday evening at the request of a business owner to a site visit down there, and there's a lot of signage that's very confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5097.92s">I</a> certainly don't think that there's a accessible pathway to get from <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5103.324s">the</a> parking facility behind Donuts with a difference to, say, REMAX or that side of the square, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5109.608s">So</a> I think that there's a number of issues going on that are something we can address. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5116.052s">But</a> the way we're going to get them done, I think, is by working together and sitting down in the same room and trying to iron them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5122.075s">I</a> think that we could have Diane McLeod and the Office of Disability take a look at the accessible pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5127.354s">I</a> think there are a number of different approaches that we could take, and I just think it's about sitting down and coming up with a comprehensive strategy where we're all on the same page, working to effectuate the same positive goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5137.2s">Mr.</a> President, I think that DOT is standing in the way of us trying to get something done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5141.743s">And</a> unless we show a unified front, we're not going to be able to accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5144.625s">That's</a> why I say it might be time that we bring our elected delegation, as well as the administration, into the same room and develop a strategy as to how we're going to approach them and address what's going on and why our requests are falling on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/WZBDDeqA2qI&t=5157.085s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M/2025-03-21_c_1hhrksa9M.html">Medford, MA City Council - Jan. 12, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=3225.773s">Motion</a> to table is discussed in committee of the whole, Mr. President, until the questions are answered.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4324.938s">I</a> believe what came out of the committee of the whole meeting was that the sum of <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4330.24s">The</a> financial impact on the current fiscal year's budget would be $953 for the remainder of 2015, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. President, just for personal peace of mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4342.124s">So</a> if these ordinance changes were passed this evening, the impact it would have on this year's budget would be $953 based upon what was presented to us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4352.67s">We're</a> not going to pass it this evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4358.511s">I</a> think they're filled by now, is what she's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4360.032s">She's</a> trying to reorganize the structure of government.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4364.793s">But</a> they are filled already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4883.59s">I</a> don't really think that it's an appropriate forum for a citizen and a city employee to be debating at the floor of the city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4890.431s">It</a> isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4891.071s">We've</a> met, we've had our committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4893.131s">We</a> have some questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4895.972s">We're</a> going to be having another committee of the whole meeting on that when those questions do get answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4900.013s">However,</a> I don't feel as though it's appropriate for <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4902.507s">individual</a> citizen and a member of the administration to go back and forth at the podium here at the City Council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4907.05s">I</a> think that it detracts from what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4909.132s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=4909.913s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5082.7s">Councilor</a> Knight, I do believe that the executive branch of our municipal government does have something that will be called administrative prerogative, Mr. President, which would be the right to hire, fire, and create positions that they see fit if they fall within the scope of our ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5096.987s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I motion that we table the matter until all questions are answered as previously discussed and agreed upon in the committee of the whole.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5301.35s">This</a> is a committee of the whole, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5661.238s">16-024</a> is ordained. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5664.944s">Motion</a> to revert back to the regular order of business, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5684.08s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5686.462s">Two</a> years ago when I was sworn in as a councilor, we began an exercise where we would meet in the Committee of the Whole to establish goals and priorities for this council moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5694.807s">We'd</a> use that as a template and a basis for our direction as we continue to make legislation here as a legislative body in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5702.491s">I</a> think it was a very helpful endeavor, and it also allowed us an opportunity to begin to prepare for budget discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5708.535s">When</a> I look at the agenda for this evening, I do see another paper on there offered by Councilor Falco relative to establishing a budget template and budget formats, which I'm going to be in full support of tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5720.142s">But</a> I think that this is really a good way for us to start the discussion and to look forward to June. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5724.611s">to</a> see what our priorities are, what steps we're going to take to keep Metro moving in the right direction and to improve the way that we do business.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5730.954s">I'd</a> ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5884.197s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5885.417s">I</a> also had an opportunity to take a look at Chapter 115, Section 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5888.958s">And</a> as Councilor Longo-Kurtz said, that it would be comprised of between five and 15 members. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5893.625s">that</a> are residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5895.665s">But</a> in looking at the general law, and I may be wrong because I haven't had a chance to examine it thoroughly, there is no requirement that those individuals on the Veterans Advisory Committee be veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5906.928s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5907.348s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5907.888s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think it might make sense for us to maybe request that a certain percentage or portion of the individuals appointed to the Veterans Advisory Council when established be veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5923.125s">whether</a> it be 50% plus one of the individual positions that are established by the mayor if she takes us up on this offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5929.088s">I</a> think that that would be... I think that that's a good approach, Councilor Caraviello, taking a two-fold approach where we send the request to the mayor, and then we have an opportunity to make some recommendations and act on her response would probably be the best course. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=5944.754s">So</a> I certainly support the resolution, but ask that the Veterans Subcommittee also take a look at it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6000.504s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, as we're all aware, the city is going to be soon rolling out a 311 program where individuals can make service requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6007.49s">And</a> I think that it would be a good idea if the administration would forward these reports to the city council so that we can have a good understanding as to whether or not the program is actually meeting its stated mission goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6020.662s">So</a> with that being said, I asked my colleagues to support the resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6276.452s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6277.872s">I</a> recently had a discussion with Karen Rose at the Board of Health, who would be the department head that would be responsible for the Substance Abuse Outreach and Prevention Coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6286.914s">She</a> was pleased to inform me that the incumbent on the position, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6289.715s">Penny</a> Funiali, has had her child and is on maternity leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6293.776s">So</a> she will be unable to appear before the council to highlight some of the efforts and successes that the program has had since its inception. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6301.997s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6304.358s">Rose</a> did <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6305.246s">commit</a> to having Penny appear before the council when she does return. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6309.089s">So</a> I'd ask that the council approve this resolution and then when Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=6312.151s">Funigalli</a> returns from her maternity leave, we ask her to come up here and tell us exactly what's going on with the new office and the new position that this council created.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7079.412s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7081.032s">And</a> again, thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7083.873s">I</a> think Councilor Scarpelli hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7087.334s">It's</a> a partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7088.854s">It's</a> a partnership between this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7090.195s">It's</a> a partnership between the administration and the school department and the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7094.576s">And</a> the school department had great success last year, putting together a school budget that was probably the best school budget that I've seen in a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7102.158s">And</a> I think that part of the reason the budget was so successful, because they had <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7106.775s">the</a> narrative budget summary that was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7108.315s">They</a> understood exactly what it was that they were working on and they didn't have to pry through 600 pages of line item budgets and ask every single question about every single line item because there was a narrative there, there was a mission there, there was an objective, a stated goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7121.518s">And</a> I was very pleased to vote in favor of the budget, Mr. President, because of the fact that the school department's budget was so strong and the work that it did in restoring adjustment Councilors, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7131.2s">We</a> could go over the successes time and time again as we have in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7135.8s">However,</a> we also passed a resolution back, I want to say in September, requesting that this council or the budget subcommittee meet quarterly with the administration to determine whether or not forecasts are meeting collections and to see where we are in terms of surplus and accounts and stuff like that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7158.112s">So</a> with that being said, I'd like to see that those meetings start to begin getting called as this council did vote for unanimously by way of a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7165.215s">With</a> that being said, I certainly support this resolution that's before the council today. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7169.078s">I</a> think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7169.899s">It's</a> a great approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7170.619s">It</a> sets the tone for us to start working together now on the most important job that we have, which is setting the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7175.603s">So,</a> Mr. President, I move for approval and I'd ask for a roll call.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7272.471s">Um,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7274.592s">As</a> a frequent, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7275.74s">user</a> of the smartphone application relative to the park mobile system, I received an article, and the article was in an online magazine called The Register. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7288.91s">The</a> headline was, Carr Park Mobile Apps are Vulnerable to Hacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7293.233s">And</a> that made me rather concerned, so I continued to research, and I found another site called Hack Read, which said, researchers find critical vulnerabilities in the Android parking apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7305.287s">and</a> Info Security Magazine. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7307.428s">The</a> headline would read, Researchers Find Major Security Flaws in Parking Apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7311.469s">And</a> what's happening, Mr. President, is that because of substandard encryption, which, quite frankly, means nothing to me, but might mean something more to some people that are a little bit more tech-savvy than I, these phones are becoming vulnerable to attacks because the information is up in the cloud and people are able to get at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7329.015s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, there have been a number of suggestions and recommendations made by these <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7333.917s">And</a> one of the biggest recommendations was that you use a credit card as opposed to a debit card to fund your purchases in your mobile app because of the fraud protections that are in the credit card system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7345.639s">However,</a> Mr. President, we do have a parking program here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7348.5s">We</a> do have a ParkMobile app here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7350.28s">So</a> I would like to see what steps the ParkMobile people are taking to ensure that we do not have substandard encryption and that our consumers are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7359.18s">from</a> cyber attacks, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7361.241s">And</a> in segue to that, if anybody has been affected by a cyber attack of some sort, I would ask that they report the matter immediately to not only the police department, but also the Office of Consumer, the Medford Consumer Commission, rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7375.709s">The</a> First Floor of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7377.591s">First</a> Floor of City Hall, the old Medford Savings Lives Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7381.213s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7383.594s">I</a> think that this is a basic <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7385.654s">resolution</a> that will allow us to understand what steps are being taken to keep consumers in the community safe.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7743.764s">On</a> that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7745.085s">Mr.</a> President, I put the resolution forward to address issues of cyber security. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7750.869s">Although</a> I can understand why certain people are coming from Facebook and this guy got a ticket this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7759.254s">It</a> is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7760.575s">There's</a> an administrative procedure that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7762.976s">If</a> you feel as though you got a ticket, <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7764.852s">erroneously</a> that you go through the appeals process. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7768.034s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I have no problem amending the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7773.536s">However,</a> the principle that I wrote for was just exclusively for cybersecurity, and we kind of went off on a little tangent and went down a different kind of road, Mr. President, and that's not where I was looking to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7784.782s">But</a> with that being said, I'd ask that we <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7787.127s">several</a> amendments and move forward.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7805.261s">What</a> technology do they have to shut the matter off? <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7809.504s">To</a> shut the meters off. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=7810.405s">To</a> shut the meters off.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8542.281s">If</a> I may, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8544.39s">Michael</a> Callahan was a good friend to me and many of us behind this rail, as well as many of us in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8549.692s">He</a> was a mentor to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8550.713s">He</a> taught me more about government in the short time that I was able to know him and be around him. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8555.395s">And</a> he was a great guy who had his head on right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8558.616s">He</a> understood that government was about people, about helping people, and about making sure that it's working for you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8563.938s">He's</a> sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8564.739s">I</a> think of him every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8566.039s">And</a> I appreciate the Council indulging me as I bring this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=8569.301s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9021.562s">If</a> I may, I mean, we were here on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9025.266s">We</a> passed the resolution that was seven days ago, which was five business days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9029.97s">Councilor</a> Caraviello met them there Wednesday evening at 10 o'clock, which was in essence, really Thursday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9036.296s">So</a> that was only three business days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9038.419s">I</a> think we need to give them an ample opportunity to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9040.44s">I</a> think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9041.981s">We</a> need to put some sort of timeline in there to see if we can effectuate this change in a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9046.544s">But</a> I also want to be cognizant of the fact that it's really only been three business days that have passed since the request was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/c_1hhrksa9M&t=9053.268s">So</a> I don't know if we've gotten a refusal back from DLT saying that they're not going to do it.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3125.327s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and going back to what Councilor Penta was discussing about the federal court ruling, I believe that the federal court ruling was in response, and I'm asking him for some clarification on this, Mr. President, through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3137.131s">I</a> believe that the issue that was before the court was a city council rule precluding people from giving negative comments being deemed unconstitutional, if I'm not mistaken, based on my <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3147.433s">research</a> of the issue and understanding of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3149.174s">I</a> think it wasn't so much that people were being shut down at the microphone and not being allowed to speak, but it was that the council had a rule that said that no negative comments were allowed to be brought up at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3158.841s">I</a> think that's what the actual case was that was brought up, but I defer to the gentleman, but if it's my understanding, maybe I'm talking about a different case in 2014.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3415.344s">Mr.</a> President, I am aware that when contracted work is done in the community that they usually make a video beforehand of what it looked like and then the before and after photos are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3426.152s">If</a> it was done by a private contractor and not done by the Medford DPW, it seems like in this instance it may have been done by the DPW, but in other instances, <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3433.546s">Normally</a> we'll have a video on file and that could be accessed through the engineering office.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3471.006s">Mr.</a> President, paper 15789. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3471.926s">Back,</a> well, maybe four months ago, this council had met with the chief of police relative to a number of concerns relative to resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3482.109s">And</a> one of the discussions that the traffic commission was having was implementing a citywide permitting process for resident parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3489.472s">And</a> I'd like an update on that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3491.494s">As</a> the winter fast approaches, the parking wars begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3494.237s">And</a> you wouldn't know that today's December 15th or so based upon the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3498.762s">But</a> after our first snowfall, I think we're all going to find out about it relatively quickly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=3503.407s">So</a> I'm hoping that the Traffic Commission will be willing to provide us with an update as to where they are in terms of their deliberation on resident citywide permit parking.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4182.166s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4184.328s">Many</a> of us here in the city of Medford know the Femineau family. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4186.489s">Rose</a> was the mother of retired Medford police officer Frank Femineau, and she recently passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4192.114s">She's</a> also the grandmother of Councilor Camuso's wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/1nhdBin4gl8&t=4195.696s">And</a> I offer my condolences to the family on their loss, and I'd ask my council colleagues to do the same, Mr. President.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2063.797s">I</a> think we're really moving away from the substance of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2066.74s">You</a> know, the resolution that Councilor Caraviello filed was to discuss the positive effects that the Chevalier Auditorium has on our economic business district down in Method Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2074.446s">And</a> now it's turning into whether or not the debate's being played. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2076.648s">I</a> think it's becoming overly politicized. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2079.11s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2080.01s">We're</a> here to show our support for the Chevalier Auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2083.213s">And,</a> you know, while the resolution is coming out of the fact that we had a debate there, it was very well attended, it was recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2089.996s">I</a> think that the intent of the resolution, and the councilor can correct me if I'm wrong, was to highlight the fact that the debate was a big success. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2095.721s">It</a> brought a lot of different people to our downtown business district and was a catalyst for economic growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2100.505s">I</a> don't think it really has anything to do with whether or not the debate's going to be played on channel three or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2104.528s">I</a> think the purpose and the substance of the resolution, Mr. President, is really about the effects of economic revitalization, the effects of vibrant downtowns that the arts community and that the Chevalier Auditorium can have on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2115.097s">And</a> I'd like to see us stay a little bit more focused on that and a little bit less focused on <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2118.693s">what</a> direction we're going in terms of whether or not the debate's going to be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2122.014s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2122.774s">Is</a> it important? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2123.355s">Yeah,</a> it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2124.015s">I</a> think that that could be taken up maybe later on in the meeting during the public participation portion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2143.722s">And</a> I want to see Chevalier get funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2146.463s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2148.26s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2150.501s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2151.902s">And</a> again, I'd like to thank the folks down at the Chevallier Auditorium, the Commission, and the Friends of for putting on such a wonderful event. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2159.026s">The</a> place was immaculate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2159.947s">You</a> could eat off the floor in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2161.067s">It</a> looked great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2162.508s">I</a> think it's imperative that this council, Mr. President, amends this resolution to request that the administration take a look at putting seed money and to develop a master plan, Mr. President, a master plan to look at <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2174.766s">what</a> direction the Chevalier Auditorium is going to go, the Chevalier Theatre is going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2178.973s">And</a> the master plan, you know, will take time to put together, but I think if we can act on this now and get some seed money now to start developing a master plan, then we can make this a priority for the FY17 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2189.38s">And</a> then we might be able to get a nice line item in there, Mr. President, to start taking care of some of the capital needs that are necessary down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=2195.102s">So</a> I'd move to amend the paper, Mr. President, by requesting that we take a look at developing a master plan to govern Shivire Auditorium's future direction, what direction they're going to go in to do a capital needs assessment, and move forward in that regard.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3103.47s">I</a> just want to clarify, Mr. President, because there was some discussion about when I said master plan and when I amended the paper for a master plan, I meant the master plan for the operations of Shavire Auditorium, not a master plan for Medford Square and the library or anything else, just a master plan for Shavire Auditorium, so we can see what direction the auditorium is going to go in, and I think that we can do that with the work of the people that have been doing <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3122.59s">keeping</a> this place going for so long as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3125.091s">So,</a> you know, I certainly look forward to a subcommittee meeting on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3128.013s">I'll</a> be in attendance even though I'm not a member, Mr. President, as soon as it's called because I think this is very important and I think we need to move on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3133.816s">I</a> don't think we need to wait until 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3136.078s">If</a> we can give some seed money now to figure out exactly what it is to develop a master plan and we can start working right now on what the needs are and assessing the needs, then we can <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3143.808s">fund</a> a master plan, then we can have the engineers come in and take a look at it and figure out what it's going to cost us to actually make a long-term investment into Chevalier Auditorium so that Chevalier Auditorium's up and running, and that there's a commitment from City Hall that's going to continue to fund it, and they're going to be able to generate revenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3157.935s">I</a> think they've done a great, great job using creative ways to generate revenue that's not on the backs of the taxpayers, and it may be through renting, through organizations and groups that some people don't agree with, but, you know, I think that they've done a great job, and they've done what they have to do to keep the place alive and keep it where it is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3172.979s">So</a> with that being said, I see no need to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3175.061s">I</a> don't think we need to wait for a new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3176.702s">I</a> don't think we need to wait till January. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=3178.084s">I</a> think we can start right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4056.07s">And</a> the chair recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4058.17s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4059.511s">I</a> think that, um, one of the items, Mr. President, I'd like to add to the committee report to send to the mayor in terms of mitigation would be, um, to have a traffic study done relative to the timing of the lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4068.712s">Um,</a> because when construction projects come into the city, um, what happens is there's traffic flows disrupted. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4074.402s">And</a> when traffic flow is disrupted, the light timing doesn't necessarily line up with what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4079.004s">And</a> I think we have a problem right now with the timing of our lights anyway, so I think this project will be twofold. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4083.226s">If</a> we can get some mitigation to address some of the light timing along the stretch of the preferred route, I think that might be very helpful in the long term as well as in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4092.67s">Second,</a> and as I look at this preferred route, and we see where we cross over the Mystic River? <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4099.232s">Can</a> you tell me exactly where that is?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4131.502s">so</a> you can actually go under the river.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4142.369s">Mr.</a> Zimbra, would you be willing to also meet with the Mystic River Watershed Association to discuss this project as well as to what's going on?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4160.912s">Excellent,</a> excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4161.592s">I</a> mean, one of the things that impresses me the most here, Mr. President, is that we get this and they're ready to send it to everybody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4167.815s">And</a> it's who to call, when to call, where to call, if you have any questions, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4171.196s">And</a> I've called and they've been very responsive to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4173.838s">And</a> I have a lot of faith that they'll be very responsive to the members of the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4178.82s">However,</a> in the committee report, Mr. President, I would like to reflect that we'd like to see a traffic engineer address the light timing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4186.74s">And</a> I'd also like to see in the committee report that we have them meet with the Mystic River Watershed Association to determine if there's going to be any environmental impact of their master plan, which just got funded through the state legislature last term. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4197.615s">And</a> when I was looking at the map, I was a little confused because I thought it was going to bring us right down to <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4202.872s">You're</a> coming down South Street from Mystic, from the police station down South Street, and we have a large construction project going on right now, the renovations of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4213.121s">So</a> I think the mitigation of traffic in that area is going to be very important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4217.584s">I</a> think it's going to be vital, actually, to the quality of life of the residents that are along the roadway.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4232.317s">When</a> I excuse myself and Garmin notes, actually I did take a look at that and I saw some of the commitments that were made before that it could be phased and it could be done in certain sections and segments and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4241.685s">And</a> one of the other things that I'm also looking at is the fact that it seems as though you're pretty much on schedule at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4247.29s">Nothing's</a> changed from the last time you had all the time that you to the, to when you appear before us now in terms of timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4252.956s">which</a> is very good because, you know, as Councilor Caraviello said, certain individuals that live along this stretch have been subjected to extensive periods of time of construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4262.399s">And</a> I'd like to see, you know, that as we move, we move according to schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4267.04s">I</a> know it has to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4267.901s">It's</a> something that needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4269.881s">And,</a> you know, I can certainly appreciate the fact that you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4273.142s">I</a> can certainly appreciate the fact that you're offering an olive branch to mitigate the circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4277.844s">You</a> know, I think that this is the way that we should be doing projects and I really commend you and your office and your team <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4282.889s">for</a> coming here this evening, once again, to further update us on the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4286.652s">So</a> thank you very much, Mr. Zamparelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=4288.713s">And</a> Mr. President, I just ask that the report reflect such.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6064.013s">I</a> think that the folks from Eversource have already <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6066.482s">reiterated</a> the fact that they would be more than willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6068.863s">And</a> as such, you know, Mr. Zamparelli is the Eversource Community Relations Specialist for our municipality, and he can be reached at William.Zamparelli, Z-A-M-P-A-R-E-L-L-I, at Eversource.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6084.292s">And</a> I think many of us that are familiar with the city of Medford are very familiar with that last name, the late John Zamparelli, who represented our city with great pride, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6094.407s">contact</a> that other source would be Mr. Zamparelli, and that's how he can be reached as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6097.849s">I</a> think it's always good to get the info from the horse's mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6101.052s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6984.575s">When</a> I got an email relative to this very issue after the May 20th meeting, I placed a call to the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=6990.679s">And</a> right now, the proposed tax levy on underground utilities in the city of Medford is $73 million.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7700.255s">Just</a> a few short weeks ago this council passed a community gardens commission ordinance and created a commission and the council has an appointee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7708.821s">The</a> administration has filled their three slots and there is one vacancy that remains and that is the vacancy that the city council is to appoint, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7716.006s">So</a> I'd ask that we establish a committee of the whole meeting in short order so that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7721.737s">review</a> the applicants and create maybe some criteria or parameters as to what we expect from them as the City Council appointee and then move to fill the vacancy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7747.644s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7748.504s">Recently,</a> very recently, our Medford Police Department <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7751.446s">And</a> its patrolmen have been fitted with Narcan kits, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7754.887s">And</a> I'd like to know what the policy is in terms of when Narcan is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7758.509s">And</a> it's my understanding that they have been trained, that Strong Ambulance has donated some services to train our first responders for the use of Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=7766.712s">And</a> I'd just like to see what a copy of the policy looks like so that we can have it for our records.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8450.97s">Chair</a> recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UdTpFX1NL7M&t=8452.511s">Mr.</a> President, I'm very pleased and proud to be one of the councilors that voted in support of that project.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk/2025-03-21_bq-gVu-g8qk.html">Medford City Council - August 11, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=82.409s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much and thank you very much to the Medford High School <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=85.928s">Boys</a> Varsity Baseball team for joining us here this evening to accept this accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=90.292s">The</a> Medford High School Boys Baseball team has seen tremendous success in the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=94.115s">They're</a> two or three-time, Michael, is it three-time GBL champion now? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=98.078s">Three-time</a> GBL champion three years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=100.36s">So</a> it's my honor and privilege to ask the team to come up here and join me this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=103.543s">And</a> we're going to have Andrew Cronin, captain of the team, say a few words about the season and the coaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=116.205s">We're</a> also joined here this evening by head coach Mike Nesta, assistant coach John McGonigal, and assistant coach Erazio Azzarello. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=124.369s">Andrew</a> Cronin, ladies and gentlemen, captain of the Medford High School boys baseball team.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=792.392s">I</a> will read it now being of the full text of the amendment and recommend a brief synopsis thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=800.055s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1337.192s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1338.513s">Mr.</a> Rumley, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1339.713s">And</a> I think we also need to give a word of thanks to the members of the Medford Community Garden Volunteer Commission that were able to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1347.898s">One</a> question that I have for you, Mr. Rumley, would be the fact that we have these five total members in the alternates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1353.662s">And</a> because they're going to be appointed to serve on this commission, they would be considered city employees, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1411.28s">And</a> also, Mr. Rumley, in looking at this, I think that it's very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1417.702s">They've</a> done a great job putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1420.676s">would</a> expect that this has your stamp of approval on it, considering that you're here presenting it to us this evening in terms of legality?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1449.428s">And</a> I've witnessed them putting their backs in sweat and into the creation of the garden down on Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1455.311s">I've</a> also seen a lot of excitement relative to the McNally Park Community Gardens down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=1460.474s">Mr.</a> President, I think this is a great piece of legislation and I would move for approval as amended.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2412.751s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2415.952s">Would</a> the gentleman clarify whether or not he means the council gets one as an individual member of the council, or as a council appointee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2420.393s">Council</a> appointee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2420.914s">Council</a> appointee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=2421.494s">Thank</a> you for the clarification.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3208.912s">It</a> is my understanding that McNally Park is metered, and it's metered as part of the general park maintenance meter, not just exclusively to the community garden, but it's metered as part of hot maintenance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3220.92s">That's</a> at McNally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3221.54s">I</a> can't speak to Winthrop.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3763.524s">I'm</a> sorry, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3764.104s">No,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3765.125s">Thank</a> you for coming this evening, and thank you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3768.447s">Certainly,</a> this is the fruits of your labor and the labor of the Friends Group.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3777.492s">One</a> of the questions that I have, and it might not be appropriate for you because you are an administrator, would be, you know, we see the community gardens right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3783.454s">They're</a> bustling. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3784.054s">We</a> have a lot of growth down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3785.375s">You</a> know, you walk down Winthrop Street and you have eight feet worth of tomato plants well over my head. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3790.797s">At</a> the end of the season, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3792.528s">what's</a> going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3793.168s">Is</a> that stuff going to be left there to compost? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3795.29s">Is</a> it going to be pulled out? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3796.551s">What's</a> the direction that we're looking at in terms of when we're out of season versus when we're in season? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3801.314s">It</a> looks great when it's in bloom, but what happens when it's not in bloom?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3872.784s">I</a> think it might even be premature to ask, because at this point in time, if we establish the commission, they have the right to establish the regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3878.026s">And</a> I guess I was more concerned about what the practice is now and what's going to happen at the end of this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3882.208s">Once</a> we establish the commission, the commission has the right to set these regulations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3898.836s">I</a> think that you guys have done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3901.257s">certainly</a> circling the wagons and paying close attention to detail and thinking of, you know, a lot of issues and items that might come up that aren't necessarily something that you'd see in the day-to-day operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3912.421s">You've</a> done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=3914.241s">You've</a> done a great job, and that's why I support the ordinance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4267.483s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4269.503s">I</a> think it's very important to point out that this was a citizen driven initiative and that the text of the amendment actually wasn't written at the hand of the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4276.485s">It</a> was written at the hand of the people that are actually looking to create the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4280.706s">So</a> I think it would be important for us to support their wishes and what they see is going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4286.887s">Um,</a> you know, I certainly think it's a great ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4289.568s">I've</a> said it three or four times tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4291.618s">You</a> know, this is what the people are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4293.359s">This</a> is what they put forward to us, and this is what they're asking us to vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4296.601s">With</a> the exception of a couple of items, Mr. President, you know, I can't find a good reason to vote against it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4312.43s">Are</a> you all set, Counsel? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4313.65s">I</a> think so at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4315.371s">I</a> mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4317.462s">Like</a> I said, it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4318.663s">It's</a> something that I think we should take to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4320.724s">We've</a> all looked into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4322.545s">We've</a> all reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4323.385s">We've</a> all done our homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4324.346s">We've</a> all, you know, spoke about what amendments we'd like to see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4328.008s">I'd</a> certainly like to hear from some more people that are either in favor or against it to see where they stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4333.011s">But</a> ultimately, Mr. President, the community gardens are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4335.692s">They're</a> here already. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4336.653s">And</a> I think we need to govern them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4337.673s">We</a> need to regulate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4338.514s">And</a> we need to be sure that there's a fair, open, and transparent process for these people who want to get a plot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4343.036s">And</a> I think that this ordinance meets those goals.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4418.399s">I</a> think it's also important to point out that the ordinance was already amended by the council to reflect that there would be a council rep and a garden rep as members of the five-member commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4997.754s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=4999.315s">We</a> have two amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5000.255s">We</a> have an amendment that I put forward at the suggestion of the solicitor, which would be to exempt Riverbend Park exclusively from the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5007.019s">Then</a> we have Councilor Camuso's contradictory amendment that would exempt Riverbend Park only for a defined period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5014.023s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5285.07s">Motion</a> to waive all three readings, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5645.483s">In</a> building upon what Councilor Lungo amended, I'd also like to see a copy of the annual report sent to the people that actually hold the plot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5654.192s">I</a> think that that might be very helpful to them to see the success of a growing community garden and the success in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5659.936s">If</a> I had a plot and I was out there working every day, I'd like to get a copy of the annual report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5664.279s">So</a> maybe we can make that a part of the requirement, Mr. President, that it goes to the mayor, the council, and as well as those that are fortunate enough to be selected to have a plot. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5671.363s">Excellent.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5914.511s">If</a> I may, thank you very much for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5916.593s">This</a> is certainly something that I was happy to support last year and I was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5921.188s">get</a> a couple of nice ribbons for us here as well at the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5923.87s">And</a> I'm certainly happy to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5925.311s">And</a> I might ask that if in fact the measure does pass this evening, that we can have our ribbons displayed right here on our Rostam for first September.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=5933.536s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7244.839s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7246.22s">And</a> Miss Brady, thank you for being here this evening and sharing your story with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7249.783s">I</a> think the council needs to go a step further than what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7252.825s">We've</a> sent resolutions after resolution after resolution to the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7256.268s">We've</a> asked for the traffic commission to come in up here before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7259.655s">I</a> think that maybe we can take an opportunity to have our transportation subcommittee investigate the situation relative to the number of business permits that are being issued, the number of business permit parking spots that are available in our business districts, and report their findings back as well as proposed solutions to the council and the committee of a whole, something that we can all support, something that we can all get behind, and we'll present that to the Medford, Park Medford and the parking commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7285.107s">But</a> I think that, you know, we've, <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7287.86s">We've</a> spoke a lot about the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7290.202s">We've</a> been outspoken in certain aspects of what we don't like and we haven't effectuated much change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7295.465s">We</a> did a good job at the beginning effectuating change and it's beginning to fall on deaf ears again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7299.307s">We</a> filed a number of resolutions and we're not getting the responses that we like. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7303.23s">Why</a> don't we take ownership of the issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7304.651s">Why</a> don't we put this into our transportation subcommittee? <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7307.373s">We</a> have a subcommittee hearing where we bring the principals together and we sit down and we try to bang out a solution that's gonna really resolve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7314.61s">So,</a> Mr. President, I would amend the paper by asking that the Transportation Subcommittee meet to conduct an investigation and provide findings and solutions to the committee level relative to the issue of business parking, the number of spots that are available in our business districts, and the number of permits that are being issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7331.26s">The</a> outcome could be a recommendation to limit the number of business permits for a particular business because there aren't enough spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7337.244s">There</a> could be recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7339.192s">that</a> fall right in line with what Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7340.373s">Brady</a> requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=7341.533s">But</a> I think that we need to take a better, longer, harder look at it and come up with some solutions that will work and findings that are going to be based on fact before we move any further.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=9069.141s">Move</a> approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10004.823s">The</a> Press I'm wondering if the people who vote in favor of this project are going to get credit for addressing the environmental concerns that the residents in the North Medford section of Medford have, because this project will address environmental concerns that they have relative to sewage in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10025.272s">I</a> also think, in looking at this, that it makes financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10027.693s">And</a> I'm going to vote in favor of this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10029.753s">I'm</a> going to vote in favor of the measure as filed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10049.539s">If</a> I were going to buy a car, and I went into the dealership, and I said, I want to buy this $5,000 car. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10055.371s">And</a> they said, OK, you can buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10056.452s">And</a> I said, here's the $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10057.453s">And</a> they said, no, no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10060.335s">Don't</a> give me $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10063.457s">Give</a> me 55% of the $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10065.398s">And</a> finance that 55% of that $5,000 over five years at 0% interest, and we're right off the rest. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10073.604s">You</a> better be sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10074.905s">I'm</a> going to be the first guy in line, giving them the 55%, financing the other 45%, giving them the 45%, financing the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10085.363s">It's</a> a zero interest loan, Mr. President, over five years that we can pay it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10088.785s">I</a> know there's a contrary motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10090.366s">I</a> don't support the contrary motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10091.667s">I</a> feel as though the money should be paid back through our sewer enterprise account, which is flush, which has funds in it that are available to pay this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10098.812s">We</a> can pay it down over five years at 0% interest, and we're getting 45% of the total cost of the project reimbursed by the way of a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10107.418s">Now,</a> we can fund it another way, and that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10109.86s">But</a> what we're going to do if we fund it another way is we're <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10112.08s">reduce</a> the overall budget in our sewer account by $2.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10116.461s">We're</a> not going to get any money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10118.402s">And</a> at the end of the day, we're going to be left with less money in there than we would have had if we went by the proposal that's in front of us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10125.984s">So</a> I can certainly understand Dr. Stirella's concerns about having money in reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10130.845s">However,</a> I think we can use the monies that are in reserves to leverage further projects, because they allow us to maintain a high bond rating, and they allow us to borrow at a lower rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10140.288s">And</a> in this instance, we're borrowing at a rate <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10142.158s">It's</a> the lowest it can be, 0%, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10144.419s">So</a> I really think this is a good paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10146.121s">I</a> think that, actually, we might even have close to unanimous support behind the reel for the paper right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10152.244s">So</a> although I understand his concern to the taxpayer, I think that this makes good sense municipally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10156.847s">And</a> I think that this protects the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10158.328s">I</a> don't think it hurts the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10159.709s">And</a> I hope that Dr. Starrell is willing to share that as well in his mailing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10163.231s">But</a> I think that the residents up in North Medford deserve the fact, deserve to have this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10167.554s">It's</a> an infrastructure improvement that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10169.655s">It's</a> the plan that's in place, and the plan's not going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10171.957s">We've</a> already gone through that ordeal when we were here at the meeting last time, when we discussed whether or not the plan was going to change, what phase we were in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10178.422s">We</a> had a subcommittee meeting, and we went through that all again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10181.764s">So,</a> you know, in looking at it, the infrastructure repairs need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10184.946s">We</a> have a mechanism to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10186.107s">The</a> mechanism to fund it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10187.949s">I</a> think we should move on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10352.839s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10354.48s">In</a> looking at the paper that's before us, we have a contrary point of view from a citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=10358.384s">However,</a> I think that the council has deliberated this matter to its extent, and I think it'll be appropriate for us to move the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11358.337s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=11364.501s">Sir,</a> can you explain to me what a J.O.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12752.539s">I'm</a> going to defer to Councilor Caraviello as this paper was put on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12889.96s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12891.28s">It's</a> been brought to my attention, and it's my understanding that <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12894.757s">The</a> gas company did some construction work, and in the process of doing this construction work, they have ground up and repaved over the preexisting crosswalk at the corner of Winthrop and Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12906.464s">And</a> that crosswalk has not been repainted, and it needs to be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12911.147s">Recently,</a> we had a death. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12913.248s">A</a> resident of 190 High Street crossing the street was struck as a pedestrian crossing, and she died as a result of the injuries that she sustained in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12921.912s">accident,</a> Mr. President, so I think it's very important that we have a crosswalk in the vicinity of the corner, and I think that Councilor Mark's resolution to include yield signs there makes perfect sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12933.845s">There</a> are also a couple of handicapped spots, Mr. President, that are out in front of the building number 190 High Street that have fallen into disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12941.906s">Mainly</a> because of the amount of debris that's been on the road as a result of the construction projects that have been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12946.109s">The</a> paint for the handicapped spots is worn completely away. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12949.511s">There's</a> been an outcry from the residents in the building that are asking that this be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12953.513s">I've</a> had some preliminary conversations with the DPW and I'm very confident that it will be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12958.896s">However,</a> where the work still needs to be done, I figured it would be appropriate to continue further with the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12964.299s">As</a> such, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this matter.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12990.196s">I</a> thought we were in the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=12991.897s">We</a> did these, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13439.763s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13441.925s">These</a> four individuals have long served our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13445.007s">is</a> firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13446.327s">They've</a> done their best to keep us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13448.028s">They've</a> done their best to protect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13449.668s">And</a> because of their hard work, dedication, and commitment, they've been elevated to new positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13455.95s">These</a> four individuals have between them over 100 years of service to the Medford Fire Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13461.271s">And</a> it's with great honor and privilege that I welcome them aboard in their new role and wish them the best of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13466.012s">I</a> would hope that my council colleagues join me in doing the same.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13760.244s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13762.025s">I've</a> had a lot of talks and a lot of discussion with some residents in the area who are avid cyclists and avid pedestrians, avid walkers, and one of the things that they had <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13770.958s">expressed</a> interest in would be connecting the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden by way of the waterfront to Riverbend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13777.422s">Sounds</a> like a good idea to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13778.582s">I'd</a> like to amend the resolution to request that the department of transportation also be involved because my research would indicate that they're also going to be a party to this if in fact it does come to fruition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13789.025s">However,</a> I feel as though linking Riverbend Park to the Campbell Peace Garden will also give people another reason to come to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13795.986s">I</a> think we can build upon a vision for the square with a bike and pedestrian path, maybe bring Hubway into the square, further expand a bike and pedestrian path from the Campbell Peace Garden along <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13807.176s">the</a> Mystic River across Route 16 through Sleepy Hollow, and ultimately connected to the Minuteman Trail in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13812.96s">Should</a> we use a little bit of planning, foresight, and vision, I think we can accomplish this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bq-gVu-g8qk&t=13817.524s">So</a> I'd ask that my council colleagues support this resolution to take the small step in connecting the Campbell Peace Garden and Medford Square to Riverbend Park, and then we can take a look at the bigger picture at a later date.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno/2025-03-21_eDYkuoJMIno.html">Medford City Council - July 21, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=51.333s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=53.054s">Motion</a> to take paper 15565. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=54.115s">On</a> the motion for the hearing 15-565, public hearing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1652.743s">The</a> way that I understand this and the way that I see this presented is we have a bond order in front of us for $2.12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1660.97s">We're</a> going to get paid back 45 cents on every dollar that we invest and the bond that we're taking out on the other 55% is at 0%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1668.075s">So</a> actually, we're taking out a bond for <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1672.668s">1,</a> 2 million, we're getting paid back almost half of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1675.73s">And</a> then over a five-year period of time, we get to pay back the bond at a 0% interest rate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1680.712s">And</a> then the projects that we're working on here are to address system upgrades for our water and sewer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1687.715s">And</a> part of that includes infiltration and inflow as a phase two project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1725.848s">So</a> in essence, if we support this paper, what we can do is we can <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1730.532s">borrow</a> 2.12 million bucks, get 45% of that money back, and then pay 0% interest on the money that's remaining over a five-year period?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1741.62s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1742.721s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1743.101s">And</a> I think that you guys are doing a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1746.643s">I</a> mean, there's not too many places where you're going to get 45% back on every dollar that you invest, 45 cents on every dollar back that you invest. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1754.409s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1793.802s">Do</a> you want to continue with a point? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1795.243s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1796.944s">In</a> terms of I&I and what the studies say, what exactly is, in a dollar figure, if you can, off the top of your head, what's the city actually spend on I&I issues here in the city of Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1808.288s">I</a> mean, if we're looking at 2.5 million gallons per day, is that what I understood you say?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1828.757s">What</a> would that translate to in terms of cost on a sewer? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1831.619s">Do</a> you have any idea?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1904.566s">I</a> just want to see what exactly is this investment that we're making of about a million dollars is actually going to save the rate payers on the back end. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1910.748s">And</a> it looks like it's going to be exponential if we're losing 2.5 million gallons per day through I&I. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=1917.49s">It</a> looks like this is really an investment that's going to show us a return.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3308.721s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3309.621s">Mr.</a> President, I'm satisfied with the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3311.422s">I'd</a> ask for a move for approval on the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3747.904s">To</a> the city engineer, is it safe to say that there is a need for infrastructure improvements to a water and sewer system?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3754.768s">Is</a> it also safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3756.412s">The</a> plan that's in place right now that you're working with will be the plan that we work with going into the future?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3763.856s">Is</a> it safe to say that if the construction and repairs of the system are put off that the inflow and infiltration will actually increase and continue to increase and continue to raise our sewage rate?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3777.284s">So</a> not only will rates remain the same, they could probably potentially get worse in terms of inflow and infiltration?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3824.834s">Mr.</a> President, I don't disagree, and that's why I took out the time to sit down with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3828.899s">Miller</a> and talk to her about the project before the meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3831.85s">You</a> know I to take my responsibility very seriously and for two million bucks certainly questions I want to get answered and that's why I spoke with her about it before tonight So that I'd be in a position to intelligently speak about it and to move forward on the issue You know with that being said <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3845.478s">I</a> think it's safe to say that our water and sewer infrastructure isn't going to improve any. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3849.802s">The</a> plan's not going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3850.922s">The</a> plan that we have here is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3852.944s">The</a> question comes down to whether or not this is the way we want to fund it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3856.286s">And</a> when you look at making an investment of $2.12 million and getting back 45% of that money right off the bat, and then over a five-year period paying off the remainder at 0% interest, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3869.306s">I</a> think financially, this makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3871.027s">I</a> mean, you watch the Jordan's Furniture commercials. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3873.247s">Everybody's</a> running down there to buy a couch interest-free for five years, you know what I mean, hoping that the Red Sox hit the hole in the green monster. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3879.749s">It</a> makes sense, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3881.09s">An</a> interest-free loan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3884.011s">Why</a> take money out of the bank? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3885.051s">Why</a> take money out of our reserves when we can get an interest-free loan? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3887.972s">We</a> can use those reserves annually if we see it fit to pay down that bond or that loan at a zero percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3894.905s">But</a> ultimately, why take the money out of the bank right now and put it into one basket when we can have that money and use that to leverage other projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3902.648s">And</a> I think that's what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3903.569s">We're</a> using this money in our water sewer enterprise account and our reserves to leverage projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3907.751s">And</a> we're continuing to leverage, use this money to leverage projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3911.092s">We're</a> using this leverage to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3913.193s">Once</a> the money's gone, the leverage is gone and the work stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3916.654s">So</a> I think that, you know, in terms of municipal finance, this makes good sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=3921.817s">And</a> I support the paper as filed wholeheartedly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4013.733s">You</a> just said we were talking about it for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4015.135s">We've</a> been talking about infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4016.936s">We've</a> been talking about inflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4017.898s">We've</a> been talking about it for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4018.999s">Now</a> we have a paper in front of us that's actually going to give us results instead of rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4022.763s">It's</a> going to give us results instead of rhetoric. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4025.266s">We</a> spend the money or we don't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4026.747s">I</a> think that that's where we're at at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4028.89s">We</a> need the full votes to get the paper to pass its first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4032.961s">We</a> can debate this all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4033.922s">I</a> think we all agree that the water and sewer system needs upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4036.324s">I</a> think we all agree that the water and sewer system is deteriorating. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4039.187s">I</a> think we all agree that something needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4041.029s">The</a> question is, how are we going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4042.79s">How</a> are we going to fund it? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4044.132s">I</a> think that the paper before us is a good way to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4046.274s">That's</a> why I support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4047.455s">Other</a> individuals don't feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=4048.856s">Why</a> don't we put it to a vote?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6078.479s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank the residents from the city for coming out here this evening and telling us about their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6085.122s">I</a> think it would be incumbent upon this council to make a recommendation to our Traffic Commission, Mr. President, and based on what I'm hearing, there are several items that I'd like to add to this paper by way of amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6097.047s">If</a> the city clerk is ready, I think that we need to take a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6101.135s">Utilizing</a> the temporary speed bumps that we recently appropriated funding for through the community improvement initiative, Mr. President, along Arlington Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6107.96s">I</a> think that would be very important, and I think that would address some of the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6113.743s">I</a> also think it would be very important for our traffic commission to take a look at the feasibility of putting a stop sign at Arlington Street and Mr. Griveaux Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6121.909s">And</a> utilizing the speed boards that we have, Mr. President, by way of the police department at Willis Ave, Arlington Street, and West Street to control speeds, as well as Harvard Ave, Harvard Street, rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6136.519s">And</a> I also think that directed patrols for enforcement of violations, Mr. President, speed and truck routes along these roadways would be imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6146.644s">And</a> lastly, I think that we need to request that the Traffic Commission revisit the issue of a truck ban a long habit, because I, too, travel that road quite frequently and see four trucks back up and block the intersection, and it's a waiting game. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6159.23s">You</a> just wait for the lights to change, wait for the lights to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6161.931s">Individuals</a> can't even get out of their driveway, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6164.508s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper by requesting that the Traffic Commission take these following steps.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6622.646s">My</a> concern is that between now and when we get a transportation engineer that we went through an operating budget that we didn't fund already, and we already had this discussion just a month ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6635.964s">I'm</a> not confident that the administration is going to act and hire a transportation engineer between now and January. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6641.947s">And</a> that means that if we make the resolution, hire a transportation engineer, none of these items get taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6647.53s">We</a> still need to look at whether or not MassDOT has the ability and power and the past practice of providing transportation engineers to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6655.533s">I</a> did investigation on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6656.974s">I</a> spoke with several individuals at MassDOT today. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6660.476s">My</a> understanding is they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6662.348s">They</a> have an office that works with project managers and works with transportation planners that are working on particular projects in regions. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6669.173s">They</a> have technical assistance that they use to provide certain technical assistance to people that are working on projects in communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6675.417s">But</a> I think that there are a lot of financing questions here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6677.839s">And,</a> you know, I think that if we don't vet it properly, it's just going to be another paper that gets sent to the corner office and sits there and collects dust in the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6686.705s">But</a> if we keep the conversation alive and take ownership of it, as opposed to passing the buck across the hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6692.041s">I</a> think that we may be able to get better results. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6716.648s">We</a> want to talk about a transportation engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6718.249s">I</a> think we should be doing that through a subcommittee process, bringing the appropriate parties to the table and building the momentum that's going to make it happen, as opposed to sending a paper across the hall and letting us sit there, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6738.267s">It</a> is what it is, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6739.008s">I</a> mean, my concern is the people back here and whether or not they want these results on their streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6743.29s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6743.73s">I</a> think that this is an approach that we can take where we can effectuate change immediately is all I'm saying, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6749.833s">We</a> could have five papers if we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6751.354s">What</a> I'm saying is in January, we discussed this very same topic in the subcommittee meetings, in the budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6757.237s">It</a> wasn't included in the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6758.638s">The</a> operating budget passed last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6761.179s">Last</a> meeting was the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6762.539s">Now,</a> here we are, the meeting after the operating budget passed, saying, create a new position and add it to the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6768.142s">I'm</a> saying, okay, that sounds like a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6770.383s">Let's</a> sit down and let's figure out how we're going to do that, as opposed to saying, hey, over there, put this in the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6776.326s">This</a> is what we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6777.867s">Let's</a> figure out how we're going to do it, how we're going to fund it, what steps we need to take, where we can find funding for it, because I think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6785.795s">That's</a> why I brought it up at the budget hearings when we were having the budget hearings, because a transportation planner is a good idea, and we need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6792.298s">Number</a> one, revitalizing our downtowns, and number two, alleviating traffic in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6795.6s">There's</a> no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6797.281s">But</a> I think that in order for us to address issues of speed bumps and stop signs, that has to go to the traffic commission regardless of whether or not we have a traffic or transportation engineer on staff.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6862.545s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6863.305s">I</a> think maybe if there's anybody that has business before the body, we can take care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6867.628s">If</a> there's any, you know, I think we have a traffic license. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6869.61s">We</a> have a brief presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6871.151s">I'll</a> be happy to hold my resolutions until the end of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=6873.893s">But</a> if there are any other members of the general public that are here that want to, I know we have two taxi licenses and we also have three licenses?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7212.881s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7215.522s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7216.823s">And</a> thank you, Mr. Tudin, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7218.524s">I</a> think if we all think back to a couple of weeks ago, we saw Curtis here wearing a different hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7223.407s">It</a> was a baseball hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7224.348s">He's</a> one of our coaches at the Medford High School baseball team, GBL champs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7228.263s">And</a> one of his other functions that he does here is working on the Energy Commission, and he does great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7234.892s">Curtis,</a> I'd like to thank you for coming down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7236.814s">I</a> appreciate your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7238.697s">And</a> I'd like you to maybe tell us a little bit about the Harvester Energy Fest and how fun it is, because last year I went down there and <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7244.745s">I</a> think I bought more light bulbs than I knew what to do with by the time I got out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=7247.868s">They</a> had these energy efficient light bulbs at a great price.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8808.42s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8810.061s">About</a> 97 days ago, I believe, I put a resolution on piggybacking on Councilor Caraviello's resolution of about 180 days before that and requesting that the West Medford Commuter Rail Station be beautified in terms of deweeding and the replacement of stanchions along High Street and some other items relative to overall cleanliness and upkeep. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8832.446s">And</a> to date, we have not seen these occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8835.25s">I've</a> placed a call into the Department of Transportation requesting their assistance on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8839.471s">However,</a> I ask that my council colleagues support this agenda item in order to have an official paper passed by this body for the MBTA to act on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8868.603s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8871.184s">Over</a> recent months, I've been driving down the corridor of Riverside Avenue, and every time I drive past the Wellington Plaza, I look at it, and I look at it as a potential for great growth, a potential for us to maybe make some zoning changes there and address some of the needs that we have in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8888.553s">It's</a> a very large parcel of land right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8890.415s">It's</a> about two stories high. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8893.702s">thinking</a> I think that maybe we can go up a little bit, a couple of more stories, create some commercial space, potentially maybe some tech industry jobs or some office space that might be resulting in the knowledge-based economy, in the health sciences, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8912.126s">But</a> more importantly, I think that we also need to take a look at this opportunity to create affordable housing in our community, affordable housing that's transit-based, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8919.98s">affordable</a> housing that can help us reach our quota, because we are not there at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8924.982s">And</a> based upon our conversations that we had in our committee of the whole this morning with the issue of the Community Preservation Act, I think there is an underlying concern that the lack of affordability in terms of housing in our community is forcing people out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8939.566s">And</a> with that being said, there's a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8941.467s">And</a> I think that transit-based mixed-use development at a location like Wellington Plaza would do a number of things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8947.008s">First</a> of all, it would increase our commercial tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8949.451s">would</a> allow us to develop more businesses, which would, in turn, allow us to have a broader tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8954.996s">It</a> would also allow us to address the need of affordable housing by creating units there for people that can live with low and moderate income with access to the T, so that they have the ability to get in and out of town, to go to jobs, go to work, have more opportunities than they would have if they weren't based in a development that's further away from transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8970.631s">So,</a> Mr. President, I ask my colleagues on the council to support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8974.913s">It's</a> not the first time I've brought an item like this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8977.034s">I've</a> discussed this also at the site of, you know, Locust Street, Meadowglen Mall, and Shaw's. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=8981.995s">But</a> I think it's a good idea for us to really take a look at our zoning and to come up with a combined use model for us to really capitalize on the space that we have.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9043.944s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly agree that growth is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9045.925s">And</a> we're looking at growth here in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9048.966s">We're</a> seeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9050.106s">We're</a> seeing facade improvements go on in the retail aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9053.147s">We're</a> seeing restaurants come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9055.207s">But</a> the way I'm looking at this is a little bit broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9059.899s">commercial</a> space come in that brings us jobs that are good-paying jobs that pay $80,000, $90,000, $100,000 a year, jobs that are outside the realm of the food service industry, more in the knowledge-based economy, life sciences, and the actual future of where we see job growth in Massachusetts and in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9077.53s">So</a> I can understand that they want to build this area out, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9081.277s">and</a> they want to put chain restaurants in there, and they want to put Panera and Smashburger, and that's all well and good, and those are projects that I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9087.541s">However,</a> on a larger scale, I think if we're looking at bringing jobs to the community and we're looking at really addressing several concerns about improving our tax base, putting money back into the circular flow of our economy, and having good jobs that provide good wages with good benefits, I think we need to look at it a little differently as opposed to retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9104.852s">We</a> really need to take a look at commercial and industry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9134.236s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9135.997s">Last</a> meeting, we wrapped up our fiscal year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9138.618s">We</a> approved that budget, and it is now on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9143.54s">But</a> there was a lot of debate, a lot of question, a lot of concern about being provided with information, being provided information late, about having questions that need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9152.003s">So</a> in looking at the process as a whole, when I took a step back and said, how did this all go, I thought it might make sense for us to meet quarterly with the budget director to talk about what's going on in terms of actual expenditures out of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9164.129s">and</a> forecasted revenues that we're hoping are coming in, and then also what our needs and priorities are, and how we can better address some of the concerns that were raised through our last two proceedings, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9369.03s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9370.271s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Penta, for once again raising this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9373.093s">I</a> did a little investigating on the matter myself, and it's my understanding that a brick fell from the roof of the building as part of the parapet, I guess they call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9381.018s">And</a> that scaffolding is not up because they're doing work on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9384.56s">That</a> scaffolding is up so no one gets conked on the head by a brick is what my understanding is. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9389.381s">And</a> I think that, you know, this is probably an appropriate situation for us to look into the clean it or lean it ordinance that we have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9398.567s">However,</a> I'm going to be with Councilor Penta to run this one 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9402.37s">I</a> don't care what we do, but we got to do something to get it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9404.631s">And</a> if it's a public safety issue and it's because bricks are falling down off the top of the building, that needs to be addressed immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9410.695s">In</a> the interim, you know, I think we need to have a building department take a look at it to make sure that there are no public safety concerns that are generally <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9418.457s">endangering,</a> passes by, pedestrians and cars and vehicles alike, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9423.019s">So,</a> Councilor Penta, thank you for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9425.44s">I</a> like the approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9426.82s">You</a> know, if there's nothing on the books, let's put something on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9428.861s">If</a> there is something on the books, then tell us what it is and let's take care of it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9723.327s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9724.787s">And</a> if Councilor Marks were here, I'm sure he'd be signed onto this resolution as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9729.25s">Mr.</a> DiMeo's son and I were very close friends, his daughter, and Councilor Marks are very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9734.513s">With</a> that being said, Mr. DiMeo, <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9737.112s">passed</a> away recently, unexpectedly, after a short battle with cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9743.773s">And</a> he was actually beating his cancer back and passed away from some complications very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9749.014s">However,</a> it's my hope that this council will join me in extending its deepest and sincere condolences to the family on their loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9754.536s">Mr.</a> DiMaio was a great person, a great individual, a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9759.717s">He's</a> lived in Medford a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9761.077s">He</a> came here from Italy, settled in Medford, and has been here ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9764.578s">He's</a> been a strong member of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9767.265s">He</a> owns multiple properties in the neighborhood, and he's just an all-around great person, Mr. President, and he's going to be missed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9786.468s">Yes,</a> again, Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9788.849s">And</a> if Councilor Camuso were here this evening, he would be, I'm sure, assigned onto this resolution, as Marie's grandson, John, is very close friends with both of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9797.361s">With</a> that being said, Marie's children Giovanni and Nick still live in south Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9803.145s">Marie</a> came over here from Tripoli by way of Italy some 70 plus years ago, Mr. President, and she recently passed away after a brief illness, and she too will sadly be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9814.173s">She</a> was the stalwart of the family, the matriarch of the home, and she did a great job raising her children and her grandchildren, and she will be sadly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=9822.559s">So</a> I'd like to have the council join me in extending its deep and sincere condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10310.773s">Mr.</a> President, where the resolution before this body was to have the mayor provide us a copy of the contract if it has, in fact, been signed, and we, before us here, have a signed contract, I think that the request has been met and the paper can be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10325.32s">The</a> gentleman, I'm sure, will do his due diligence and his research and take a look at this contract, and at a later date, I'm sure, bring a paper forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10332.484s">I</a> don't know if that's the way you want to handle it, Councilor, if you want to table the paper and then bring that back to life at a later date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10816.608s">Four</a> members of the city council shall constitute a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10818.689s">A</a> committee of the whole meeting shall be postponed if a quorum is not present. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10829.272s">The</a> affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected to the council shall be necessary for the passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10836.174s">The</a> affirmative vote of the majority of the members present shall be sufficient to adjourn any meeting of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10840.495s">So</a> an affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10845.296s">shall</a> be necessary for the passage of any order, ordinance, resolution, or vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10850.078s">The</a> affirmative vote to recess is by a majority of the members that are present. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10856.88s">An</a> affirmative vote to pass any matter before this body is by a group of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10862.642s">So</a> four is the magic number on the passage of any resolution or resolve or ordinance pursuant to our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10869.144s">So</a> the motion fails. <a href="https://youtu.be/eDYkuoJMIno&t=10870.724s">Fails.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I/2025-03-21_F9Dj7AZRD7I.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 30, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=839.997s">The</a> Chair recognizes Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=842.759s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=844.539s">And</a> thank you very much for being here this evening to the folks from the DOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=847.501s">That's</a> greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=848.642s">Is</a> there going to be any disruption to <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=852.329s">boat</a> access going under the bridge from the Mystic Lakes down to the Boston Harbor during the construction phases of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=859.674s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=880.547s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=880.667s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=881.168s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=881.508s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3458.121s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3459.682s">Mr.</a> President, yes, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3463.083s">In</a> terms of the traffic mitigation plan that took place, first of all, I'm hoping that you'd be able to provide the Council with a copy of the traffic mitigation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3470.309s">And</a> secondly, is there any retiming of the lights that's going to be conducted or performed so that we can ensure the free flow of traffic through these detoured areas? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3478.773s">You</a> know, today has been pretty rough. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3480.713s">And</a> I know it's a new thing that people are going to have to get used to. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3484.275s">And</a> I think that once people realize Route 16 is closed, they're going to get off at Route 60 or they're not going to try to go the detour route. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3491.358s">But</a> in terms of retiming of the signals, is there any type of discussion or documentation that we can take a look at to see what you guys are doing in that regard?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3508.438s">But</a> in terms of Forest Street, Riverside Ave, Salem Street, because this is our center of town, this is our hub, so most of the main roads.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3525.953s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=3538.238s">I</a> rest, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5080.587s">I</a> believe Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5082.23s">In</a> the past legislative session, Representative Donato was able to secure money in the transportation bond bill for that initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5088.415s">Senator</a> Jalem was able to secure it in the House side, and the matter was non-conferenceable. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5093.119s">So</a> this council actually passed a resolution sometime back to meet with them once this construction project started to see if we can coordinate the release of these bonded funds to ensure that when the project is completed that all this work is done at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5111.258s">Yeah,</a> that's, yeah, that's all the, that's all the money that he bought at 200,000, 275,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=5114.639s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8722.227s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8724.609s">Mr.</a> Sincardi, thank you for your presentation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8728.811s">I've</a> taken a look at this article that he refers to, and one thing that the article does fail to mention is the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8733.97s">Prior</a> to the enactment of state law, we had local control. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8737.031s">We</a> had local control over the licensure of massage parlors, body work parlors and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8741.751s">And</a> that was taken away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8742.832s">It</a> was a bad bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8743.792s">It</a> was a bad bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8744.772s">And</a> I think Robert Cappucci was absolutely right when he said that we need to get our state delegation in here because I think local control is really where it's at. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8751.993s">I</a> don't think we're going to be able to beat back this problem unless we have to have all the tools in the shed to be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8761.014s">One</a> of the best tools that we have is local control, where our Board of Health actually governs the responsibility of massage parlors. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8766.738s">Now,</a> we don't have a body works ordinance in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8769.34s">That's</a> the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8770.381s">But</a> we had a massage parlor ordinance, and that was taken away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8772.983s">The</a> rights and responsibilities to enforce that were taken away from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8775.985s">And</a> I think that local control would really be the best option and the best solution, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8779.988s">So,</a> with that being said, I'd like to request that our state delegation sit down with our Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, Mr. President, and maybe come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=8787.882s">some</a> recommendations as to how we can modify or amend the state law to ensure that we can gain some local control over these issues.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9894.397s">On</a> that topic, Mr. President, I think it might make sense to figure out what strategies they're going to put in place as opposed to asking them to put strategies in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9903.302s">I</a> think we're going to get a new certified pool manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9906.27s">very</a> shortly, if we haven't already.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9908.591s">Beginning</a> tomorrow, we'll have a new CPO. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9909.951s">That's</a> correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=9910.831s">So</a> it might make sense, Mr. President, to talk to the new CPO and see exactly what type of vision they have for the pool, what type of plan they have for the pool, and see if we can make some positive suggestions to help them along.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13057.032s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13060.054s">In</a> looking at this budget and in looking at my philosophy, I think our schools are really vital to the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13066.359s">success</a> of Medford and the ongoing success of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13068.58s">And</a> this is an excellent budget for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13071.34s">You</a> know, I can go through the list like everybody else has. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13073.381s">Adjustment</a> council is a facility manager with a preventative maintenance plan and money to use, low student to teacher ratios, compliance with state mandates relative to teacher evaluations, the evolution of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13088.805s">But</a> more importantly, it's the addition of technology in our schools that was something that really excited me about the school budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13094.427s">the</a> use of Chromebooks and going digital and actually reducing the cost of materials by embracing the cost of technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13101.13s">And</a> I think that that's really something that we need to look at here in the city side as well as Medford continues to move and progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13107.613s">You</a> know, on the city side we have several new positions that have been created. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13110.655s">We've</a> put, you know, a quarter of a million bucks into the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13113.436s">We</a> have a code officer, an additional code officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13116.692s">We</a> have the Substance Abuse Outreach Coordinator that's coming on. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13119.975s">We</a> have a clerk in the veteran's office finally. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13122.157s">We've</a> added staff to the police and fire departments, full-time pre-warden as Councilor Longo said. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13127.482s">And</a> one of the other things that's very vital and very important is that capital investments at Hormel and Edgeley Field, they're actually paying off, they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13134.749s">So</a> we're generating non-tax revenues that are reoccurring, Mr. President, that are going to be able to pay for some of these capital projects that everybody keeps talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13142.023s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I was prepared to vote on this budget last week and vote for approval on this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13147.204s">And</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'm prepared to do it again this week, and I'll move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13850.292s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Cluso. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13851.313s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13852.554s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13853.995s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13854.216s">Miller,</a> if I remember correctly, I believe that when we were at our budget subcommittee hearings relative to the issue of water and sewer, it was represented that we're not meeting our forecasted projections at this point in time, isn't that correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13870.01s">You</a> don't have the final revenue numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13871.311s">And</a> do these numbers that you received today represent the final revenue numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13874.134s">No,</a> they do not, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13877.322s">because</a> they're not revenue numbers, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13878.563s">That's</a> what you have to pay, so they're not the revenue numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13881.764s">We</a> really don't know what our final revenue numbers are going to be, but we're not meeting projection at this point in time, correct?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=13887.107s">OK,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15608.089s">I'd</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15608.89s">Appreciate</a> that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15989.742s">Council</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=15990.802s">Mr.</a> Solicitor, would it make sense for us to expand or extend the moratorium until this piece of legislation goes through the planning process?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2981.949s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2982.47s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=2982.97s">Thanks</a> for your work.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3232.234s">Can</a> you tell me how many residents live down Markland Court?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3243.277s">And</a> none of the units in that facility are air-conditioned, are they?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3252.76s">This</a> is the area where they'll congregate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3255.961s">But</a> we vote there, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3258.115s">But</a> there's been some improvements there in recent years where they've done some upgrades to make the place a little bit more hospitable and livable for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3266.437s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3278.619s">We</a> were told that they do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3279.839s">I</a> do, but I'm satisfied with my questions being answered from Mr. Lorenzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3283.94s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=3285.681s">Does</a> Councilor Penta wish to be recognized?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4630.477s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4632.118s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Caraviello, for putting this resolution on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4636.239s">I</a> too thought that the facade looked beautiful refurbished, and I also like the color of the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4644.282s">And</a> I think that this, Mr. President, is a perfect example of how the Massachusetts film tax credit's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4648.925s">for</a> not only the residents of Medford and its local businesses, but also artisans in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4653.527s">You</a> know, we brought artists to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4655.367s">They</a> put up a new facade. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4656.768s">They</a> did a little bit of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4658.488s">And</a> now we have a proposal on the city council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4661.109s">So,</a> you know, I think this is a very important illustration, Mr. President, that shows how the arts and government can invest together, and good things can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4669.532s">And</a> I really think that this is a great success for Medford, seeing the film tax credit be put to work and actually seeing a movie being filmed here in Medford once again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4679.078s">With</a> that being said, I wholeheartedly support the resolution, and I would absolutely, positively think that a public hearing would be in order for us to continue to get some feedback from the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4688.763s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7193.217s">While</a> we're on to suspension, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7195.018s">Can</a> we take paper 15-337 off the table, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7198.78s">Appointment</a> of Mr. James Tarani, the Board of Trust Fund Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7202.282s">Very</a> good.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7752.406s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Lungo. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7754.087s">I</a> too feel as though Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7756.408s">Burke</a> is taking the steps that are appropriate to ensure that she is not posing a conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7763.011s">If</a> we take into consideration the election calendar, nomination papers don't even come out until May 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7768.434s">So</a> until those papers come out, she might have announced for mayor, but until those papers come out, she can't even pull them. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7773.156s">So</a> I really don't see the big issue here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7776.038s">I</a> can certainly understand where Councilor Pente is coming from, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7778.906s">A</a> lot of times the appearance of impropriety is in fact much worse than actual impropriety. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7784.409s">However,</a> in terms of the situation where the nomination paper's not even out, I have no problem with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7789.832s">Muccini-Burke</a> continuing in her position until the date that she decided to withdraw and resign. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7794.915s">So</a> with that being said, I thank the gentleman for bringing the resolution forward and for bringing the topic to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=7800.998s">However,</a> I too feel as though this is way outside the scope of what this council can do.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8677.003s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8679.045s">Um,</a> you know, Snappy Patty's is a new restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8682.207s">It's,</a> it's, uh, one of the newer shops down in West Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8686.753s">It's</a> gotten some positive reviews and I think it's certainly a nice addition to our downtown and west Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8693.038s">However,</a> not at the expense of, you know, the rules and regulations that are put in place that make sure that this community is kept safe, that health standards are met, that certain engineering standards are met. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8705.487s">And,</a> you know, there's a process that must be adhered to, Madam President, and ignorance of that process takes no excuse to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8712.812s">And</a> Councilor Camuso was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8714.854s">You</a> know, I had a neighbor that <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8716.616s">wanted</a> to put in one of those wood-burning stoves in their garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8719.679s">And</a> he said, I'm just going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8720.68s">And</a> I said, I don't think that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8721.801s">You</a> might want to talk to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8723.242s">And</a> they went to the building department, and they got all the appropriate permitting, and they got the appropriate measurements and the appropriate equipment and put it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8729.328s">Well,</a> it's inside their garage, and it goes out of the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8734.145s">Sure</a> enough, the first day they turned it on, 7,000 people in the neighborhood thought there was a house on fire, and they called the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8739.391s">And</a> because they permitted it the appropriate way, everyone was aware of what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8743.194s">And</a> I think that that's the most important thing here, Madam President, is that there's a process in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8748.52s">The</a> process is in place to keep us safe, to keep the community safe, and to protect the quality of life of the residents and the people that want to use those businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8756.047s">So,</a> you know, I think what we need to do is take a look at Councilor Camuso's resolution that he put forward, which would streamline the permitting process, because I think what this is is really it's just someone, a business owner, who's frustrated and wants the process to move faster than it really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8770.171s">And</a> because the permitting process is taking a bit of time, he's getting himself a little bit ahead of the gun. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8774.933s">You</a> know, I certainly want to portray a business-friendly attitude when people come before the council for common victuals licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8784.045s">But</a> not at the expense of public safety and not at the expense of the established rules, regulations, and ordinances that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=8789.469s">Madam</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9744.011s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9745.351s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9747.012s">And</a> I can certainly appreciate the concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9749.572s">However,</a> I believe it's important to point out that our school committee holds their own budget hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9755.973s">Anybody</a> who wants to go, can. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9757.753s">They're</a> open to the general public and we can ask those questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9760.734s">I'd</a> move to sever the questions, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9816.778s">That</a> was interesting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9818.918s">However,</a> you know, I think that the council have professed that there were certain members of the school committee that are gonna be running up the city council, and it sounds like it might be certain members of the city council that wanna be on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9827.982s">But</a> ultimately, looking at the issue, you know, we approved a budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9833.147s">We</a> approved a budget, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9834.427s">And</a> I have no problem asking questions, Mr. President, but I think that we have to ask them in the appropriate form. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9838.949s">And</a> if we're concerned about what's going on at the school department, then let's go on their turf and let's ask them what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9843.271s">I</a> don't have a problem with a joint meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9844.451s">I</a> don't have a problem with that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9846.192s">But</a> what I have a problem with is us trying to tell the school department what they need to do, us telling the school committee that this is what you need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9851.514s">They're</a> the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9852.054s">They're</a> elected to make those policy decisions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9854.749s">And</a> I feel as though we're overstepping a little bit when we're starting to demand things from them and tell them what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9859.692s">They're</a> elected into that office to vet that budget, to put that budget together and to issue that budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9863.935s">They</a> issue that budget to this council and this council looks at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9866.757s">We</a> either accept it or we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9869.479s">That's</a> the fact of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=9870.68s">So</a> to talk about the budget and to talk about what the school committee is including in their budget, I think the appropriate time to do that would be when the school committee is putting their budget together during their budget hearings.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10659.475s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10661.357s">First</a> of all, I think that the Police Patrolman's Association needs to be commended for being so receptive and willing to take these steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10668.461s">Now,</a> I've said it before and I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10670.463s">Narcan</a> is certainly something that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10673.245s">It's</a> important for our first responders to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10674.766s">It's</a> important to keep people alive who are battling with opiate abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10677.948s">However,</a> Mr. President, narcan is not going to solve the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10681.33s">And</a> if people are not provided with better access to care and better treatment options here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10687.07s">We're</a> going to see the same situation over and over again, where history is just going to continue to repeat itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10691.671s">Someone's</a> going to use, someone's going to overdose, someone's going to be administered Narcan, someone's going to survive that overdose. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10697.672s">Then</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10698.452s">The</a> system just starts all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10699.852s">The</a> cycle just starts all over again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10701.893s">So,</a> while I agree that Narcan is a very important component to an overall and comprehensive plan to battling opiate addiction here in our community, I think that one of the major focuses that we really need to make is on treatment and access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=10715.815s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11234.839s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11236.32s">And</a> Matthew, thank you again for coming up this evening and presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11239.341s">You</a> and I had a brief discussion on this last week, and I looked into it a little bit myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11244.503s">And</a> the way that I look at it is any time that we can engage a greater base of citizenry in our community to participate in government, we're doing a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11252.566s">And</a> I think this is, it makes it easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11254.846s">It</a> makes it easy for our elected officials to determine what projects people want to see happen in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11260.213s">And</a> it also allows us to get a great cross section of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11264.315s">So</a> I certainly appreciate the work that Matthew's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11267.237s">I</a> find it unfortunate that he can't get a meeting with the administration to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11271.959s">However,</a> maybe after May 14th, you can call back again and get a meeting with Louise. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11276.762s">But</a> I question whether or not the city really has the capacity to do it at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11281.024s">Like</a> you said, the ability to get the election up on the website is something that might be a struggle in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11287.206s">However,</a> it's certainly an idea that I think that's a good one, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it further with our budget director. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11293.97s">Mr.</a> President, maybe we can send this paper to the budget director for her response in terms of what her feelings are on it and where she stands on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11608.649s">I</a> believe that the Committee of the Whole that was represented that Republic was actually the body that made that recommendation to reduce the hours as opposed to the Traffic Commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11792.648s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11794.65s">Rayanne</a> Conway Forbes, assistant coach of our girls hockey team, recently lost her mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11800.394s">And</a> Rayanne's a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11802.015s">She's</a> been certainly traumatized by this loss, and her mother will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11807.418s">I</a> offer my condolences to the family, and I ask the council to join me in doing such. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=11811.461s">Great</a> family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12446.498s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12447.979s">That</a> was quite a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12449.64s">And</a> as I sit back and I look at House Bill 2847, I see that half of that stuff that <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12454.999s">was</a> just discussed will not be addressed by this piece of legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12459.142s">I'm</a> very cautiously optimistic about moving forward in support of this legislation, Mr. President, reason being that the paper was just assigned to committee recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12467.189s">No</a> committee hearing has been held. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12468.61s">And</a> if we take a look at the first item on our agenda this evening, we'll see that it came in one way but came out with six different amendments to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12474.935s">So</a> I'd be very cautious in this body's deliberations in moving forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12479.399s">I</a> think it may be in the best interest of this body to wait until the committee reports out a paper favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12484.007s">before</a> we decide to take a position one way or the other on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12486.55s">The</a> reason I say that is because we don't know what it's going to look like when it comes out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12705.872s">The</a> comp is the resolution that we're looking at, whether or not the council should support house bill 2847 or am I missing something?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12909.904s">Mr.</a> President, I find it very interesting how a resolution that starts out as talking about a piece of legislation in the House of Representatives that has yet to have been even heard by their committee would turn into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12920.096s">And</a> I really feel as though it's been laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=12922.618s">Now,</a> here we go.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g/2025-03-21_6QfAtkhSJ7g.html">Medford City Council - April 21, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=77.935s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=80.157s">Several</a> short weeks ago, I filed a resolution asking the city assessor to take a look into third-party lodging websites such as Airbnb and HomeAway. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=92.05s">The</a> assessor had reported back that the Department of Revenue does not <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=96.498s">have</a> any mechanism to define these residents as short-term lodging facilities at this point in time, and the burden falls back on the local government to establish an ordinance that would, in effect, create this type of designation for a property so that the city would be able to, number one, capture some of the revenues that are associated with these short-term rentals, but also, number two, and more importantly, ensure that these units are safe for habitation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=119.82s">So</a> I'd ask that my council colleagues support me <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=123.04s">in</a> voting for this resolution so that we can have an ordinance on the books that will allow us the opportunity to capture revenue from third party lodging websites.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=286.92s">Mr.</a> President, I just want to be clear that this isn't <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=292.007s">resolution</a> that I'm putting forward to discourage or impede the use of these third-party websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=297.97s">I</a> think that, you know, Airbnb and HomeAway provide a great alternative to hotels. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=303.212s">They're</a> also very pet-friendly, so individuals who like to travel with their pets are able to use these type of services as opposed to going to the Hyatt or the Hilton or the Marriott. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=313.017s">So,</a> you know, I want to be very clear that I want this resolution that gets authored to actually <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=320.342s">define</a> the same parameters relative to public safety and also define some parameters relative to registering the unit that they have for sale or for rent rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=331.131s">And</a> this isn't something where someone goes in and says, I want to sign a lease for 12 months and live in the unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=335.495s">It's,</a> I want to come and stay at your condo on 28 ninth street for a week and pay you $800 instead of going to a hotel downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=342.24s">So,</a> you know, I have no problem with the resolution provided the Councilor and I are on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=346.917s">I</a> certainly think we are in terms of asking the city solicitor whether or not this is something that's legal, and we're asking the treasurer, collector, and assessor to work in concert with the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=355.96s">So</a> I think we're on the same page in this regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=357.48s">I</a> just want to be very clear that this is not a resolution that I'm putting forward to impede that actual commerce, Mr. President, but rather embrace it and figure out ways that we can capture the revenue and ensure public safety.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=389.086s">Yeah,</a> that's the criteria that I would speak up when I see a criteria in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=391.847s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2244.158s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2246.5s">First</a> of all, I certainly think that <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2250.484s">This</a> program has been nothing short of a disaster since the rollout. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2254.005s">I</a> was supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2255.085s">I</a> felt as though it was something that was going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2258.206s">And</a> boy, was I wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2259.906s">The</a> rollout's been done poorly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2261.386s">There's</a> no signage, no loading zones, no striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2264.187s">And</a> there's a huge competing interest between the needs of the residents in the residential communities and the needs of the businesses in the business communities, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2273.169s">And</a> I was always a firm believer that the residents should come. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2276.57s">Residential</a> enforcement should be done first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2279.257s">I</a> think that that's really where we need to focus our efforts at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2282.198s">So</a> I'm glad to see that the police department is investing some money into the same technology the republic is using. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2289.36s">However,</a> in terms of the job the republic is doing in enforcing our business districts, I think it's come to a point now where, I mean, I think it's safe to say that Paul Revere's horse got a ticket yesterday out in front of gappy funeral home, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2303.043s">They</a> were everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2303.643s">They</a> were all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2305.264s">And</a> my major concern is, <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2308.011s">This</a> program and this plan was pitched to the council as having an objective to turn spots over and to keep all day commuters out of our business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2317.295s">And</a> there was going to be a residential component on top of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2319.636s">And</a> I think that we've certainly met the objective of keeping commuters out of our business districts all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2325.879s">But</a> I think we're also meeting an objective of keeping 50% of the people that were comfortable utilizing our business districts out of our business districts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2335.475s">You</a> know, I'm a little bit less concerned about the financial cash windfall side of this program, and I'm a little bit more concerned about the fact that the stated objective is just not being met at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2347.799s">We've</a> been very vocal and outspoken in our displeasure with certain aspects of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2353.581s">We've</a> had individuals from Republic come down and talk to us and give us nothing but lip service. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2358.622s">We've</a> realized and come to the realization that Republic's only doing what they're told. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2364.443s">The</a> Traffic Commission governs traffic policy here in the city of Medford, and the Traffic Commission needs to be before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2370.645s">And</a> I certainly share the frustration that Councilor Penter and Councilor Camuso and Councilor Marks has. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2376.926s">However,</a> I think that we do need this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2380.954s">for</a> any other reason but for to have the traffic commission explain itself as to why the program's been implemented so poorly, why it's going in the direction that it's going in, whether or not they've actually had their finger on the pulse of what's going on in the implementation and rollout of this plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2395.541s">And</a> more so, I think, one of the glaring factors that leads me to find that I think it's time that we really take a long, hard look at scrapping this plan is the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2406.325s">We've</a> continuously requested information, and we just don't get this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2409.886s">So,</a> either there's something going on that they don't want to share with us, or there's some reason why this material is being withheld from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2416.048s">We</a> want to have a good, productive meeting tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2418.169s">We</a> can't, because we don't have the information that we requested, for which we felt was going to help us to be productive, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2424.631s">So,</a> you know, at this point in time, I'd like an opportunity to hear from the Traffic Commission to see what they have to say as to why they're being so ineffective in the implementation of this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2435.47s">and</a> what the reason is for the holdups. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2437.771s">But</a> at the same time, it doesn't matter at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2441.713s">It's</a> been eight months, five months, four months, however long it's been. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2444.934s">It's</a> been far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2446.135s">And</a> the people are suffering, and the businesses are suffering. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2448.536s">So</a> Mr. President, I'm really torn at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2450.897s">I</a> think we do need an opportunity to speak with the Traffic Commission to hear what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2455.099s">But</a> that's what it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2456.5s">It's</a> only going to be say. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2457.7s">I'd</a> like to see more do and less say.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2990.608s">I'd</a> ask that you read that back, because we have been going for a little bit of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2995.949s">And</a> Mr. President, it's been amended on multiple occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=2998.27s">So</a> I'd ask if the clerk would read it back in its current form.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3013.804s">If</a> I understand this correctly, it's paper 15307 was taken off the table combined with a paper that was filed on suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=3020.189s">That</a> language has been replaced with what the clerk said.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4034.053s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4036.695s">I've</a> really tried to approach this issue with an open mind, Mr. President, because I truly believe we need residential and business district enforcement, as this was really a nonexistent aspect of our local government prior to the kiosk plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4049.877s">However,</a> at this point in time, the hardship is certainly outweighing the benefits of any type of parking management plan that's been put into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4058.024s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, you know, we have a five or six part resolution before us at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4065.53s">The</a> language is contradictory. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4066.871s">Councilor</a> Penter has made a suggestion to eliminate some of that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4071.035s">I</a> think Councilor Camuso and Councilor Marksley are both 110% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4075.363s">This</a> meeting tomorrow night is not going to solve any problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4077.985s">It's</a> not going to change or fix anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4080.126s">But</a> one thing it is going to do is it's going to give us a peace of mind and an understanding as to why these shortfalls are occurring, why this breach of contract is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4089.432s">And</a> also, I think that, you know, we're all close as a body right now to scrap this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4097.298s">I'm</a> right there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4098.498s">I</a> want an opportunity to hear from the Traffic Commission, because they haven't been before us yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4102.661s">They've</a> sent the chief up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4104.226s">as</a> their sacrificial lamb over and over and over again to express to us what their public policy is and how they're implementing it and why they're implementing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4112.129s">However,</a> I think that we're going to have a very productive session tomorrow night, regardless of the traffic and parking problems that we're going to have outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4120.032s">And</a> regardless of the fact that we haven't been provided with the information that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4124.293s">And</a> the reason I feel that way is because everybody behind this rail is very passionate about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4128.258s">And</a> I think everybody behind this rail wants to come up with a solution to the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4132.062s">Ultimately,</a> we're all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4133.544s">We're</a> all here to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4134.525s">We're</a> all here to protect the integrities of the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4136.547s">We're</a> all here to ensure that everybody has a strong quality of life, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4140.882s">And</a> right now, based on the current plan, we certainly do not have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4143.926s">We</a> certainly do not have that based on the current plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4146.469s">Because</a> the hardships that the business district is feeling and the hardships that the residents in the community are feeling are not outweighing the benefits, are outweighing, are not outweighing the benefits that we're seeing here in the pay-to-park program or the parking management program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4159.69s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, you know, I think that we're all right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4163.952s">We're</a> all right on the cusp of all being on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4167.494s">I</a> need one more meeting and I have some questions about language, but I think that Councilor Lungo was right on the ball when she said, okay, so we vote to get rid of this and we vote to return it in-house, but what's our plan going to look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4177.278s">What's</a> it look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4178.078s">What</a> do we want? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4179.459s">What</a> do we expect? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4180.7s">And</a> we've said it time and time again, and we've sent resolutions forward time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4184.381s">Maybe</a> it's time we sit down and we put together a comprehensive plan upon a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4188.663s">of</a> the contract that's in place as well as what we see in terms of our constituents calling us and expressing concern and what we see based upon the meetings that we have had here, what it is this council can live with and put a plan forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4201.447s">I</a> certainly don't think anybody wants to see these kiosks around the city anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4205.009s">I</a> certainly think they're too far apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4206.589s">I</a> certainly think the signage is a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4208.35s">I</a> certainly think that <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4209.435s">This</a> council has done a good job of confusing people as well as to what's going on because we discussed it so much because we have so many questions because, in fact, the plan was rolled out inappropriately and improperly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4220.638s">So</a> with that being said, at this point in time, I'm not comfortable with the language of the resolution or the message that the resolution sends. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4227.84s">We've</a> tabled it once or twice before. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4229.641s">We've</a> asked for the Traffic Commission to come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4231.521s">This</a> is the first opportunity that they've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4234.682s">I'm</a> right there, Mr. President, and if my <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4237.367s">The</a> responses to my questions aren't satisfactory. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4239.248s">Tomorrow</a> evening, I will join in and I will happily vote to remove these kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4242.71s">But</a> at this point in time, I think, at the very least, we should hear what they have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4247.473s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4368.735s">I</a> think that the most important amendment to that resolution was Councilor Longo's, which would authorize the evacuation, I guess, for lack of a better term, of all the tickets that were issued yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4378.841s">So</a> that would have to be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4380.602s">On</a> Monday, rather, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4381.382s">So</a> that would have to be included.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4525.54s">Was</a> it 15370 on the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4528.201s">We</a> took that paper off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4529.581s">Why</a> don't we just strike the language from that paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4531.402s">We</a> have 15370 as the number for the paper.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4534.803s">We</a> strike the language from that paper in its entirety and replace it with the language that we've discussed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4539.144s">Now</a> what I've come up with is be it resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4541.653s">The</a> kiosk be removed due to contractual breaches, parking enforcement be handled in-house, and all tickets issued on 4-2015 be vacated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4550.037s">Well,</a> that's what you have.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4628.546s">Maybe</a> the individual sit down and write something up and we can move on to another item and then come back if in fact we can have some language.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=4639.097s">Yeah,</a> we can move on to the next item on the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5120.126s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5122.387s">The</a> Financial Literacy Trust Fund is a trust fund that is governed by the State Treasurer's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5128.933s">And</a> the purpose of this trust fund is to support public and private institutions that have displayed success in advancing financial education and empowerment to certain underprivileged communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5140.676s">And</a> Mr. Belson is the sole public sector educator that's been appointed to the board, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5147.697s">So</a> I think that's a testament to his wherewithal, his experience, his knowledge, and his standing <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5152.298s">in</a> the educational community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5153.939s">And</a> when I saw this on the Internet, I wasn't too familiar with the Massachusetts Financial Literacy Trust Fund, so I did a little poking around, and it's quite a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5166.166s">The</a> treasurer of the commonwealth has the power to appoint, and she used her divine wisdom to select our superintendent of schools because he does such a great job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5176.152s">And</a> I think it's very important to highlight when people in our community do good things, because that builds social capital and it builds community. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5182.298s">and</a> make sure that the next generation of kids from Medford have that blue and white running through their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5187.339s">So</a> I'd ask my council colleagues, Mr. President, to support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5191.0s">On</a> the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5571.82s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5573.181s">And</a> Matthew, thank you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5574.763s">I've</a> spoken with Matt a little bit about this in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5577.365s">And</a> one of the things that this council spoke about was not only the rebroadcasting of these council meetings, but also live streaming of the meetings as they're going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5588.495s">And</a> I don't think that that's too much to ask as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5590.917s">So</a> I'd certainly be supportive of a resolution going forward requesting that provided the IT department can <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5598.102s">go</a> through and make sure that there are no viruses and no materials that'll corrupt our system, that this be, you know, maybe referred to Mike Ferretti for a review to see if that's something that we can do possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5610.709s">Please.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5996.916s">I</a> don't think you can put it much better than that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=5998.937s">He's</a> a gentleman who is willing, able, and ready to volunteer his time. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6002.599s">He</a> has a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6003.559s">He</a> has a template in place that we could adopt. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6005.92s">I</a> think it would make sense for our IT department and our webmaster to take a look at it to see if they can come up with any glitches or any problems that they see might corrupt our system and then move on it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=6103.475s">Moreover,</a> Mr. President, I think that Councilor Marks makes a great point, and maybe for these boards and commissions that meet during normal business hours, that the broadcast or rebroadcast could become a requirement in the near future, because I know it's very hard for me to get to 2 o'clock meetings here at City Hall when I'm engaged in my day-to-day workplace activities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7520.474s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7522.256s">In</a> correlation to Councilor Caraviello's resolution just several weeks ago, I believe this council approved a resolution unanimously that was tied to a permit for national grid to tear up Columbia Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7533.65s">And</a> we asked the city engineer, who in her public hearing documents, frequently closes with, be it understood that the contractor will have to close the street up and leave it and meet city of Medford standards, I believe is the language that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7546.556s">And</a> we've asked for a copy of what those city of Medford standards are. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7549.997s">And</a> to date, we have yet to receive them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/6QfAtkhSJ7g&t=7552.038s">So</a> I'd like to ask that the resolution be amended to include an update as to where we are on top of the city of Medford standards for public utility operators and tearing up our streets.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g/2025-03-21_Fp6eVDpxW8g.html">Medford City Council - April 14, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=798.008s">Thank</a> you very much <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=800.273s">Very</a> recently, the building department had welcomed three new employees on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=804.717s">Steve</a> Champoli handling plumbing inspection duties, Steve Randazzo handling some electrical inspection duties, both of whom were classmates of mine at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=813.725s">As</a> well as Peter Spock, who's going to be doing some code enforcement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=817.089s">So</a> I think this is a very welcome addition to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=820.952s">The</a> council's been very outspoken in its need for a code enforcement officer, and we see one that's been put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=826.547s">I'd</a> like to commend the administration for listening to the council and taking the council's advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=831.389s">And</a> I wish these three individuals the best of luck and a healthy, happy, and successful career here in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=866.869s">Again,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=868.59s">Last</a> week we had a very fruitful discussion on crosswalks and I think we may have pushed the first domino over and a number of requests will be coming in over the next coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=879.615s">But</a> I was contacted by a family down on King Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=883.657s">who</a> was very excited to see that McNally Park was going to be renovated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=887.598s">And</a> one of the number one concerns that they had was the fact that there's no crosswalk for them to walk from their home to the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=895.739s">So</a> I took a ride down Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=897.359s">And</a> I think that the first crosswalk would be at Forest Street and Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=902.3s">And</a> the next one is down in front of the old high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=905.481s">So</a> I'd like to see a crosswalk put in somewhere that's a little bit closer to the vicinity of the park so that our residents who are willing to <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=912.292s">utilize</a> this investment that we just made can get there safely, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1042.724s">Sir,</a> I want you to understand that the Medford City Council doesn't have the authority over the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1047.588s">The</a> traffic commission has the authority over the contract, and the mayor is the chief negotiating authority for the contract.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1117.432s">Yeah,</a> that's all we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1118.772s">There's</a> a methodology if someone wants to put something on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1126.075s">And</a> signing petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1128.056s">And</a> I don't think anybody here agrees with you that the plan, that disagrees with you on the fact that the plan was rolled out and it was rolled out ineffectively and that it's created quite a bit of hardship for a number of residents and businesses here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1140.994s">I</a> just want you to be aware that this council doesn't have the power or authority to change anything in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1145.595s">It</a> doesn't have the power or the authority to change anything.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1158.539s">I</a> would like to let you know that Wednesday the 22nd at 6 o'clock, I believe, 5.30, 6 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1164.827s">6</a> o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1165.287s">6</a> o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1165.827s">We're</a> having a meeting here in the chambers with the traffic commission.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1169.429s">With</a> traffic commission and representatives from the public.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1387.573s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1388.833s">Thank</a> you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1390.034s">Last</a> week we passed a resolution, and the resolution suggested that, you know, the Mayor isn't responding to resolutions in a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1397.34s">I</a> think we were all in agreement that the 10-day window is met sometimes, but rarely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1402.76s">And</a> we discussed putting on the tracking sheet the date that the resolution went forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1408.785s">And</a> that led me to take a look at the tracking sheets that we have, Mr. President, and the resolutions that have gone unanswered. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1413.73s">And</a> I think that it would be in our best interest and the best interest of the residents of the city of Medford for us to take a look at the resolutions that have gone forward that have been unanswered, sign them to subcommittee, and have the subcommittee further investigate and review the matters that were brought before this body, that were passed by this body, and that were sent to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1430.229s">Um,</a> so with that being said, Mr. President, I put this resolution forward, um, with the hopes that, um, you know, my colleagues would support the idea of us actually taking ownership of some of these issues that we sent across the hall to the mayor's office for action where there hasn't been action. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1443.532s">Um,</a> and we continuously send the same resolution saying the same thing to the same person to get the same result. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1449.293s">I</a> believe Albert Einstein was the person that said that would be the definition of insanity to do the same thing over and over again and expect that it's a different result. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1456.374s">Um,</a> so, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1457.233s">I</a> looked at this as an opportunity for us to change the way that we do business a little bit here, take ownership of some of these issues that we've sent forward to the administration, and let's roll up our sleeves and get to work and see if we can resolve some of them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1482.023s">at</a> his discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1483.224s">Into</a> the subcommittee structure that we have present, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1485.706s">And</a> then we can take a look at investigating the matter further. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1488.228s">Some</a> of these items that we sent forward that have gone, you know, without an answer may have already been resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1493.012s">They</a> might have resolved themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1494.433s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1494.673s">So,</a> you know, I think that it's just, you know, good for housekeeping.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1710.446s">Thank</a> you, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1711.407s">Council</a> Member Nye. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1712.147s">Well,</a> Mr. President, I do sometimes have concern about a resolution that starts off on the council floor that says, be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss subject X, Y, and Z. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1722.975s">And</a> before that discussion's over, the resolution turns into something that's a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1727.656s">It's</a> not a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1728.496s">It</a> becomes an action item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1729.956s">So,</a> you know, I think that we have an underutilized subcommittee structure that's in place anyway, and I've said that for a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1735.517s">And,</a> you know, I've tried to make efforts to put papers into subcommittee for further vetting and for further investigation and for further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1741.638s">But</a> the one thing that we can do in subcommittee is we can call department heads to come before the committee and explain themselves as to why this hasn't happened or that hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1748.979s">We</a> can figure out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1750.48s">We</a> can figure out the cost of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1752.486s">We</a> can figure out legally whether or not there's an impediment to the question that we've asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1757.468s">We</a> can really roll up our sleeves and dig in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1759.929s">And</a> if it's something that we want to work on, we can figure out what the problems are, why they exist, and then we can come up with a strategy to get around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1766.752s">We</a> can send it to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1767.912s">The</a> administration can look at it and say, yeah, that's something I'm going to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1771.294s">But</a> I also have all this stuff on my desk that I need to work on, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1773.955s">So</a> it's going to happen when it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1775.435s">Because</a> this is my stuff, and that's what they've sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1777.713s">And</a> I think that that's what's happening sometimes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1780.774s">You</a> know, it's obviously not an easy job to run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1782.895s">I</a> think we all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1784.195s">And</a> this body keeps the administration rather busy with our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1788.156s">And</a> I think that all the requests that we send across his desk have merit in one form or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1792.818s">However,</a> if they're not being addressed, then we need to send 14 or 15 resolutions to the administration relative to the lighting down at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1800.54s">And</a> I went on the Internet and pulled up the Condon Shell agreement, and it clearly said, at dusk till dawn is when the shell is open. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1805.733s">So</a> it would lead me to believe that because the shelves open just till dawn, they're probably not going to put lights down there until we get special approval from the DCI. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1812.335s">So</a> we sent 15 resolutions on the same subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1815.256s">I</a> pushed the internet, and they came up with a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1817.817s">So</a> I just think that it gives us another unique opportunity, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1820.798s">I'm</a> not asking to do it with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1822.098s">I'm</a> asking to do it with the resolutions that have gone forward from 2014 to date, just the resolutions from 2014 that have gone unresponded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1829.02s">And</a> let's try it out and see if we can do something different and get a better result than what we're getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1832.781s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=1834.542s">Councilor?</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2228.705s">Again,</a> Mr. President, like I said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2235.95s">Obviously,</a> week in and week out, we have the same people with the same complaints about lack of response from the administration, lack of respect from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2243.616s">I</a> looked at this as a new and creative way for us to approach the way that we do business here, to take ownership of the issues that we send forward, to actually roll up our sleeves and get to work, dig down and figure it out, what's going on, talk with the department heads, talk with the people that are there on the ground, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2255.662s">that</a> on the ground level doing this type of work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2257.803s">So</a> that's where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2259.323s">Again,</a> you know, I've been on the council now for a little bit over a year, and I haven't seen any proposal that would, you know, suggest that we change the way that we're doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2267.245s">However,</a> I've also sat here and I've listened to the same complaints week in and week out about the frustrations that people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2272.106s">I'm</a> trying to come up with a solution to a problem, a problem that I feel as though is hindering the ability of this body to move forward and to act effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2279.468s">So</a> that's why I brought the resolution forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2281.889s">I'd</a> ask for a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2283.029s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2565.189s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to withdraw the resolution as the administration's received a response from the federal government.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2596.857s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2599.022s">I</a> had the honor and privilege of working for Senator Shannon from 1999 to 2005. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2604.706s">Preceding</a> me there was Councilor Marks in his office, and I believe while I was interning in the office, Councilor Caraviello was there with me as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2612.472s">So</a> it's apparent that Senator Shannon has touched the lives of many of us here involved in government, as well as many citizens in Medford through his hard work, dedication, and diligence on Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2624.488s">The</a> morning that the senator passed away, I remember it clearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2627.59s">I</a> was walking into an event being held by the children's trust fund and senate president travolini at the time pulled me aside to make me aware of the fact that the senator passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2637.755s">I</a> was a young kid with no cell phone who wasn't able, they weren't able to get in touch with me that easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2644.879s">And,</a> you know, it was a very sad day for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2646.86s">Charlie</a> was a mentor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2647.72s">Charlie</a> was a friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2648.881s">And</a> Charlie gave me a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2650.422s">And</a> I sadly miss him, Mr. President, and I think that it's <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2654.758s">We</a> take a moment to adjourn this evening's meeting in his memory based upon the 10 years of time that's passed since he's been gone and the 20 years of dedicated service that he gave to the residents of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2667.369s">Very</a> good.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2755.225s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2756.146s">Marie</a> was a long time Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2758.446s">She</a> moved on to greener pastures down to Florida when the weather got cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2762.127s">However,</a> we recently lost her. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2764.279s">I</a> was in touch with her cousin, and he expressed some great sadness over the loss and explained to me how much he loved Medford and how much it would mean to the family if, in fact, this council did pass a resolution wishing them sympathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2775.707s">So</a> with that being said, I filed the resolution, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2778.669s">I</a> offer my condolences to the family, and I wish them the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2782.091s">Marie</a> will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fp6eVDpxW8g&t=2783.452s">On</a> that motion, all those in favor, please stand for a moment of silence.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w/2025-03-21_pkk5OxKuY6w.html">Medford City Council - April 7, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1115.523s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to come up here this evening and present the 2014-2015 Medford High School varsity girls basketball team with accommodation, recognizing their GBL championship season. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1133.119s">Girls,</a> you've made the city of Medford very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1135.26s">Keep</a> up the good work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1136.321s">They've</a> had a conversation with their coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1153.1s">We</a> could ask Coach Burke to come up here and join me in the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1164.047s">Coach</a> Burke's explained to me what a great group of individuals that he has on his team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1167.51s">They're</a> both great athletes on the basketball court, and they're also very good in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1172.193s">They're</a> young, committed, Medfordites that have blue and white in their veins that have done great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1176.356s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to read into the record the citation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1182.28s">The</a> Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to the Medford High School Girls Varsity Basketball Team in recognition of winning the Greater Boston League title and a playoff berth in the MIAA Division I North Girls Basketball Tournament for the 2014-2015 season. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1199.445s">Signed</a> by Frederick Dello Russo Jr., Council President, Adam Knight, Medford City Councilor, this day of April 7, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1207.092s">It's</a> my great pleasure to present the first citation to Sam Morin, number 55, not here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1217.176s">Gigi</a> Braga, number 44. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1218.257s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1231.762s">Sophony</a> Jakes, number 35. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1251.311s">Ashley</a> Eisner, number 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1252.331s">Abby</a> McCarthy, number 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1286.193s">Hannah</a> O'Leary, number 20, and the captain of the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1300.766s">Destiny</a> Fitzgerald, number 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1314.377s">Grace</a> Callahan, number 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1340.662s">Claire</a> Doncaster, number 11, and her co-captain, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1348.073s">She</a> comes from a great family of hockey players. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1356.797s">Rhiannon</a> Arnold, number 10.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1383.281s">I'd</a> like to take a moment to introduce Coach Burke and say a couple of words on behalf of the team.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1417.574s">I</a> think it's also important to point out, girls, that Councilor Lungo was a star on the basketball team back in the late 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1439.38s">Also</a> joining us this evening, folks, will be the Medford High School gymnastics team, the 2014-2015 GBL champions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1447.569s">I'd</a> ask Coach Fortino or Coach Small, if they're in attendance, to come join me on stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1481.133s">The</a> first recipient from the 2014-2015 GBL Championship Gymnastics Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1489.781s">The</a> citation would read, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to the Medford High School Varsity Gymnastics Team in recognition of winning the Greater Boston League Championship for the 2014-2015 season. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1501.873s">And</a> the first citation is for Camilla Hollingsworth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1522.463s">You</a> can hold the cartwheels till the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=1525.705s">The</a> next citation will go to Dominique Savoia.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3721.967s">Point</a> of personal privilege, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3725.108s">Mr.</a> McDonald came here this evening to discuss an issue on Terrance Road, and I find it unfair to have him come down here and now discuss the issue of the hospital merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3732.19s">I</a> think that Mr. McDonald might want to have an opportunity to prepare himself to come down here and speak about this to maybe get some questions in advance to have answers to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3741.314s">So,</a> you know, I certainly can understand the issue of uncertainty, and I think that nobody understands that better than Mr. McDonald, because he's very uncertain as to what's going to happen as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3752.014s">And</a> to put him on the spot right here this evening and ask him, what's going on with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3755.215s">What</a> do you think about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3756.075s">What</a> do you think about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3756.996s">When</a> there's no plan finalized, it really puts him in a bad position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3760.397s">He's</a> going to say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3761.297s">He</a> might come back three months later, and the situation's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3763.658s">And</a> then we're all going to say, you said this at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3766.519s">So</a> I think we might want to give Mr. McDonald an opportunity to prepare himself to come down and speak about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3771.601s">He's</a> always been willing to come down to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3773.241s">He's</a> never been afraid to stand up at that podium and take questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=3775.967s">for</a> hours at a time, Mr. President, but I just think that, you know, we have to extend to him the courtesy to be willing to have an opportunity to prepare if, in fact, he is going to speak at length on this type of thing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4950.27s">For</a> further clarification, Councilor Knight, I also believe that the gentleman <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=4955.817s">represented</a> the fact that they do have closed circuit surveillance cameras out there so that employees would not have to go outside if, in fact, someone was breaking the rules, jumped over the fence, that they wouldn't put themselves in danger, that they'd have an opportunity to call the law enforcement without actually having to go out there and confront individuals that may or may not be obeying the no trespassing signs or the no trespassing policy that they have in place after hours.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5649.617s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5651.759s">Just</a> a few weeks ago I had the opportunity to go to a forum at Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5656.233s">It</a> was put on by the Tufts Labor Coalition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5660.416s">And</a> at that forum, the topic of discussion was the Tufts University's reorganization plan for the janitorial service providers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5668.621s">And</a> as the forum went on, a presentation was made by the administration that would show that one-third of the janitorial staff would be eliminated based upon the reorganization plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5679.447s">So</a> there are 91 jobs or so up at Tufts University <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5683.382s">doing</a> janitorial work, and the current reorganization plan will call for the elimination of 30 of those positions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5691.988s">As</a> the forum went on, there was much discussion about the reason for the need for a reorganization, Mr. President, why the reorganization was necessary, and the reasoning that was given was that the reorganization was necessary only for the fact that they need to maintain sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5709.48s">Now,</a> Tufts University, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5713.007s">a</a> university that charges $62,000 per year plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5717.648s">They're</a> the 24th most expensive college in the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5723.59s">And</a> they're undergoing a $49 million expansion project right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5728.332s">So</a> I don't think sustainability is really an issue for Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5732.833s">One</a> of the things that was presented at this forum was the fact they're going to cut staff so that they can bring in equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5737.355s">And</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5738.833s">But</a> I think an investment in equipment and a divestment in the workforce is misguided and inappropriate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5745.517s">The</a> 30 people that are going to lose their jobs eat at our sandwich shops, they go on Main Street, they buy goods, they spend their hard-earned dollars here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5754.923s">That,</a> coupled with the fact that they're some of the lowest-paid workers at Tufts University, leads me to believe that Tufts University's plan is misguided. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5763.708s">So</a> I'm asking my council colleagues here this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5766.025s">to</a> join me in supporting this resolution, which would ask Tufts University to maintain current staffing levels upon the reorganization plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5773.968s">And</a> looking at, you know, the workforce up there, Tufts University's in the process, in a construction phase of building their campus, but at the same time, they're going to cut one-third of the workforce, Mr. President, that's responsible for keeping it clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5786.754s">I</a> think it's a misguided policy, Mr. President, and it's going to cost people their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5790.355s">These</a> people make between $13.80 and $14.60 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5795.442s">So</a> I don't think that, you know, Tufts University's historical approach and the founding principles of social justice are being taken into consideration at this point in time with this plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5806.646s">And</a> I'd ask that my colleagues on the council support me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5809.047s">We</a> have some of the affected individuals right here with us this evening who may or may not lose their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5813.188s">They</a> don't know right now because Tufts is keeping them in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5818.29s">The</a> best that they've been told is that any cuts to their job will be handled with sensitivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5823.291s">And</a> that's where we are, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5825.301s">I'm</a> asking my colleagues to join me to support this resolution so that these people here in the front row don't lose their job, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5855.429s">And</a> we actually have a Metro resident here in the audience that would like to speak on the matter, Mr. President, if the council would be so kind to indulge.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=5944.098s">That's</a> the person that came to speak on behalf of the president.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6331.449s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6333.53s">Tufts</a> University's plan's not in flux, Tufts University's plan's not static. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6338.432s">It's</a> been defined. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6339.192s">It's</a> been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6340.173s">They're</a> telling us what they're doing, and they're looking to do it in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6343.234s">So,</a> you know, these changes usually happen at commencement when there are no students around, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6347.776s">This</a> is a student-led effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6349.037s">There</a> are students in the Tufts Labour Coalition that have gotten together that have contacted me because they need support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6355.88s">They</a> need support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6356.741s">Students</a> that live in Medford, that go to Tufts University, that go to that school, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6360.185s">that</a> is standing in support of these working people, of these working people who make between $13.60 and $14.80 an hour, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6369.428s">They</a> need their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6371.288s">They</a> need their jobs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6373.009s">This</a> resolution will send a message to Tufts University that we support working men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6376.917s">That's</a> what this resolution will do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6379.098s">So,</a> well, the plan at the hospital, nobody knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6382.459s">Mr.</a> McDonald doesn't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6383.859s">Mara</a> Haley doesn't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6385.279s">Nobody</a> knows what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6386.54s">We</a> right here know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6388.08s">The</a> administration has drawn their line in the sand, and they've said what they're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6390.981s">So</a> it's not comparing apples to apples.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6462.355s">That's</a> a mischaracterization. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6464.772s">of</a> what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6466.212s">I</a> wasn't trying to prevent him from asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6467.993s">What</a> I was trying to do was keep us focused on the resolution that was at hand, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6471.473s">The</a> resolution at hand was the issues at 72 Terrace Road and Mrs. Michelle Casey and the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6475.874s">The</a> issue wasn't the hospital merger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6478.174s">That</a> door was opened, but I felt as though it was inappropriate and unprofessional for Mr. McDonald to be put on the spot here when he wasn't here to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6486.536s">He</a> came down here out of his goodwill and his own personal volition at the request of this council to address that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6492.517s">Miss</a> Casey's house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6493.743s">Nothing</a> more, nothing less. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6495.224s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6500.226s">Coupled</a> with the fact that the gentleman sat in the audience with the man for an hour before he got up to talk on the microphone, and those questions could have been asked then as well.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=6519.131s">We're</a> at the last seven meetings that he was here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7099.124s">Rubel's</a> office would be the inappropriate, uh, place to send that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7102.125s">I</a> think it might have to go to the vice president of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=7105.33s">So</a> then we'll do that to the vice president of administration.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8481.214s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8482.475s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8483.435s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8485.116s">And</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing the resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8488.357s">I</a> certainly feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8490.598s">Education</a> is a vital component to addressing the substance abuse and the opiate abuse issue here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8496.363s">And</a> maybe it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8498.265s">Maybe</a> it's other type of programming that we can put in place for self-esteem training for individuals so that they don't have the feeling that they need to go towards drugs to escape from something, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8508.214s">But</a> education is definitely a component. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8510.235s">And</a> public safety is a component, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8511.577s">There's</a> no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8512.738s">We</a> need to keep our drugs off the street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8514.94s">We</a> need to keep drugs off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8516.991s">limit</a> people's access to drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8518.732s">However,</a> I think it's important to point out that a lot of people that sell drugs actually use drugs, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8524.017s">So,</a> you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8524.977s">They're</a> not necessarily just a drug dealer, but they themselves are also addicts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8529.301s">The</a> one component that I don't hear many people talking about is the public health aspect of this and the lack of access to care, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8537.247s">So,</a> an addict that's looking for help can't find access to help, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8541.85s">So,</a> they sit there and they fight and they try to get clean and they can't get clean because they have no way to get help. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8547.087s">And</a> then they fall back into this vicious cycle and this vicious circle again, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8550.95s">So</a> I think that there are really three components that we really need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8553.732s">That's</a> the education, the public safety, and the public health aspect of this in order for us to tackle this epidemic and this problem in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8561.298s">So,</a> you know, I can't thank Councilor Longo enough for continuing this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8564.6s">I</a> think we've all been pretty vocal and pretty outspoken in terms of our position on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8570.024s">And</a> I really do look forward to the response from the school department and also the response from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8575.371s">as</a> to what direction the ordinance looks like and what direction the school department's going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8579.775s">But</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I support this resolution wholeheartedly, and I'd move for approval.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8828.952s">Mr.</a> President, Madam President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8831.053s">And</a> Councilor Camuso, thank you very much for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8835.228s">I'd</a> like to add by way of a B paper, a resolution that would ask that the Department of Transportation repair the stanchions that stand between the eastbound and westbound roadways at the railroad crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8853.492s">After</a> this winter, they took quite a beat and they were all broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8855.932s">They're</a> in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8857.372s">And</a> if I remember correctly, those stanchions were installed <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8861.68s">for</a> the purpose of improving public safety at the railroad crossing for pedestrians and vehicles alike. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8868.362s">I</a> think it's relevant to the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8871.964s">Well,</a> they all fall under the DOT now through the transportation reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=8875.885s">So</a> I'd like to amend the paper by way of a B paper asking that the DOT take appropriate steps and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority take the appropriate steps to repair the stations.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9555.022s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this resolution forward yet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9561.587s">I</a> think that, at the very least, we deserve a response on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9565.789s">When</a> I saw this resolution on the agenda, I scratched my head and I said, this sounds eerily familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9570.532s">Sounds</a> eerily familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9571.333s">I</a> think I might have heard this once or twice or three times before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9574.375s">So</a> I did a little research and a little digging, and I took a look, Madam President, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9580.093s">The</a> Condon Shell Park and Lot, I believe, is under the control and jurisdiction at one point or another by the DCI or the MDC, now the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9589.996s">And</a> if you go on the website and you look up the Mystic River Reservation, the first thing it says is that the park is open from dawn till dusk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9596.939s">And</a> the park is supposed to close when the sun goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9599.92s">So</a> that would lead me to believe that that's probably why we're not getting a response, because no one's supposed to be in there after dusk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9605.021s">But</a> regardless of whether or not <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9608.105s">We</a> have a five year service agreement with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9609.706s">Yes,</a> that is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9610.486s">So</a> we do have a service agreement with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9611.887s">So</a> there's an agreement for the city of Metro to service the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9614.608s">Um,</a> however, I think that that might be the sticking point right here is the fact that, you know, the, the parking lot supposed to be closed after dusk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9620.591s">So</a> there might not be a willingness to make an investment there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9624.233s">Um,</a> however, misguided that unwillingness is, um, I feel as though, you know, the parking lot should be lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9629.696s">People</a> should feel safe when they park there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9632.413s">I</a> just think that we really need to get to the bottom of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9634.474s">And</a> the question is why? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9636.475s">Why</a> isn't it happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9637.795s">Give</a> us an answer, at the very least, something that we can say, okay, agree with or not agree with, or something that we can come up with a plan to circumvent or to work within those confines, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9648.639s">So,</a> you know, I certainly can understand Councilor Penta's frustration, and I think that, you know, moving forward, you know, I think we should pass this resolution this evening, but moving forward, if in fact we have to bring it forward yet again, <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9659.267s">that</a> we have to get everybody in the room at the same time and say, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9663.27s">And</a> we want an answer on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9664.671s">Because</a> it's very easy to send a resolution and wait for a response, and then it gets mixed in with other responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9670.095s">But</a> at the very least, respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9672.537s">And</a> we haven't gotten that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9673.558s">So</a> I think that everybody behind this rail's had it up to here in terms of not getting a response on this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9679.382s">So</a> with that being said, Madam President, I'm in whole support of the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9684.266s">And</a> I think we can go a step further maybe if this isn't resolved within the requisite 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=9689.78s">to</a> bring officials from the administration and the DCI down here to tell us why, what's going on, what's it going to cost, and what we can do to make it happen.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw/2025-03-21_zcjjYHT3OQw.html">Medford City Council - March 24, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=359.329s">Mr.</a> President, Mr. President, please forgive my ignorance, but... The only purpose of the money would be to purchase... By right, it's allowed to have the operation of Keno2Go, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=367.836s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=368.777s">However,</a> by right, it's not an effective operation of the Keno2Go Act that would allow them to also have a TV screen to display the winning numbers that are coming out at that point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=378.505s">Is</a> that all I'm understanding?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=573.454s">I'd</a> ask that the matter be tabled, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=575.115s">This</a> evening we had a license committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=576.976s">UnityCab</a> was invited to attend the meeting because we have a number of items that we want to go over relative to our ordinance, and UnityCab failed to attend this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=584.581s">Now</a> they're here before this council requesting a transfer of a license. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=587.983s">I</a> think that at the very least we should have our opportunity to discuss with UnityCab what our issues and concerns are prior to us actually authorizing this transfer.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=695.906s">Thank</a> you for your patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=696.607s">Mr.</a> President, if I may, I certainly have no objection to the transfer of the license after the gentleman does appear before the subcommittee and addresses the questions that we have for him.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=820.267s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=820.487s">Yes,</a> I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=820.787s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1016.739s">On</a> that point, Mr. President, I do believe that the folks from Wendy's were before this council a couple of months ago requesting some sign variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1025.664s">And</a> the discussion of lights came up at that point in time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1028.786s">And</a> I don't believe the council has received any type of response from the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1033.029s">So</a> I think that that would be certainly a nice good faith effort on their behalf, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1048.088s">I</a> believe when you were here for the variance on the signage and we made the same exact recommendations and requests and we haven't gotten a response.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1279.698s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly have no problem supporting this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1282.76s">However,</a> several months back we had requested from the city engineer <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1286.263s">that</a> she forwarded forward to us her policy relative to the city of Medford's regulations and standards for the street restoration and debris removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1293.631s">To</a> date, I don't believe we've received that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1295.753s">So</a> I'd like to amend the paper by requesting that the city engineer once again send this materials to the Medford City Council for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=1302.42s">Thank</a> you, Councilor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2105.991s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2107.672s">As</a> I look through the packet, I see a letter dated January 6, 2015, from Diane McLeod to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2114.176s">And</a> the letter reads, reviewing the outdoor seating specifications provided for Wendy's, I note that they do have three tables, one of which is accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2121.541s">Other</a> than that, they provide no information on accessible seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2124.563s">What</a> is provided is not accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2126.204s">No</a> path of travel with distance or access aisles with height or knee depth, as well as no seating policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2131.467s">More</a> detailed information is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2133.768s">That</a> letter was followed up <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2135.918s">by</a> a letter which looks like it's dated January 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2140.882s">And</a> it says, in response to the memo dated January 6th, 2015 from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2144.825s">Diane</a> McLeod, ADA coordinator, Bowler Engineering is submitting the following supplemental information on behalf of Wendy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2151.371s">Patio</a> table cut sheet by Recycle Design depicting compliance with ADA, patio accessibility sketch, and Wendy's restaurants accessible seating policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2159.928s">After</a> that, Mr. Clerk, there's no correspondence from the Office of Disability to your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2163.851s">Have</a> you had any discussions with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2165.613s">McLeod</a> to determine whether or not, in fact, the seating policy is in compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2168.735s">MR.</a> MCLEOD.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2207.722s">No,</a> that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2211.765s">I</a> just wanted to be sure that... Thank you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2213.966s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2505.063s">Mr.</a> President, that's an interesting position that Councilor Marks has taken, and I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2511.107s">You</a> know, we have Wendy's here, and I don't see any harm in maybe Wendy's putting out some temporary seating and us approving maybe a 30-day or a 60-day or a 90-day license for them to use temporary seating and see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2523.535s">Then</a> they can come back to the council if, in fact, things have worked out and we can approve the design of the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2529.546s">the</a> standard equipment that's going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2531.428s">But</a> I think if we let them have an opportunity to give it a dry run or a trial run and see what the effect is, maybe that'll be a good compromise for all of us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2539.896s">I</a> think that we have some concerns about the permanency of the seating that's going to be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2546.062s">We</a> also have some concerns about whether or not there are going to be transients there late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2550.387s">It's</a> on Wendy's, obviously, to monitor their property, and I certainly don't want to turn this into <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2554.811s">you</a> know, private detail for the police department to have to come down and keep monitoring Wendy's and what's going on, and I certainly don't want to see the quality of life of the residents in the area be hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2565.059s">However,</a> I think that there's room for compromise here, Mr. President, and I think there's some room for some outside-of-the-box thinking, and if maybe we allow Wendy's to do a three-month trial period with seating that's not permanently fixed, and then they can come back to the council after that period of time, and we can take a look at the complaints that were registered by the police department, we can take a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2584.359s">the</a> calls that have been made to our first responders, maybe we'll have a better understanding as to what exactly is going on down there after hours.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2838.844s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=2839.425s">My</a> question, Mr. President, is are we granting the license on these contingencies, or are we...
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3137.451s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's also important to point out that nothing precludes <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3140.897s">Wendy's</a> from coming back and petitioning the council to lift the restrictions at a later date, provided that there are no problems.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3206.458s">So,</a> the public hearing, having previously been... Mr. President, I move that the public hearing notice be waived based on the issue that you've already read at once and to the record.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3234.791s">That's</a> what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3235.371s">Just</a> waive the reading, not the actual public hearing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3265.801s">Can't</a> we just do it right now?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3269.482s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3270.203s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3270.623s">The</a> public hearing's already been held. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3272.044s">We</a> voted on a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3272.884s">We're</a> moving for reconsideration on the paper, not on the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3275.245s">The</a> public hearing's already been held. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3276.806s">This</a> legislative body's making a reconsideration on a piece of legislation that it had passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=3280.928s">It's</a> not
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4657.762s">I</a> was wondering if the petitioners could tell me if they plan on having any music, televisions, entertainment, or anything like that out on the deck.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4672.464s">Move</a> for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4729.484s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4731.424s">Wednesday</a> the 18th we had a Rules Committee meeting at 4.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4734.365s">in</a> Room 207. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4736.057s">to</a> discuss papers in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4737.958s">One</a> of the papers that was in committee was for the council to review the cost of a copy of a meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4746.401s">Presently,</a> there was a policy put in place where the cost of a copy of a tape was $20, and that $20 was based upon the time when it took somebody however long the meeting was to sit there in front of a VCR and actually copy it on VHS, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4761.597s">Under</a> the deliberations in the subcommittee meeting, we reported out favorably a recommendation that the council meetings from zero to six months be $5 for a copy, and council meetings for anything over six months be $10 for a copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4780.374s">We've</a> also discussed, Mr. President, the council's ongoing position of support in putting the council meetings on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4786.718s">So</a> those are the two items that were submitted, discussed in committee, that were reported out favorably, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4810.215s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4810.475s">Yeah,</a> we're not creating a new policy council. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=4812.756s">What</a> we're doing is just changing the fee schedule for the existing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5031.825s">I</a> know that this committee of the whole meeting was the first of many discussions that we are going to have relative to the issue of opiate abuse here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5048.933s">I</a> think we've made great strides and this is certainly a good start. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5055.385s">At</a> the close of the Committee of the Whole meeting on the 18th, we also voted that we would meet again in a period not to exceed 30 days.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5206.55s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5207.891s">And</a> Councilor Camuso, I think that that's a great act and a great approach to take in terms of shaping this ordinance to something that's going to work here for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5217.014s">In</a> reviewing the language and looking at the language, it says, be it resolved that the city solicit a draft an ordinance for Medford to hire a part-time substance abuse prevention coordinator working a minimum of 24 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5226.937s">I</a> think we don't even need to put in the part-time, full-time, or anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5231.619s">I</a> think what we really need to do is take a look at saying a substance abuse prevention coordinator <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5235.374s">koordinator</a> working no less than 40 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5239.277s">If</a> in fact we wanted to be a full-time position, someone that's going to actually be here and there, it's going to be outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5245.263s">It's</a> going to be framed right there in the ordinance that their hours of work or what's expected of them is that they put in 40 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5251.668s">Full-time,</a> part-time, I think that those are items that would have to be defined early on in the ordinance as we start moving along. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5259.418s">I</a> think we can all agree that, you know, people work a 40-hour work week, so if we wanted a full-time position, we could just put in there they work no less than 40 hours, and that might be, you know, some cleaner language in terms of what it is we want to accomplish.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5277.749s">Again,</a> that's for discussion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5279.31s">I</a> don't want to go amend the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5280.631s">Councilor</a> Camuso has put a number of hours and time and effort into this, so, you know, I don't want to do anything contrary to what his efforts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=5287.782s">However,</a> that would be a suggestion that I would make at this point in time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6601.905s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and I'd like to thank Councilor Penta for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6607.569s">I</a> certainly support the resolution in theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6609.27s">I</a> have some concerns about the language, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6613.052s">In</a> looking at the language of the resolution, I mean, I think that everybody here is in agreement that we don't want to see a 10-year contract with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6619.852s">and</a> the mayor has the authority as our chief negotiator to enter into a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6624.015s">By</a> law, we've all been advised, informed, you know, told by the city solicitor that the longest term of a contract should be three years unless special approval is given. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6636.803s">In</a> looking at the resolution, you know, I think that it might make sense for us to go on record advising the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to sign any agreement in excess of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6647.922s">And</a> the reason I say that, Mr. President, is because, you know, even if Comcast was providing new methods and new technologies and competitive rates, I still don't think that we'd support a 10-year contract for the provision of Comcast cable services. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6664.248s">You</a> know, when looking at this resolution, again, I support it in theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6667.529s">I</a> think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6669.61s">I</a> just hopefully think that some suggestions to accomplish what we're trying to get to are necessary, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6678.214s">And</a> looking at it, be it resolved the Medford City Council will go on record advising the mayor on behalf of Comcast subscribers not to enter into any agreement in excess of a three-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6688.44s">Would</a> be enough for us to get our point across his desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6691.942s">And</a> I'm open to obviously discussing amending the paper with the sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6698.125s">Again,</a> like I said, in essence, I'm in support of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=6700.847s">However,</a> I think that some language changes might make it a little bit more strong.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7620.649s">Um,</a> Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7622.483s">I'd</a> like to thank the council for coming up with some new language. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7624.864s">That's</a> language that I can certainly support. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7626.604s">I</a> appreciate his efforts and it's a pleasure to work alongside him on this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7809.625s">I</a> believe inviting someone to Comcast to appear before the council to discuss the ongoing contract negotiations would be a little bit outside the scope of actual good faith contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7820.41s">The</a> mayor has his position, Comcast has their position, and they're in negotiations trying to hammer out an agreement for them to come to the council <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7827.867s">I</a> think would probably set back negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7830.688s">Having</a> negotiated a number of contracts in the past, during my time with the union, most of the negotiating committees keep everything confidential until the parties enter into an agreement, then they report that information out, and that information gets reported out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7872.186s">I'm</a> certainly not. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7873.965s">opposed</a> to a public hearing on the issue to discuss the concerns that residents have about their Comcast cable subscription. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7880.41s">However,</a> even if you look at the open meeting law, the open meeting law says a perfect scenario for executive session would be when, in fact, it would be detrimental to contract negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7889.617s">So</a> I think that, you know, based on past practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=7891.678s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8986.953s">Mr.</a> President, I believe last week we did vote by way of resolution to invite the Traffic Commission here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=8993.387s">The</a> traffic commission is the body that's responsible for the oversight, the implementation of the parking program, but more importantly, they're the policy makers. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9000.751s">They're</a> the ones that set the policy, set the ordinance and the tone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9005.293s">Republic's</a> tasked with the job of enforcing our ordinance, and they're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9009.556s">I</a> think that it's incumbent upon us and the administration to sit down and point out where the failings are, and then take corrective action. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9020.571s">Councilor</a> Penta is absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9022.013s">The</a> contract is not being adhered to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9023.794s">There</a> are violations in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9026.036s">I</a> think that, you know, Councilor Caraviello's idea is a good one to bring them here in the next 14 days or the next 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9031.5s">I'd</a> suggest that we say 30 days, Mr. President, for the simple fact that maybe we can meet as a council and come up with our laundry list or our punch list of things that are driving us crazy about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9041.229s">It's</a> not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9042.87s">The</a> violations of the contract are not being adhered to. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9045.685s">So</a> on and so forth, get this list together and give them an opportunity to remediate the problems that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9050.086s">I</a> mean, I don't think 30 days, we've already given them two months for a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9054.487s">I</a> think that the review that's coming back from this council and members of the general public are not glaring.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9076.183s">And</a> that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9077.064s">I'm</a> saying let's get the list together. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9078.224s">Let's</a> give it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9078.765s">Let's</a> give them 30 days to fix it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9082.047s">If</a> they don't fix it within 30, they don't fix it within 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9084.008s">Then</a> we can take our vote on whether or not we want the contract eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9086.549s">But</a> I think that we've made a lot of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9089.051s">We've</a> made a lot of progress and a lot of discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9099.723s">It's</a> a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9100.563s">And</a> I don't disagree with you, Councilor, and quite frankly, I find it kind of asinine to be giving people parking tickets when there are no signs that are out there that say where you can park and where you can't park, and that the signs are inaccurate, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9111.606s">And</a> I think that these are real-life issues, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9115.386s">So</a> I think that, you know, at the end of the day, is the contract going to be eliminated by the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9119.967s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9120.847s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9121.168s">But</a> if it isn't, if it isn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9124.434s">Then</a> what? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=9125.015s">We're</a> still left with the same project and the same program, and we still need to have these changes take place in order for it to work appropriately.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11314.436s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11315.897s">I</a> too feel as though it's premature to take a vote to opt out of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11320.732s">I</a> think that, you know, we have a very divided council right now, but it's a council that's willing to take a look at the direction that our traffic commission is going in and try to work towards putting some resolutions and resolves in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11335.162s">With</a> that being said, you know, last week we did pass a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11338.484s">We</a> asked the traffic commission to come and appear before us with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11342.146s">My</a> council colleague, Councilor Caraviello, referred to a response that we received in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11346.409s">However,</a> that response wasn't to the paper that we just passed last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11350.271s">So</a> I think that, you know, we're going down one course and one train, and we're saying, come on down, let's talk about this, let's figure out what's going on, and let's come up with some sort of plan that can work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11359.777s">And</a> now, a week later, we're saying, forget about it, let's eliminate the plan in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11364.239s">I</a> think we're sending mixed signals and mixed messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11367.681s">I</a> certainly like the solution that Councilor Marks had. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11370.383s">I</a> thought that was an out-of-the-box way of looking at the situation, and I think that that's where the problem lies. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11374.946s">I</a> think the problem really does lie with over-aggressive enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11377.911s">and</a> then, you know, a very reasonable traffic commission that's willing to address some of those issues that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11384.973s">So</a> we have aggressive enforcement with a reasonable traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11388.034s">Maybe</a> the enforcement arm is the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11391.335s">So,</a> you know, I think that this item needs a little bit more time to be hashed out, a little bit more time to be vetted properly, Mr. President, before I'm ready to take a vote to say that the program should be eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11401.858s">As</a> being said, Mr. President, I'd move on the question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11952.651s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11954.773s">This</a> morning I had the opportunity to speak with our highway superintendent relative to this very issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11959.455s">And</a> I asked exactly how far $143,000 would get him. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11964.224s">And</a> a highway superintendent said that this $143,000 will be very, very helpful to the city of Medford to restore our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11972.632s">In</a> the conversation, you know, we continued to talk about the program and what direction the city was going to go in, whether or not they were going to participate and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11981.4s">And</a> one of the things that came up in discussion was the fact that if we're going to get $143,000 in money, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11988.242s">And</a> it's for the purposes of repairing our roadways, what's the best way to use it? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11992.086s">Would</a> it be the best use to take that and put cold patch down so that we can get through the rest of the winter, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=11997.351s">Or</a> would it be the best use of that money to wait until the winter's over to grind streets down, right back down to the bone and build them back up the way that they should be built? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12006.903s">Much</a> to my happiness, Mr. President, they're going to be doing a bit of both, from what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12012.605s">There'll</a> be some sections of High Street that are going to get ground down all the way in the near future, and there's also going to be some patchwork that's being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12019.207s">So</a> I certainly commend the work of our DPW to take this twofold approach, Mr. President, to grinding the streets down, but also repairing some of the patchwork that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12029.25s">With</a> that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12030.781s">You</a> know, I think this is a great initiative, a great project, and I commend the highway superintendent for being in front of the issue as opposed to behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12037.142s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12581.281s">Well,</a> what happened was, Mr. President, I got a set of minutes and the set of minutes was incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12585.182s">Then</a> there were going to be some corrections that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12587.743s">I</a> got another set of minutes that came out that had corrections in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12590.724s">So</a> before I could bring the corrections up at the Council meeting on the initial minutes, we got a new set of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12596.606s">I</a> got those new set of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12597.707s">I</a> looked at those new set of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12598.907s">I've</a> gone through those new set of minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12600.628s">I've</a> made one change, Mr. President, and it comes under the first item on the GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12605.129s">And</a> Councilor Penter and I having a little bit of a <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12608.612s">disagreement</a> as to what it should read. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12610.453s">What</a> the president read into the record was, Councilor Penta asks that the record reflect he also spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12618.977s">Councilor</a> Penta would like the language to read that Councilor Penta did not speak as a city councilor, but as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12644.917s">What</a> was written to the record by the President is what I'm going to go with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12647.86s">I've</a> gone over this thing three or four or five times, so.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12652.004s">As</a> do I, because, you know, my name's on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12654.166s">That's</a> why I gave it such scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12655.327s">I</a> wasn't going to move for approval if I feel as though it wasn't an accurate reflection of what happened at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12660.171s">You</a> know, so I'd move for approval as amended, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12675.918s">We</a> just said that, you know, I was under the impression that if someone was going to be behind the rail and they were going to speak, but not as a city council, but as an average citizen or a member of an organization, they would get up and they would address the council from the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12685.964s">That</a> didn't happen, which started leading me to have all these concerns saying, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12690.586s">Why</a> is it happening here? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12691.407s">And</a> then I watched the tape and it says he was also a member of the MMA as opposed to exclusively speaking as a member of the MMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12697.963s">So,</a> I went with what the president said because of the fact that, you know, parliamentary procedure would do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12702.485s">Which</a> president? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12703.845s">You.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12704.886s">What</a> did I say? <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12706.986s">Councilor</a> Penta asked that the record also reflect that he spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12712.988s">And</a> I may have said something to the effect of so noted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12741.117s">There</a> was action on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12742.138s">There</a> was action on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12744.219s">It</a> was a letter sent, I believe, to the administration and to the legislature.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12840.353s">–</a> What should the record reflect, and should it reflect whether or not what the president read into the record, or what was <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12845.57s">Mentioned</a> during a speech when the gentleman wasn't speaking as a city councilor, apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12849.476s">I</a> mean, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12850.818s">I'm</a> deferring to the language that the president referred to when he read it into the record.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12862.156s">Well,</a> like I said, Mr. President, my name's on it and I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12864.677s">I</a> want it to be an accurate reflection just because. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12866.778s">Motion</a> for approval by Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12872.02s">I</a> have. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12872.22s">That's</a> what I've come up with.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12949.091s">I</a> read the references saying that Councilor Pender wanted to also be recorded as being a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=12996.049s">The</a> email I have in front of me reads, under paper number 15053, the vote was taken and the president noted, Councilor Penta would like the record to reflect that he also spoke as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=13007.038s">The</a> minutes should reflect that, hyphen. <a href="https://youtu.be/zcjjYHT3OQw&t=13009.2s">Councilor</a> Penta spoke also as a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA/2025-03-21_bmoMuW8NubA.html">Medford City Council - March 17, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=443.144s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=444.665s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=445.565s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso, for filing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=448.888s">I</a> always think it's a good idea when it's time to put your money where your mouth is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=453.294s">And</a> I think this is a perfect example of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=456.057s">If</a> we are going to take the issue of addiction in our community seriously, I think we need to dedicate a revenue stream to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=463.584s">Mr.</a> President, we've had a lot of discussions over the past couple of weeks about putting a line item in the budget, about inviting certain individuals down here to provide us with their expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=473.574s">And</a> I think this is a great start to the discussion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=476.52s">I</a> think right now we have the unique opportunity because we have certain services that are lacking to really tailor programming to figure out what's exactly going to work in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=487.487s">Not</a> what's going to work next door across the street or up on Beacon Hill, but what's going to work here for Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=492.57s">I</a> too would support further discussion of this matter in the subcommittee process. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=497.118s">However,</a> I feel as though it's a great idea, and as soon as we shape this thing to reflect what our wants, needs, and desires are here in the city of Medford, and what exactly it is going to take to assist those that are struggling, you know, I'll be supporting this wholeheartedly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=511.205s">I</a> think it's a great idea, and I commend Councilor Camuso for putting his money where his mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=515.547s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=988.918s">Mr.</a> President, if I may be so bold to ask, several weeks back, we did request some information from our first responders here in the community, providing us with some data relative to the number of overdoses that have occurred in 2013, 2014, and year to date, related to opiates. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1006.286s">And</a> I haven't seen any of that come across my desk yet, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1009.667s">I</a> was wondering if you might have seen it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1045.173s">I</a> just, it's my understanding that the EMTs and Armstrong Ambulance do carry the NACA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1050.594s">But</a> in terms of public safety officials at this point in time, I don't believe they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1054.695s">I</a> believe they're in ongoing contract negotiations and discussions thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1057.475s">But</a> that can be clarified. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1058.995s">But</a> as far as Armstrong Ambulance, I'm certain that they are carrying NACA. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1064.156s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1064.536s">So</a> Mr. Clerk, would you like to roll?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1304.557s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1306.7s">This</a> is a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1308.201s">I'm</a> reading it, and I think that it could work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1309.959s">both</a> ways I think inversely we could pair adults with youngsters who are willing to give back to the community to assist those maybe that are widowed at home that have problems maybe with some home repair, shoveling, mowing the lawn, that type of stuff, or other activities of daily living, Mr. President, whether it's helping pay the bills, that type of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1328.142s">I</a> do have a concern that if in fact the city does institute a program that it might take away from some of the non-profit organizations in the community that are already doing this kind of work, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1337.484s">So</a> I'd ask that you know if in fact the mayor was going to put together a mentoring program that he'd draw the people in <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1342.892s">to</a> his office right now for some advice, for some direction, for some deliberation as to what works, what doesn't work, and what we can do to pool our efforts together to ensure that the program would touch as many lives as it possibly can. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1357.319s">If</a> the Kiwanis have their Builders Club and it's, you know, working to make a mentoring program, pairing individuals, children with adults to mentor, we don't want to break that bond and we don't want to set back the good work that that club has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1371.775s">So</a> I'd ask that if the administration were in fact going to take this suggestion seriously, that they brought all the stakeholders to the table, Mr. President, to talk about best practices and to figure out ways that we're not pulling away from each other.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1667.34s">Councilor</a> Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1668.921s">Mr.</a> President, tomorrow there will be a Rules Committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1672.904s">And</a> I don't want to be so bold as to suggest that Councilor Marks may be willing to put a B paper forward and refer that to the Rules Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1680.13s">And</a> we can get the ball rolling on the mentoring program right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1683.413s">And</a> we're meeting tomorrow at 4.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1687.27s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1691.792s">Well,</a> no, I mean, we can set up the parameters. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1693.173s">We</a> can set up the parameters of the program in the rules committee, report it out to the committee of the whole for a vote, and then we can, we can start it up before this legislative session is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=1701.636s">Great.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2609.64s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2611.901s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper with the B paper, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=2614.802s">And</a> the B paper would read that the Mayor and the City Council President work together to appoint a member of the City Council to be a member of the negotiating team in the upcoming contract renewals.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4540.273s">Mr.</a> President, I think that Councilor Camuso's revised amendment to the paper is the right course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4547.495s">I</a> didn't feel too comfortable moving forward without first having an opportunity to review the initial and original vote that authorized the mayor to enter into a contract with a cable service provider for a period of time over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4558.489s">And</a> getting the city solicitor's opinion is also something that I would have liked to have in my hand before I actually made a vote as to whether or not we would allow the mayor to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4568.071s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think that after the debate and the deliberation that we've had here at this point in time, we have a paper that we can all support and I'd like to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4577.013s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4668.093s">Can</a> we do one roll call vote on the whole paper?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4723.669s">On</a> the motion, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4725.21s">I</a> wouldn't have voted to put the papers together. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4726.97s">We're</a> going to continue to debate on the topic, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4730.892s">You</a> don't want to debate the topic.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4759.109s">Of</a> the vote to put all the papers, to unite the papers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4761.43s">I</a> voted to unite the papers because I felt as though we had an agreement here amongst the members of this council that this is something that we can all support. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4768.232s">As</a> such, if we're all going to support it, we can stop debate and we can support the measure and we can move forward on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4772.914s">If</a> in fact, we're going to merge all the papers together and then continue debate on it and then start adding to it again, I have concerns about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4778.776s">I'd</a> like to keep my paper separate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4795.314s">I'm</a> not out after you at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4796.975s">What</a> I want to do is I want to preserve my paper, and I don't know what's going to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4799.855s">I</a> don't know what's going to come up.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=4868.49s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5573.811s">I'm</a> just hoping that the Councilor can share with us the address and the location of Medford Pediatrics.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5582.595s">Okay,</a> that's Mystic Valley Pediatrics.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5923.561s">Mr.</a> President, I think bringing Republic here is all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5926.704s">However,</a> Republic's job in the function that they're tasked with <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5930.945s">is</a> to enforce the existing city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5933.846s">And</a> I think that the scope and purview and directive that they're receiving is coming from the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5939.168s">So</a> we can bring Republic here all we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5941.829s">Republic's</a> still gonna do what they're gonna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5943.41s">The</a> Traffic Commission is the body that has the oversight and the control and the ability to direct them to do certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5948.612s">So</a> I think that if we're gonna do anything, we should bring the Traffic Commission here because the Traffic Commission is the policymaking arm that's in charge of this parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5954.715s">They're</a> the policymaking arm that makes these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5956.695s">They're</a> the policymaking arm that's reduced the parking hours from seven to seven <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5961.457s">8</a> to 6, so they're the ones that can effectuate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5964.28s">So</a> I think that those are the people that really need to be here, Mr. President, would be the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=5967.762s">So</a> the Traffic Commission is invited.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6334.792s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6335.913s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6337.793s">Recent</a> conversation with athletic director Bobby Maloney who was very, very proud of the work of the 2014-2015 GBL champion gymnastics team. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6348.056s">As</a> such, Mr. President, I too feel <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6350.942s">sense</a> of pride and sense of achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6353.424s">These</a> are great kids that are good student-athletes that come in here and represent Medford to the highest degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6358.828s">And</a> I'd ask that this resolution be approved and that they be invited down to receive a citation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6384.513s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6386.354s">I</a> believe the 2014-2015 GBL champs are back-to-back champs this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6392.936s">And</a> under the direction of Coach Bates, they've been really achieving at a high level. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6398.298s">I'd</a> like to commend the team, Mr. President, and ask them to come up here and accept a citation for their wonderful achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6403.759s">They,</a> too, are great student athletes that represent Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6406.472s">And,</a> you know, I think that it's a real good thing to allow them to come up here and to be praised for the hard work that they do and for the way that they represent our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6414.598s">On</a> the motion of Councilor Knight for approval, all those in favor?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6439.113s">I</a> guess it was a good winter for Medford High School sports, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6441.755s">Indeed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6441.955s">We</a> have three GBL champions and the 2014-2015 girls hockey team was also able to win the championship this year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6451.541s">So,</a> you know, they're a great team, great girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6455.103s">They</a> do a great job representing the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6457.385s">They</a> wear blue and white in their veins and they represent us well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6460.106s">So,</a> again, I'd like to invite them down as well to receive council accommodation on their great achievement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6641.109s">Mr.</a> President, I did find error in the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6642.71s">I'm</a> working with the individual, and we're trying to see if we can figure out exactly what it is the miscommunication is. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6648.514s">So</a> we're going to allow them to remain on the table.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6672.076s">I'd</a> actually like to make a brief announcement, Mr. President, if I may.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6682.318s">We're</a> having a Committee of the Whole meeting tomorrow evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6685.058s">At</a> 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6685.758s">in</a> room 207 to address the issue of substance abuse in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6690.339s">This</a> is a public meeting that's open to all, and I'd ask for those that have anything to contribute, add. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6695.822s">or</a> participate to come on down. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6698.545s">It's</a> going to be a good beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6700.406s">And</a> also, Mr. President, there's a committee on the rules meeting at 4.30, prior to the subcommittee, the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6706.551s">Will</a> you be serving dinner at that meeting, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6708.773s">I'm</a> thinking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6709.694s">I've</a> got to talk to the clerk and see what he has on the menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/bmoMuW8NubA&t=6711.715s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg/2025-03-21_EHumvCHQbJg.html">Medford City Council - March 10, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1356.215s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1357.656s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Penter, for filing this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1360.738s">I</a> feel as though it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1362.499s">Anytime</a> that we can take steps to connect people with government and ensure that government works for them is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1369.482s">So</a> I certainly will be supporting this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1373.684s">However,</a> I would like to amend the paper by way of a B paper, Mr. President, because I think that it's safe to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1381.438s">You</a> know, the state of our side streets is so that they can't be traveled down as frequently as they have been when no snow has been on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1388.124s">So</a> the wear and tear on our main roads has become excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1391.667s">That</a> coupled with the fact that we've done a good amount of snow removal on those roads has really torn them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1397.032s">And</a> I'd like to see what the cost would be, Mr. President, maybe an estimate from the city engineer explaining to us what the cost would be to resurface all of the emergency arteries in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1407.748s">So</a> I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, asking that the city engineer and the DPW commissioner report back to this council on a cost estimate as to what the price would be to actually resurface from curb to curb each emergency artery in this community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1475.36s">I'm</a> saying our emergency arteries, the dedicated emergency arteries that we have here in the community have been, you know, beat on because of the high volume of travel and the high volume of heavy equipment that's been on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1484.703s">And</a> they're all falling apart as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1486.464s">We</a> have a reporting mechanism here for people to report back whether or not they see something wrong on their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1491.105s">But</a> I think it might also be important for us to, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1493.743s">actually</a> get an estimate of the cost to resurface all those roadways that are in disrepair, so that when someone's coming into Medford from the city of Somerville, they can't tell they've entered Medford because of the way that the street feels.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1536.432s">Right,</a> and I mean, I don't think that the price is going to be the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1540.176s">And</a> then we can always go back and subrogate against whoever we do feel as though is responsible for it to get a collection of our money back in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1546.718s">If</a> we have main street and four different sections of main street are broken up, one's national grid, one's, you know, and star and the other one is the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1553.78s">We're</a> going to do four different construction projects.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1736.345s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1737.726s">It's</a> my pleasure to bring this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1740.168s">I</a> had an opportunity to speak with Councilor Caraviello <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1742.654s">earlier</a> this evening and he was very regretful that he wasn't able to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1747.339s">Mr.</a> Clark was actually waked this evening down at Gaffey Funeral Home and he's a great gentleman, a World War II veteran who was <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1755.519s">on</a> foreign soil in Germany during that great clash, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1760.043s">He</a> raised 10 children here in the city of Medford, and he will be sadly missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1764.987s">I've</a> known Mr. Clark for a number of years, although we hadn't been in touch since I gave up my paper route. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1769.35s">He</a> lived around the corner from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1770.751s">But</a> he was a gentleman, he was a great man, a great family man, raised a great family, served his country well, and he will be sadly missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1777.217s">So</a> I'd ask that this meeting this evening be adjourned in his honor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1899.966s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1902.367s">I</a> think this is a great proactive approach for us to prepare for budget debates that are going to be coming up in very short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1908.456s">And</a> with that being said, on a similar focus, I think it may be important, Mr. President, for the Assessor's Office to report back to us whether collections are keeping up with forecasted revenues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=1920.765s">So</a> I'd like to see a contrast between current collections and projected revenues to date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2866.172s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2868.473s">I</a> think the situation that we're seeing down off of Yale Street and Berwick and Benton and Bradford is really a failure of the street-by-street permitting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2880.215s">If</a> I live on Bradford Road and I have a permit to park on that road and, you know, you're only allowed to park on one side of the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2887.788s">So</a> there's, say, 20 spots, but there's 50 cars on Bradford Road, 50 cars with permits to park on Bradford Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2896.511s">And</a> I can't park on Bradford Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2898.411s">Where</a> am I going to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2899.131s">I'm</a> going to go to the next street over. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2900.512s">However,</a> that street's permitted for residents that just live on that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2903.393s">So</a> by the time I find a parking spot, I'm going to be down in Alexander's, walking all the way up the street to Main and Ovid. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2910.775s">So</a> I think that the street-by-street permitting system that we have in place is not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2917.69s">situations</a> like this highlighted, that coupled with the fact that it's been brought to my attention, and I'm doing some research to figure out if it's the case, is that Bradford, Benton, and Berwick historically were granted a variance to be allowed to park along Yale as well as Bradford, Berwick, and Benton when the permitting parking went into place some four years ago down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2942.05s">So,</a> you know, Republic <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2945.004s">is</a> tasked with the job of enforcing our current ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2950.227s">We've</a> had an ordinance that's on place, and because of the lack of enforcement, we're now seeing a lot of the problems that are coming up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2958.432s">I</a> think that it's very important to note to the individuals that right now are in a situation where they're going to get tickets, and they're going to continue to get tickets, that they need to go before the Traffic Commission and petition for a variance to be allowed to park on Boynton or Yale Street <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2972.518s">The</a> chief is well aware of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2973.899s">The</a> commission is well aware of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2975.56s">And</a> the members of this council are working towards a resolve as evident by the discussion that we're having here this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2982.203s">But,</a> you know, I think that one of the things that we're seeing is a number of abuses that are coming out of renters in these streets with visitor's parking permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2993.109s">They're</a> not registering their car in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2994.99s">They</a> may have five people living in a small apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=2999.032s">They're</a> registering three cars in Medford getting three <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3002.21s">resident</a> parking permits and two visitor passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3005.333s">So</a> on a street that has 48 spots, not in a snow emergency, that's taken down to 20 spots in a snow emergency on one side of the road for 50 cars, and then of those 50 cars, we're seeing another 10 of them with visitor passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3018.347s">It's</a> creating a real, real problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3021.029s">So,</a> you know, I certainly commend the work of Councilor Marksley on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3024.413s">You</a> know, I'm going to do my part. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3025.904s">I'm</a> going to talk to the chief as well and see if we can't find out whether or not this variance is available for the residents that live down there on what I've referred to as the three B's. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3035.377s">off</a> of Yale Street at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3037.378s">But</a> I really think that going forward, this is something that needs to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3041.539s">This</a> is good policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3043.82s">It's</a> not hard to break it down by ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3046.541s">It's</a> not hard to break it down by ward and precinct, for that matter, if, in fact, we have concerns about people coming from the north part of the city and parking at the train station, or people going from the west part of the city and parking close to the bus to get the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3058.866s">But</a> I really think that this is just an example of how the street-by-street permitting system can fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3064.878s">because</a> it just pushes the problem to the next street, and to the next street, and to the next street. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3068.521s">And</a> now we have folks that are in a situation where they're going to have to take a taxi from their car, where they parked, to get to their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3074.825s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like a report back from the Traffic Commission, and I've already made this request privately, as to whether or not there is a variance or a grandfathered exemption for the three Bs off of Yale Street.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/EHumvCHQbJg&t=3862.232s">That</a> matter was discussed previously and I believe we're going to be holding a rules committee meeting on the 18th of this month to discuss papers and committee, one of them being that.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw/2025-03-21_vNUWiKdVZmw.html">Medford City Council - March 3, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=4853.905s">I</a> was just going to suggest, Mr. President, that due to the fact that we're having a committee meeting on this stuff, we'll have a lot of good ideas and a lot of suggestions.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6406.994s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6408.615s">Councilor</a> Marks, thank you for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6410.956s">I</a> think that it's appropriate, directs the question to the proper forum, the proper board and commission that is the authority to make these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6418.862s">Thank</a> you very much for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6421.725s">I'd</a> like to amend the paper, Mr. President, by way of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6425.708s">And</a> I would also like to make a request that the convenience fee of $0.35 be waived on all online transactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6432.313s">I've</a> said from the start that that's been a sticking point of mine where you could actually pay for $0.50 of parking and have $0.70 of fees associated with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6439.859s">So,</a> no question, $1.20 to park for a half an hour and $0.50 worth of parking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6445.623s">So,</a> I'd ask that the paper be amended by way of a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6449.085s">that</a> would request that the Traffic Commission look into waiving the convenience fee of $0.35 for online transactions when using the park mobile app.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6469.242s">I</a> believe the convenience fee was something that was arranged between the third party vendor and Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6477.273s">It's</a> passed on to the consumer, but it's outside the contract with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6480.295s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6481.316s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6866.09s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6867.991s">Another</a> issue that's been brought to my concern that the Traffic Commission should be able to help us out with would be the fact that Republic, when they were here, they represented to us that they'd be more than willing and happy and ready to go over to the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6879.312s">and</a> to conduct trainings with the patrons thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6883.093s">And</a> it's been brought to my attention that although they've been over there once or twice in the past, they've yet to come over actually with the kiosk and do an actual virtual training with the kiosk there in front of people to touch and feel and get comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6896.076s">So</a> I'd also like to amend the paper further and ask that a training be set up at the senior center within the next 30 days, Mr. President, with a virtual kiosk present and available for the people to <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=6908.375s">for</a> lack of a better term, play with.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7909.959s">Um,</a> thank you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7911.32s">I</a> think it's a great idea to have the city engineer report back to us as to where we are in terms of compliance, what the cost is going to be for the taxpayers here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7919.866s">Um,</a> I think it's also important to take a look that if in fact this program is delayed, what effect it's going to have on our watershed. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7925.862s">I</a> think we have a lot of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President, and I certainly don't have a problem asking those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=7930.845s">However,</a> until those questions are answered, I'd be opposed to sending a letter off to the EPA.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8361.354s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8363.763s">I'd</a> like to commend Councilor Caraviello on tackling this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8367.625s">In</a> my time on the Council, we've had a lot of discussion about taxi licenses, about the ordinance that's in place, about whether or not it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8375.249s">And</a> I think that an appropriate first step would be auditing these companies to determine where they're in compliance and where they're in non-compliance so that we can move forward and develop a comprehensive ordinance and make some changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8385.675s">The</a> city clerks work very hard on putting something together that mirrors what they've done in Brookline, which seems to be a rather extensive and comprehensive ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8393.935s">I</a> think that Councilor Caraviello's course of action is an appropriate one where we'll meet weekly or bi-weekly in order to hash this out and get it wrapped up hopefully before the end of the legislative session, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8908.709s">But</a> if Council President, Councilor Penta has an issue, I'll be happy to sit with them and talk about it and we can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/vNUWiKdVZmw&t=8913.433s">So</a> we'll table them until next week.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444/2025-03-21_7XOxP2SN444.html">Medford City Council - February 3, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=392.982s">Move</a> for approval, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=431.623s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=432.423s">At</a> the bottom of the paper submitted by the Mayor's Office, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=435.055s">The</a> alleged defect has been repaired after the accident pursuant to the paper that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=439.379s">It</a> doesn't give the date though. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=441.0s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=442.321s">Do</a> you have the date? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=443.362s">It</a> looks like the date of accident was 11, 7, 14.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1165.797s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1168.098s">Mr.</a> Capuccia, I think when you have to look at the tiered rate system, you'll see that everybody that falls under tier one will be paying <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1174.338s">generally</a> the same rate that they were paying last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1176.239s">It's</a> a conservation measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1177.48s">So</a> it's really based on consumption. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1179.122s">So</a> if you conserve your water usage, you won't see an increase if you stay within that tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1184.446s">However,</a> if you bump up out of that tier, you will see an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1187.128s">But</a> it's a conservation measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1188.328s">It's</a> not necessarily a budgetary item. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1190.01s">I</a> think that the reason that the tiered rate system is going into place more so is for environmental concerns and for conservation issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1196.174s">And</a> I think to control the increases that we're going to see in the future from the MWRA based on our consumption.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1202.64s">Point</a> of further clarification, Councilor, Vice President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1513.312s">Carvey.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1514.133s">I</a> yield the floor, Mr. President, to the chairman of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1515.834s">I</a> didn't see him walk in.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1592.197s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1594.178s">I</a> think when you take a look at these two parcels that are in question, the Meadow Glen Mall and the site of the former Shaw's Supermarket that's vacant right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1601.37s">We</a> have two large parcels of land, and with the appropriate zoning, I feel as though we may be able to generate a mixed-use development of some sort. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1609.514s">Now,</a> I think that it's important to note that we could reclassify this area as a mixed-use zoning area, however. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1616.697s">Maybe</a> the use of an overlay district, maybe something that's more appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1620.351s">So</a> that's why I asked that the Office of Community Development, the Building Department, and the Zoning Board take a look at the options that are available there and present with us recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1628.578s">You</a> know, when I drive down Route 16 and I think about the pending construction that's going to happen, I think about stations landing, I think about Assembly Row, I think about the Meadow Glen Mall that we drive past so that we can get to those places. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1640.487s">And</a> I think with a little bit of effort and a little bit of hard work, Mr. President, I think we might be able to come up with a zoning recommendation for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1647.56s">that</a> will result in a great turnaround. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1649.762s">I</a> think that, you know, when you look at Locust Street and you look at Meadow Glen Mall and you look at the Shaw site, you know, you can have a great vision there of mixed-use development with small commercial, light industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1659.289s">There's</a> a number of housing that's going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1661.23s">And</a> I think that it's important also to think about the zoning overlay district because we have existing businesses that are there that we don't want to displace, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1669.396s">So</a> I bring this resolution forward seeking the guidance and input of these three departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1673.299s">I've</a> had a number of conversations with our Director of Community Development, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1676.774s">I</a> feel as though it does a wonderful job, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1679.315s">And</a> in my conversations with her, you know, we've kicked around a number of different ideas, but I think this is something that's going to take the community as a whole to really come up with and see what their vision is and see what they want to live with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1692.858s">So,</a> you know, I'd like to see a little bit of deliberation on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1696.702s">a</a> little bit of participation and civic involvement from the residents in the community to paint a picture and come up with some sort of development or some sort of vision that they have for the area for mixed-use development, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1706.845s">So</a> I'd ask that my colleagues support this resolution and await the findings of the Building Department, Office of Community Development, and Zoning Board, should they be willing to support this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1807.514s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1809.746s">Just</a> two short weeks ago, Mr. McGonigal, our assistant coach of the Medford High School Mustang Boys Baseball Team, was presented with the Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association Assistant Coach of the Year Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1821.657s">This</a> is a very prestigious award, and I don't think it should go without recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1825.72s">Simultaneously,</a> at the same event, a longtime South Medford Little League volunteer, Lonnie Hilson Sr., was given the baseball <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1834.427s">the</a> Massachusetts Baseball Coaches Association Community Service Award for his over 50 years of community involvement and donating of his time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1840.632s">So</a> I think it's only justified that we recognize these two individuals for their commitment to the city of Medford and to the betterment of student athletes here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1949.884s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1950.305s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1951.55s">Mr.</a> President, Chief Sacco is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1952.71s">I</a> think it might be appropriate for Chief Sacco to say a few words on behalf of Mr. Goulding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=1955.812s">If</a> you could.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2493.679s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2494.479s">I,</a> too, agree with Councilor Penter in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2497.56s">We</a> need to get a little bit better understanding as to where our new Attorney General is coming from in regard to her approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2502.923s">And</a> again, there's been litigation, ongoing litigation, so I think that it would make sense maybe for us to let the lawyers do the lawyering, provide us with some information, and let us make informed decisions thereafter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2513.53s">But</a> I think at this point in time, the position of the Attorney General is very, very important to this body and to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2520.078s">In</a> terms of Mr. Sachs and his retirement, I wish him the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2523.061s">I</a> hope that he goes on to have a great, great, great retirement and enjoy the sunny beaches of Florida or wherever it is he may end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2530.168s">Yes,</a> indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=2531.129s">Councilor</a> Camuso.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3771.921s">Thank</a> you, councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3772.662s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3773.722s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3774.603s">Thank</a> you very much, Councilor Marks, for initiating a discussion on Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3779.546s">One</a> of the things that you said was that, you know, the value of our homes is directly tied to the success of our schools and the success of our downtown business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3787.25s">And</a> I think another thing that's important to point out is that the value of our homes is also tied to location, location, location, and we're in a great location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3795.094s">Medford</a> Square is a great location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3797.066s">And</a> as Councilor Mark said, you know, we have two parcels of land that are underdeveloped down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3801.787s">We</a> have great access to public transit in Medford Square, but we have no people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3805.469s">And</a> I think that it might make sense for us to maybe take a look at integrating some affordable housing or some moderate to low-income housing down in the area to actually put people in the square so that when these businesses do open and if we do get an economic development plan in place, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3817.615s">and</a> we start to generate new businesses, we actually have people that are going to go shop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3820.636s">And</a> they can do so by walking there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3821.977s">They</a> can do so by riding their bikes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=3823.718s">They</a> can do so by using alternative modes of transportation other than their vehicle, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4411.734s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4412.494s">I'd</a> like to thank both Councilors Caraviello and Penta for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4416.575s">I</a> think it's important to point out for those of us at home who would like to maybe understand Mr. Mombo-Kett's story a little bit better, that it is memorialized down at Placed at Park, right behind home plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4427.116s">There</a> is a plaque down there that speaks about his achievements and <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4431.065s">his</a> professional achievements, but also his personal achievements and what he's done in the community of Medford to improve our quality of life here and to improve the lives of young athletes in the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4439.893s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=4440.853s">Councilor</a> Caraviello.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6244.57s">Thank</a> you, Jimmy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6245.59s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6247.351s">Yeah,</a> Mr. President, I think that Mr. Spiracus makes a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6250.686s">When</a> you look at the money that we're bringing in on meals tax, that shows almost a direct correlation as to how well our businesses in downtown are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6258.072s">So</a> I think it might make sense for us to get some numbers in terms of what we collected pre-parking enforcement so that we can have something to compare them to at a later time so we can have a benchmark as to what business was like before parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6271.662s">Then</a> maybe we can do a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6273.283s">We</a> already have one on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6274.544s">We</a> can take a look at a 90-day review and match those numbers up with the same time last year and see exactly what the impact is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6280.74s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6872.547s">I</a> think it might make sense that we go through the actual changes that the Traffic Commission has made prior to, you know, going through each point and making critical commentary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6882.352s">You</a> know, we're talking about locations of kiosks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6885.073s">We</a> went from, we're on to item C, 10-minute grace period at the end of paid time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6888.254s">Now</a> we're talking about locations of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6890.115s">I</a> think we're really kind of veering off course here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6892.877s">The</a> purpose of the Chief to come up here was to tell us what changes were made since the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6896.098s">So</a> why don't we let the Chief explain to us what the changes were made, and then after that, we can present our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6900.56s">But</a> maybe we can let him get through it <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=6902.267s">a</a> little bit cleaner and easier for people to understand.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7017.621s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7018.441s">As</a> I remember it, Mr. President, Mr. Nash came up and Mr. Nash says that we'll said that we'd work to waive all the tickets issued on January 15th, 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7025.766s">Um,</a> however, if it was a handicap violation, a bus stop or a fire hydrant, that was something that they weren't willing to entertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7031.951s">However,</a> any type of kiosk violation was my understanding was with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7034.973s">They</a> were willing to live, but however, any type of violation that would be, you know, a normal infraction that necessarily wouldn't be, <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7042.071s">a</a> creature of the parking management program wouldn't be waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7047.196s">You</a> know, if you're parking in a bus stop or a fire hydrant or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7049.538s">That</a> was my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7050.398s">And</a> I think we all did agree that those tickets would not be waived in terms of handicap or a fire hydrant.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7182.723s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7184.303s">I</a> also believe Mr. Nash stated when he was here that they were going to assist the City of Medford getting them at a cheaper cost because they were using their purchase power that they have because they're a national company that does this across the country so they buy more of this type of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=7197.046s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8470.455s">Point</a> of information, Counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8471.876s">Good</a> night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8472.657s">It's</a> my understanding, Chief, that when a ticket is issued, it's recorded in the latitude and longitude of the vehicle is recorded, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8480.142s">On</a> their plate reader, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8480.982s">On</a> their plate reader, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8481.803s">So</a> it would be safe to say that if, in fact, a citation is issued that's outside the realm of a permit parking street, that they'd be able to pull that information right up on their system and show where the vehicle was parked and whether or not it was within <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8495.745s">All's</a> good in Capen or Austin between Prescott and high, but not Austin between high and Uber. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8502.548s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8503.808s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8504.049s">They</a> just need to have the actual information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=8507.47s">If</a> you don't have good information, you're not going to put out good stuff.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9162.914s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9164.715s">I'd</a> like to congratulate Tiffany and Salvatore on the birth of their first child, as well as Josephine and Big Sal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9171.292s">and</a> Paula and Billy on the birth of their new granddaughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7XOxP2SN444&t=9173.794s">It's</a> a very exciting time for these families and I just wanted to let them know that we're thinking of them during this time.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6219.449s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6221.911s">I</a> think based upon what we're hearing today, we can all agree that the plan is not perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6227.273s">This</a> is not a perfect plan and we all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6230.654s">And</a> I think the reason that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6233.207s">there's</a> so much frustration is because the lack of transparency in the process in establishing this plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6238.891s">And</a> because the process wasn't open and transparent, now we're in the situation we're in where there are a lot of questions, and it seems like there's a lot of reaction and reactivity versus being proactive and proactivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6252.242s">Chief</a> Sacco's done an excellent job, Mr. President, I feel, in addressing the concerns of the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6256.705s">He's</a> been out there, and he's been working very hard on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6258.967s">As</a> Councilman Locke said, he right now is the face of this program, and there's no question about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6263.451s">He's</a> been working far too many hours, in my opinion, on establishing a parking management program and a little less on making sure that the other essential functions of our police department are up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6274.401s">I</a> think that this is almost becoming a distraction at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6278.465s">But</a> I guess the question is, where do we go from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6282.188s">And</a> what are our options from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6284.009s">And</a> in looking at the situation, we can go forward as the plan's presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6288.768s">It</a> is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6290.569s">We</a> can work towards trying to get the contract bought out and eliminate the contract, but I don't think that that's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6296.092s">I</a> don't think that's a reality of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6297.773s">I</a> don't think that that's something we're going to be able to be successful with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6301.195s">However,</a> I think that over the past three weeks, we have been very successful at moving this project and this plan towards something that everybody can live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6309.179s">And,</a> you know, I think that if we're going to make a commitment to parking enforcement or the parking management plan that's in place, we've seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6317.815s">people</a> from Republic that have been willing to work with us, we've seen the Traffic Commission that's taking our concerns very seriously, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6324.28s">So</a> I think that in looking at what our best option is, our best option is to continue the discussion, to continue the dialogue, to keep this issue here at the table, to keep the Committee of the Whole open so that we can continue to make changes to the existing plan so that we can have a successful downtown. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6338.991s">And</a> when I look at the plan, I think that there are some other areas that we need to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6343.342s">And</a> if we want to make this work, we need to take a look at the comprehensive zoning that we have in our downtown business areas to ensure that we're attracting sustainable businesses based upon the zoning regulations and ordinances that we have in place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6355.127s">I</a> also think it's important that, because this is a parking management plan, it might be very suitable for us to take a look at what we can do to take cars off the road and to improve pedestrian-oriented transit and multimodal transportation down in our business district, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6369.951s">So</a> I think the proper course of action for us to move forward at this point in time would be to continue this discussion to talk about what changes that we can continue to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6377.252s">We've</a> been very successful over the past three weeks in addressing the concerns that have been brought to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6382.113s">Thankfully,</a> the people from our public and the chief have been willing to work with us and have been very, very patient in addressing our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6388.475s">And</a> I think that we've been patient because of the frustrations and the lack of open, transparent process that's been in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6395.036s">We</a> need to ask the residents to be patient because we're getting responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6398.077s">We're</a> moving in the right direction, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=6400.019s">So</a> I think, you know, based upon the options that we have here before us, it's in our best interest to keep the paper before the council to keep it open and to continue the dialogue and continue the conversation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9082.094s">Madam</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9084.501s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9084.701s">Martin,</a> you said something that really resonated with me, and it's something that I know our representative has been working on very hard for a number of years, and that is the closure of the Salem Street Car Barn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9094.546s">I</a> think that's very necessary, and it's something that's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9098.067s">I</a> think the closure of the Salem Street Car Barn would actually bring an effort and an opportunity for us to beautify the area, but more importantly, it'll improve the quality of life for the residents in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9108.892s">I</a> know I've worked when I was in the legislature with Senator Shannon, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9113.792s">with</a> Representative Donato on a number of occasions in making an attempt to get the carbon out of there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9119.395s">But</a> I'm pretty sure, if my memory serves me correctly, that the representative was able to secure some funding in order to perform a study and a plan to relocate the carbons to Wellington Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=9129.68s">I</a> don't know how far along we are in that process, but what I'll do is reach out to him and I'll let you know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10787.61s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10789.37s">Councilor</a> Marks brings up a good point about the impact that <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10794.521s">a</a> gaming facility is going to have on our transportation infrastructure here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10799.885s">And</a> then we're sitting here talking about some grant funds that are available to us and what to do with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10804.269s">And</a> I think it might make sense for us to maybe look at hiring a full-time transportation planner, someone that can look at the issues that are affecting our city, can determine what's going on, what impact they're having, and what direction we need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10816.539s">But</a> someone that's a professional, not someone that we're going to give $100,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=10819.663s">to</a> do a study to give us the study back and then disappear, but someone that's going to be on staff, or someone maybe that we can work with regionally with our neighbors in Malden and Everett, who are also going to be impacted at Wellington Circle by the, well, maybe not so much Everett, because they're going to have PNC or money coming in from wind management, but Malden, to help us out and maybe approach this issue regionally so that we can pool our resources and that we can get more bang for our buck.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=505.027s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President, and thank you, Councilor Camuso, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=510.068s">In</a> my time on the Council, I've seen similar papers to this where we want to set up an account, whether it be for capital improvements or a rainy day fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=516.829s">And</a> I think it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=517.849s">I</a> think this is something that the city needs to build upon some of the commentary that Councilor Pinter has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=524.511s">I</a> think funding this account is going to be vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=527.691s">Setting</a> it up is one thing, but funding the account is certainly something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=532.052s">I</a> would be very wary, however, of going forward and putting together an actual dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=536.354s">I</a> think that the way we might want to look at this is whether it be a percentage of free cash or whether or not a threshold is met and then a certain percentage can go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=544.918s">If</a> we have $6 million in free cash, then no less than 5% will go into the stabilization fund, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=550.76s">We</a> can get very creative with the language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=552.541s">I</a> think that we can really get some bang for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=554.891s">provided</a> that the administration's on board, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=557.413s">This</a> is a paper that I'll be supporting wholeheartedly, and I ask my council colleagues to join me, commend Councilor Camuso for bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=563.476s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=564.497s">Councilor</a> Lungo-Koehn.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1216.841s">I</a> think everybody's made some very good points here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1219.483s">I</a> think it's important to point out, though, if there's no account, then there's, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1223.495s">no</a> place to put this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1224.495s">So</a> I think that the establishment of the account is going to be critical in this success. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1228.917s">I</a> also think that moving forward, we probably should sit in the Committee of the Whole and discuss what we'd like to see happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1238.201s">And</a> we can do that every single year, and we don't have to set necessarily a criteria that's going to be carried on from the day that it's implemented until the day that it's ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1245.925s">We</a> might be able to propose three or four different options as to how to fund this account once the account is exactly established. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1252.04s">based</a> upon the financial picture, the financial snapshot that we received at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1256.564s">So</a> I can certainly understand Councilor Muck's point where he says we can create the account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1261.248s">Once</a> the account's created, then we lose all control and oversight over the account and our recommendations are just going to be that, just recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1266.853s">Whereas</a> if we have this paper in the committee of the whole and we sit down and we vet it properly and we go on to really create a program and we present it to the mayor for him to either accept or deny, then it's on him as to whether or not he wants to establish this capital improvement trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1280.932s">or</a> long-term stabilization account, a rainy day account, or whatever you want to call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1285.276s">So</a> I certainly could see both sides of the issue here, but I think that the most important thing really is establishing the account first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1292.002s">And</a> once we get the account established, then we can figure out what we're going to do and how we're going to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1295.266s">And</a> we can do that every year during budget time.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1739.307s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1742.128s">I</a> know that there's been recent discussions from the Baker administration that there may be an edict or requirement that municipalities do establish a rainy day fund or a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1750.933s">Until</a> that comes to fruition, you know, that's just rumor, that's just talk, that's just hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1755.825s">However,</a> this is something that may be coming down the line, so I do think it's important that we stay proactive on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1761.308s">The</a> resolution reads right now, be it resolved that the City of Medford establish a long-term stabilization fund to offset any major projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1769.232s">I</a> think that language is good enough in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1770.893s">I</a> think we can now figure out what course we want to take, whether or not it's a budgeted line item, whether or not it's a separate account, whether or not <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1779.287s">we</a> can sit down and negotiate, discuss, and plan a way to implement this.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1785.81s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Marks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1805.099s">I'm</a> coming around full circle to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1806.959s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1807.98s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1808.969s">Yeah,</a> so, you know, in looking at it, I think that, you know, that the language of the resolution is what the language of the resolution is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1814.292s">We</a> have a number of members here that are all pretty much on the same page in terms of supporting the idea and supporting the theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1821.235s">So</a> I think it might make sense to support the theory, support the language that's before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1825.196s">Then</a> we can sit down with the committee of the whole or a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1827.798s">We</a> can have Anne Baker, the budget director, we can have <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1831.312s">the</a> May account and sit down with us and figure out what it is they can live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1833.974s">Whether</a> it's not, there's something that if they're willing to put a line item budget in, if they're not, if they want it in the budget and we don't, that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1839.518s">We</a> can negotiate, we can discuss, and we can plan ways to implement this and ways to fund this sitting down at the same table all together as opposed to it's an us versus them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1847.624s">This</a> is what we say, what do you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1849.085s">Why</a> don't we say, let's set up the account, we all agree that we need an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1852.088s">Then</a> we can sit down in the same room and figure out exactly what the plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1855.09s">A</a> mutually agreeable plan that we can all live with in terms of how we're going to fund this and what direction we want to see the account going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1860.644s">Thank</a> you, Council Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=1861.645s">Councilor</a> Lococo.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2384.364s">Councilor</a> Knight, we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2386.425s">Be</a> it resolved the city of Medford established a long-term stabilization fund to help offset any major projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2391.867s">Upon</a> passage of the resolution, a committee of the whole be established with officials from the administration to discuss the funding thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2397.409s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=2397.929s">Councilor</a> Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6492.026s">I</a> just have a couple of questions and one request. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6496.128s">And</a> the request chief would be that during the early phases of the rollout of this parking management plan, that we move the traffic commission meetings to off hours so that people can come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6506.354s">Members</a> of the general public who have issue or concern can come. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6509.675s">Um,</a> the, the second request chief that I have of you was, um, I believe it was last like last week or maybe the meeting before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6516.137s">Um,</a> I asked that you just describe to us what the process is to petition the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6521.919s">If</a> in fact there is an issue or request for action or some sort of grievance that somebody has relative to the placement of a kiosk, the placement of the placement of a spot, a sign, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6532.343s">I</a> think it's very important for the people to understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6534.984s">Um,</a> if in fact there is an issue or grievance or a problem, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6537.831s">that</a> there is a place to go and, um, you know, that this body deliberates and does have that control and that power.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6603.913s">I</a> think it's also important to point out chief that if there's a loading zone in one of our business districts that that loading zone is in for that particular business, but rather it's a loading zone for, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6612.452s">vehicles</a> that are making deliveries to park and service all the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6615.733s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6649.179s">And</a> the last question that I have, Chief, is that I believe that you represented that the residential transaction fee for convenience when making this transaction online has been waived. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6659.184s">And</a> Mr. Nash has worked hard with the administrative authorities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6671.374s">I</a> guess my question is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6672.836s">When</a> can people expect to see a refund?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6723.655s">End</a> of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6724.476s">Beautiful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6724.736s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6725.176s">Mr.</a> Nash, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6725.977s">I</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6770.006s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6770.646s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=6771.127s">Thank</a> you for your patience.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10954.827s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10955.388s">Chief,</a> there's a revenue sharing <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10958.469s">agreement</a> on all tickets that are issued by the enforcement ambassadors? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10965.911s">Enforcement</a> ambassadors, and there's a revenue sharing component to that, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10971.072s">Where-</a> There is, but I'm not totally familiar with the dollar amounts and any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10974.793s">Adversely,</a> the Manfred Police Department still does maintain the right to enforce parking restrictions in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=10982.594s">Is</a> there a reciprocal revenue share?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11624.278s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11627.7s">I</a> certainly don't have a problem <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11629.717s">having</a> dialogue and hearing from individuals that have concern over the parking management program, the parking enhancement program, the revenue enhancement program or whatever it is that we're all calling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11639.942s">Um,</a> I just think it's very important that if in fact we're going to have people come up here to speak to this council, we give them the opportunity to do so because they have to wake up tomorrow morning and go to work and keeping them here from seven o'clock until 10 30 or 11 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11651.594s">for</a> them to have the opportunity to come up to this podium and speak, I think is a little bit much to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11655.78s">So</a> in the future, I think, Mr. President, it might make sense when we have people from the general public that are here that want to raise questions and want to have answers about this parking program, that they're allowed to speak first, Mr. President, so that we can let them get their questions out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11667.276s">we</a> can let them get their questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11669.037s">That's</a> going to raise questions that we have, obviously, and absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11671.539s">There's</a> no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11672.9s">But</a> I think we are in a unique position when we have access to the people from Republic, to the Traffic Commission, to the Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11679.085s">I</a> mean, Chief Sacco is probably tired of hearing from me at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11682.247s">I</a> call him so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11683.528s">But</a> at the end of the day, we have access, and the individuals in the community don't have that same access that we have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11688.472s">I</a> have no problem continuing this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11690.313s">I</a> have no problem staying here until tomorrow morning if we have to, to listen to the concerns of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11695.863s">To</a> listen to those concerns, I have no problem whatsoever, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11698.905s">When</a> it turns into political theater and a little bit less more about action and results is when I get concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11705.509s">And</a> I'm not saying that that's happening, but I'm saying it has the potential to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11708.671s">And</a> I think right now we're in a spot where we've had three or four meetings on the same topic, and they've gone late into the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11715.094s">They've</a> gone late into the night, but most of the people from the general public haven't even had an opportunity to express their concerns until 9 or 10 o'clock in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11721.578s">And</a> I think it would make more sense moving forward and be more encouraging for people to come out if in fact they could come here and take the floor immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11729.222s">Or</a> they could come here and they could be heard first without interruption and then we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11732.424s">And</a> I'm guilty of it just as much as anybody else behind here with my points of information and with my questions and my concerns in between speakers lining up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11738.947s">But</a> I think if we're going to move forward and we're going to be serious about speaking about this issue, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11742.796s">and</a> speaking about it every week because we want results for the concerns that are being raised, then we need to let those concerns reach the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11748.479s">We</a> need to let those concerns resonate and saturate, and we need to give the chief an opportunity to address them before we start chiming in with our two cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11756.562s">It's</a> a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11757.422s">The</a> process is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11758.423s">We</a> know what the process is if we have problems, questions, concerns, and grievances. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11761.964s">I</a> think that at the end of the day, they're not falling on deaf ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11765.286s">We're</a> seeing a lot of success. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11766.466s">Councilor</a> Marks is absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11768.173s">Why</a> would we close this down right now when we're seeing results? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11770.635s">We're</a> seeing results left and right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11773.318s">I</a> don't have a problem keeping it open, Mr. President, but I would like to see maybe more of a commitment to allowing the residents really express themselves and a little bit less of us interrupting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11782.105s">And</a> like I said, I'm guilty of it just as much as anybody else, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11785.869s">So</a> I have no problem keeping the matter open weekly, monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11789.823s">you</a> know, in subcommittee, um, if we want to maybe all convene, um, on the Wednesday night, we can meet down there when the chief is having his presentation with the people of Republic, um, Wednesday night at his public safety meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11800.12s">Something</a> like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11800.701s">I'm</a> open to all suggestions, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11802.302s">I</a> just want to be sure that the people coming up here feel as though they're going to be heard, because I've seen a number of people that were here in the audience walking around and get up and leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11809.047s">Like</a> Mr. Tomazak was here last week, and he ended up leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11811.469s">I</a> saw a couple of other residents in the audience that were here as long as they could be here, and they left. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11816.933s">So</a> I just think that it's important they get their chance to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=11819.755s">We</a> have this forum

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12331.919s">This</a> resolution is no more than an attempt to institute best practices of human resource management here within the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12339.164s">There</a> are several positions that are under council purview relative to appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12343.137s">I'd</a> like to see if we can maybe establish job descriptions for those positions as well as a performance evaluation tool to determine that the people that we do appoint to these roles are actually meeting the obligations that we feel as though are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12354.985s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12355.586s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Light.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12416.358s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12418.539s">As</a> I said, when we had this discussion previously, and the clerk can attest to the fact that I've sent this resolution to him a number of times, and he's been working on going through the statute to determine what positions are <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12428.788s">statutorily</a> or by statute under council purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12433.751s">Quiet</a> in the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12435.912s">Yeah,</a> there are a number of positions by statute that are under council purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12439.114s">Embelt,</a> Hornell, the city clerk, the city messenger, the videographers, I believe are other ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12443.956s">I</a> just want to institute human resources, best practices, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12447.138s">I</a> don't think it's unreasonable to have people vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12449.259s">I</a> don't think it's unreasonable to have a performance evaluation criteria to be sure that people are meeting the requirements of the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12455.742s">And</a> I don't think that it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12456.949s">a</a> bad idea to have a job description for a job that people are performing, so that we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12461.491s">That's</a> all I'm trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12462.371s">There's</a> no ulterior motive.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12531.226s">Again,</a> again.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12535.369s">The</a> gentleman's taking the ship that's going down a straight road, and he's turning left. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12539.232s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12539.728s">This</a> is for appointments that are statutory. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12542.529s">All</a> I wanted to do is say we have the M-Belt, we have Hormel, we have the city clerk, we have the city messenger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12546.869s">We</a> have two videographers in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12548.71s">I</a> don't know if the videographers know what their job requirements are, their job descriptions are, if there's a base of knowledge that they need in order to have these appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12555.151s">That's</a> what I'm looking for, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12556.632s">Best</a> practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12557.792s">Best</a> practices in vetting appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12559.832s">That's</a> it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12568.841s">because</a> I can't operate in a vacuum and create these performance evaluations and job descriptions myself.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12582.792s">Well,</a> he didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12584.413s">You've</a> been working on it for seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12585.994s">And</a> Eddie, when did I ask you to make the initial request?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12598.271s">Right,</a> because you said you were working on finding out if there were any other statutory positions that were out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12602.493s">So</a> I said, I'll give you the opportunity to continue to research these statutory positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12607.156s">And</a> it came to a point now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12608.396s">It's</a> been seven months. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12610.017s">Enough's</a> enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12610.458s">Let's</a> put the resolution on it to get the teeth in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12613.94s">The</a> only reason I brought this resolution forward was to ensure that we're practicing under the best practices out there that's in every single human resource organization across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12623.445s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Camuso.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12719.326s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to amend the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12722.385s">I'd</a> like to strike out the words for the purpose of establishing a performance evaluation criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12726.327s">When</a> the clerk gets the information to me, then I can make a subsequent resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12739.225s">Just</a> striking out the words for the purpose of establishing performance evaluation criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12742.828s">It</a> seems that was a sticking point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12744.129s">We</a> can have the clerk give us a listing of the positions, and then if I feel as though it's appropriate to move forward with the resolution at a later date, I will.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12793.551s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12796.038s">Aggie</a> Tootin, our tree warden, was awarded the Seth H. Swift Tree Warden of the Year Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12801.82s">And</a> this is the Tree Warden of the Year for 2015, reflective of the work that she did in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12807.602s">It's</a> been brought forward by the Massachusetts Tree Wardens and Forestry Association, which is a statewide professional organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12813.785s">And</a> I'd like to congratulate Aggie on being recognized by her peers as a leader in the industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12818.086s">I'd</a> like to thank her for her hard work here in the city of Medford and invite her down for a city council citation, provided that my colleagues so support the idea.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12856.435s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12857.756s">I</a> had previously brought this resolution forward the night of torrential rains when Councilor Marks was unfortunately taken away from us due to a flooding issue at his home. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12868.002s">And</a> I brought the resolution forward because we had recently had a licensing committee meeting to discuss the fees for taxicab companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12874.366s">A</a> lot of other issues had come up in that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12877.488s">We</a> see a number of individuals petition this council for taxicab licenses and license to operate taxis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12883.653s">And</a> there's a lot of concern about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12885.394s">There</a> are several councilors that refrain from voting in certain instances until there's a new ordinance in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12891.955s">The</a> city clerk has worked very hard on putting together a new ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12895.196s">I</a> think it's time that maybe we take a look at what areas of noncompliance are in place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12899.817s">So</a> if in fact we are serious about moving forward and creating a new ordinance, we know where to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=12904.079s">We</a> know where the number one offenders are, we know where the number one problems lay, and we know what we can do to fix it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13346.116s">Yeah,</a> loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13347.477s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13348.878s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13351.499s">I</a> think if, in fact, we're going to send code enforcement down there, it may also make sense to send the Board of Health down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13356.683s">We</a> have a vacant building boarded up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13358.024s">Who</a> knows what rodents are inside or what else for that matter, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13363.015s">I'd</a> ask that if in fact we are going to send somebody down there to take a look at the property that we also include the Board of Health.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13766.41s">Um,</a> I was just wondering if the clerk or the president would be so kind as to read that back one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13771.832s">I'd</a> be delighted.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13856.12s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly support the resolution in theory, in substance, pretty much except for <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13865.131s">I</a> don't like the tone that it sets forth, saying, knowing that NSTAR is the monopoly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13868.613s">It</a> just seems like it's very argumentative, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13871.215s">And</a> I think if we're going to be going to these people and asking them to work with us and to maybe provide us with a little bit more information, or to come into our community and repair our streets the way that they're supposed to be repaired, or coming before us and asking for permits, that we have a good, strong working relationship with them, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13885.827s">Again,</a> I don't disagree saying that NSTAR is the monopoly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13889.289s">I</a> just think that the tone, if we're going to send this to our federal delegation, has to show a little bit more respect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13894.452s">I'd</a> be willing to support the resolution provided that the knowing the N star is a monopoly language was stricken from the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13901.174s">If</a> not, I'd just like to be recorded in opposition as supporting the resolution in theory, but not based upon the language submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13907.296s">Councilor</a> Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13919.859s">You</a> don't want it to go there?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13922.6s">That's</a> the amendment.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13925.818s">The</a> motion is amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13926.438s">You're</a> not amending it, are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13927.218s">He</a> did not have to amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13928.319s">I</a> said if you're willing to strike it, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13929.759s">I'll</a> vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13930.26s">If</a> you're not willing to strike it, then I'd just like to be recorded in the opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13932.701s">No,</a> I'm not going to strike it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13933.621s">Supporting</a> it in theory, however, I have a problem with the language.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13941.984s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13946.826s">Ask</a> the clerk that it be recorded in the opposition.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13968.496s">I'm</a> going to need one more shot at these, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13971.196s">I</a> see a couple of errors that I'm trying to work out based upon the tape that I have at my house, and I'm getting there, but it's going to take me one more week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=13977.898s">So</a> I'd ask that those records be tabled.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ/2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ.html">Medford City Council - January 6, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2337.389s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2340.431s">Mr.</a> President, I think that it's about time we move on the question.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2381.747s">Mr.</a> President, at the present time, we adopted the standing rules of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2384.148s">So</a> those committees are presently, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=2385.952s">enacted</a> until we make a change to the rules of the standing rules.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6749.068s">And</a> I think you're eager to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6750.629s">You</a> echo my sentiment, uh, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6753.091s">Um,</a> I think we have a number of people here that are lining up in queue that have questions that they want answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6757.195s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6757.668s">some</a> of which are business owners that probably have to get up very early tomorrow morning to be sure that operations are up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6763.131s">With</a> that being said, you made a suggestion at the beginning of the meeting that we might want to reserve our questions for the end, allow the folks from Republic and the Traffic Commission to get an understanding of what the questions are that are coming to them so they can answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6775.037s">I</a> think we're in a position to have the good fortune of being able to reach out to these folks and get return calls and speak with them much more frequently and much more easily than the people that are here in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=6784.221s">And</a> they've been waiting patiently, Mr. President, so I'd ask that maybe we can
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8461.782s">So</a> there could actually be an instance where we pay $0.50 to park our spot and $0.70 in fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8469.466s">If</a> you put $0.25 on the meter and you have to pay by your phone $0.25 for 15 minutes, then they charge you $0.35 on the $0.25. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8476.07s">So</a> it's over 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8478.611s">If</a> you choose to use the service for that transaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8481.112s">And</a> then say we put another $0.25 in because we were going over our 15 minutes on our phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8487.135s">We</a> added time to the meter, which is a capability, as I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8490.657s">We'd</a> be charged another 35 cents for adding another quarter run. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8493.819s">If</a> you choose to do that, that would be the transaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8495.861s">So</a> in essence, for a 50 cent, half an hour spot, I'd be paying a dollar 25.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8507.869s">Um,</a> I wouldn't be so sure to say that because today councilor Caraviello and I went down to Bocelli's to have dinner and I went to the kiosk and I put my credit card information and everything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8517.296s">And</a> I wasn't, I was unable to pay through my, through my, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8520.508s">Park</a> Medford application today and I put the money in, but when I read the terms and conditions, I didn't see that there would be an additional fee.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8545.232s">I</a> already did register. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8546.052s">I</a> have a key. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8547.433s">I</a> haven't, if I go to Somerville, I can use my, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8550.782s">device,</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8552.122s">Because</a> you guys are the same company and you have the same database and all that, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8562.446s">No,</a> I didn't sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8563.426s">I</a> signed up in Medford, but I'm saying it's not available in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8566.067s">But</a> if I drove across the city to Somerville and I booked, would that same transaction fee apply? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8570.348s">And</a> I guess the answer is yes? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8571.348s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8571.708s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8573.009s">And</a> is that part of the contract that the third-party vendor has put together between Republican and you? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8578.45s">Or</a> is that part of this contract that's governing <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=8580.921s">the</a> relationship between the city of Medford and Republic?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11656.929s">Chief,</a> do you have any idea right now under the current system what percentage of tickets are issued? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11664.114s">What</a> percentage of issued tickets are appealed? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11667.116s">I</a> don't know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11945.768s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11955.818s">Canal</a> Street, Friend Street, Portland Street, they all have kiosks.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11960.342s">It's</a> not downtown Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11962.782s">A</a> number of different communities in New York City, New York State, California, Los Angeles County, they have kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11971.211s">I</a> think that they're new, they're scary, but at the end of the day, we're going to be able to figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11976.177s">I</a> don't think that we're giving the public enough credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11978.439s">in</a> terms of their ability to adapt to new technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11981.903s">We've</a> all done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11982.743s">We've</a> seen people come along and be able to work computers like wizards after a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11987.748s">It</a> is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11988.529s">I</a> think that, you know, we're in a situation right now where we can go and we can talk about the past and we can talk about what happened, or we can look forward to see, all right, these are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11997.217s">What's</a> the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=11998.078s">How</a> are we going to deal with our griefs and our gripes and our grievances? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12001.381s">And</a> in order for us to move forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12003.906s">I</a> think we really need to look at the plan and say the plan's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12007.31s">These</a> are the, these are the recourses that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12009.353s">The</a> traffic commission governs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12011.195s">We</a> have the traffic commission and we go to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12014.439s">That's</a> the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12015.139s">There's</a> a process in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12016.221s">Now</a> we can talk about the process that didn't happen to get us to where we are, or we can look forward and we can say, this is the process that we need to take in order to make this a successful plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12024.544s">And</a> that's where I am with this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12026.726s">I</a> think that, you know, the history is the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12029.369s">We</a> all know what we voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12030.55s">We</a> voted to give the mayor the authority to enter into a contract for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12033.434s">That's</a> what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12034.375s">And</a> we allowed him to go to the table and negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12036.537s">He</a> went to the table, he negotiated, and this is what he came back with. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12039.52s">We</a> have our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12040.381s">We</a> all have our concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12041.262s">And</a> we've all had individual conversations with the chief and with the people from Republic and with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12046.167s">But</a> I think that right now, for the people out there that have concerns and that are scared and that are worried about what's going to happen, we need to tell them what the process is and provide them with an avenue to get answers to have their concerns addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12058.314s">Because</a> in my experiences so far, I've gotten a number of calls about people that had issues about loading zones, and loading zones have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12065.117s">The</a> folks from Republic have been pretty reasonable in terms of making accommodations to make this program and plan work for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12073.802s">If</a> we're going to roll out a plan that's going to be successful and that people are going to buy into, we need to look at the future and what avenues we have in order to address problems, not the past and what didn't happen and what should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12085.83s">Thank</a> you, Councilor, for your point of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12253.257s">Followed</a> by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12254.939s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12258.164s">Personally,</a> I don't feel as though Republic should be putting up any signs, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12261.328s">And</a> the reason so is because that work is DPW work. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12263.691s">And</a> we have a gentleman in the sign shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12265.793s">who</a> has a job, and his job is to be in charge of the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12268.995s">So</a> this subletting of work that should be done by the DBW, I feel as though is a problem, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12276.619s">I</a> think that this work should be handled internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12278.359s">We</a> have a sign shop, we have a gentleman that's in charge of signs, and we have a gentleman who's well versed in the ordinances in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12284.643s">Quite</a> frankly, Mr. Nash isn't from Medford, he came to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12288.087s">and</a> maybe he relied on what he saw or what he's seen in other communities, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12292.611s">But</a> we have a sign shop, we have gentlemen in the DPW who know our ordinances, and I think that this is where the work should lie, not outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12298.455s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12311.284s">Any</a> information, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12314.909s">The</a> contract that you're referring to is the contract with Republic, but the City of Medford also has a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12320.092s">The</a> contract is with the Medford DPW Association, represented by Local 25, and they have rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12326.535s">And</a> if they aren't willing to sublet their work, and they haven't had an opportunity to negotiate the impact of the subletting of their work, then there's a violation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12343.63s">that</a> the union contract has been repudiated based upon the fact that outside people- So you're just stating again tonight that the may is in violation of the union contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12349.811s">That's</a> my interpretation, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12351.212s">That's</a> my interpretation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12976.064s">It's</a> going to be a long year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12976.845s">If</a> I may be so bold to suggest, please do, that if certain individuals want a paper, they file a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=12985.428s">And</a> we can talk about it next week.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13863.422s">I</a> would certainly agree that history is important, but history is history, and it's time for us to move on now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13925.572s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13927.416s">As</a> many of you are aware, Michael Callahan and I were dear friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13930.482s">And</a> four years ago this evening, he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13934.095s">Michael</a> Callahan was a public servant for 48 years working in the federal and state and local government. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13941.257s">He</a> was the consumer commissioner for the Medford Consumer Commission from 1978 until his passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13945.939s">He</a> was a four-term governor's Councilor, and he was also chief steward at the National Association of Government Employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13952.561s">Michael</a> is sorely and sadly missed, Mr. President, just this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13957.923s">He</a> was honored up at Wrights Pond for his work <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13960.754s">in</a> protecting Wrights Pond and ensuring that that location was not turned into condominium complexes in the early to late 80s. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=13966.999s">So,</a> Mr. President, I think it's fitting that on this evening and this anniversary of the death of such a great man that the City Council adjourns in his memory.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo/2025-03-21_QuIJp-vSiqo.html">Medford City Council - December 23, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=41.282s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=43.103s">I'd</a> like to motion to suspend rule number 33 to take paper 14756 out of order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2053.988s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2055.689s">Having</a> reviewed the paperwork, I find everything in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2057.869s">I</a> feel as though this is a long overdue and much needed revitalization to a site that's been in disrepair for quite some time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2064.85s">So,</a> I'd like to second Councilor Dello Russo's motion to move for approval as amended.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2609.487s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2610.767s">Mr.</a> President, we're into suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=2612.088s">I'd</a> like to move to take paper 14795 out of order.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5837.944s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5839.164s">Chief,</a> thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5842.025s">I</a> think it's safe to say that come January, this plan is going to roll out, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5847.156s">And</a> moving forward, you know, I think that there are a lot of things that could have been done differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5852.498s">There</a> are a lot of different approaches that we could have taken to, you know, share information, to notify the public, to keep people informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5859.661s">However,</a> the stark reality of the matter is that this has happened, and this has happened in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5864.163s">This</a> has happened in just a couple of short weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5866.175s">So</a> I guess my question to you chief is, um, it is the control and the oversight responsibility of the traffic and parking commission to set the regulations, to set where the parking spots are, to set what the rates are, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5876.897s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5877.497s">And</a> the parking and the traffic and parking commission tend to meet monthly.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5896.853s">And</a> Chief, at these Traffic and Parking Commission meetings recently, I've seen the minutes and I've seen a lot of mention about this program and the rollout of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5905.879s">Moving</a> forward, do you anticipate any changes based upon what we've heard here today? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5910.081s">I</a> know that the business community has been outspoken in terms of what their wants, needs, and desires are, and it seems like the commission's responded somewhat. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5920.688s">As</a> Councilor Mark said, when this rolls out, the residents are going to have a whole new set of concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5925.758s">So,</a> you know, my question to you, I guess, would be, is once a month enough during the rollout? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=5930.802s">And</a> what can we do to improve the dialogue between the administration, the council, and the Traffic and Parking Commission going forward to address residents' concerns as they arise?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6049.58s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6049.98s">Thank</a> you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6050.42s">Appreciate</a> it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6679.71s">Have</a> you received any complaints or any concerns about locations and one business having one and one business not?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6697.077s">But</a> in terms of Joe pizza versus Espresso's pizza versus Amici's pizza, have you heard any concern about a business owner being very concerned about being treated differently or unfairly? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6705.878s">No,</a> I have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6706.759s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6713.8s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6715.52s">Point</a> of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6716.54s">I</a> was speaking to the chief in terms of as the chair of the pocket commission who has the oversight authority of the plan, who would be the official receptacle for any complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6725.811s">as</a> the chair of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6727.771s">So</a> the chair.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8588.878s">To</a> all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=8590.138s">In</a> reviewing the paperwork, I see here that it indicates that you're a sole proprietor and that you will have no employees working for you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9793.275s">Crystal</a> Campbell was a regular citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9795.336s">She</a> wasn't a veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9796.436s">She</a> wasn't a member of our armed services. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9798.217s">She</a> wasn't a military soldier in a foreign land. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=9802.018s">She</a> was an individual who went to go watch the Boston Marathon, which is one of our most historic events that we have here in the city of Medford, and she was tragically murdered by terrorists.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10270.82s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10272.961s">Lauren,</a> it's my understanding that the PAC grant application process is almost backwards, where you have to have an actual project in place, and this is what it is.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10306.979s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10308.18s">Mr.</a> President, I stated it last week, and I'll state it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10310.583s">I</a> think this is a good project. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10311.784s">It's</a> a project that I'm going to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10313.926s">I</a> feel as though it's going to be a draw to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10315.667s">It's</a> going to give people a reason to come down to Medford Square and frequent our local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10320.572s">It's</a> also going to provide the residents of the two housing authority buildings, the two affordable housing <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10326.91s">buildings</a> there, a nice place to respite. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10329.032s">It's</a> going to revitalize our waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10330.534s">It's</a> going to provide us with access to our waterfront for once. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10333.276s">And</a> we've heard the council talk time and time again about one of our most underutilized assets here in the city of Medford being the waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10339.543s">Here</a> we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10339.963s">We're</a> in a process right now of opening up an opportunity to utilize our waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10344.365s">We're</a> also looking at the plan and the improvements that the plan is going to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10347.988s">The</a> plan is going to help improve ADA compliance at the senior center and ADA compliance at certain egresses. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10355.074s">It's</a> also going to allow for multimodal transportation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10357.876s">It's</a> going to open it up to a bikeway. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10359.837s">So,</a> I really think it's a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10361.899s">It</a> beautifies an existing location. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10364.581s">And</a> more than that, I think that it's going to be a project of national significance. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10369.024s">And</a> I think if we're in a position right now to do a project of national significance, that we need to do it the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10374.392s">And</a> I'm going to wholeheartedly support this paper as filed, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10913.967s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10915.388s">I'm</a> a little confused about the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10918.751s">The</a> council is opposed to the project, but she wants to add a contingency to the project.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10927.117s">Well,</a> you just voted to reduce the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10928.938s">I</a> didn't vote against it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10931.938s">You</a> voted to reduce the funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10933.499s">Does</a> that mean I'm going to vote for or against the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10935.099s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10935.419s">That's</a> what I'm trying to clarify right now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10941.661s">Before</a> when you were opposed to the project, that wasn't on.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=10955.032s">No,</a> I'm just trying to understand the amendment to the paper.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=38.819s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=40.02s">I'd</a> like to make a motion to suspend the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=41.762s">Uh,</a> number the rule number 33 to take paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=45.766s">If</a> I can find the number of it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=54.556s">One</a> four dash seven three two.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=247.53s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=407.609s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=408.909s">I</a> believe just a couple of weeks ago, we did appropriate $1.2 million in free cash for a community improvement initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=416.112s">So</a> I do think that some of this money that came in has been voted on and has been voted to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=420.433s">And</a> it's been spent on equipment, safety issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=424.959s">and</a> a number of resolutions that this council actually sent forward to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=428.241s">Mr.</a> President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1187.084s">Mr.</a> President, I just think back to 2001 and <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1191.658s">All</a> of us that have been involved in government since that time continuously hear from the Massachusetts Municipal Association about the need to restore local aid funding back to pre-2001 levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1202.726s">We</a> have a new administration coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1204.247s">We</a> have a new governor coming to Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1206.708s">This</a> is the governor who was the chairman of, he was the secretariat of administration and finance, and he was the architect of the nine C cuts that came into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1214.073s">I</a> think that we really need to be careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1216.135s">Maybe</a> now isn't the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1217.296s">We</a> had eight years of the same administration and we knew what to expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1220.178s">Now</a> we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1221.045s">We</a> have a new administration coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1222.626s">The</a> administration historically has supported nine C cuts to local aid after a budget's been passed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1227.947s">This</a> makes me nervous, makes me very nervous to reduce the tax, to chip away at our free cash, not have reserves in the bank, and then be later on down the road, see something like this happen at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1241.351s">We</a> might be really put in a precarious position down the road if, in fact, this agenda item goes through.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=1270.094s">I</a> do believe that the council every week makes recommendations to the mayor as to what projects we'd like to see funded, as to what steps we'd like to see the government move, and as to what direction we'd like to see certain initiatives take.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2201.168s">That's</a> only provided that the gentleman's there for another 15 or seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2204.43s">And</a> I think every two years, everybody has the opportunity to, if they see fit, seek one of our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2209.374s">And</a> if they feel as though the city's going the proper course, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2212.972s">or</a> an improper course, they have every right to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2214.933s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2215.713s">But</a> I think right now, the issue before us is whether or not it's a good idea for us to reduce the tax levy by a million dollars.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2230.258s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2231.799s">I</a> believe the new governor just recently in the press has also discussed the idea of requiring municipalities to establish rainy day funds in order for <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2242.387s">them</a> to maintain strong financial footing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2401.624s">Mr.</a> President, I think it's apparent by the debate and dialogue that there are many options that we as a council and we as a city have for the utilization of the so-called certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2412.968s">However,</a> if we don't have any certified free cash, then we can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2417.51s">So</a> I think that those reserves are very important to the fiscal stability <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2420.782s">of</a> the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2421.822s">I</a> think that those reserves are something that we need to build up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2424.323s">We</a> don't need to move away from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2425.363s">I</a> think we need to be ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2426.723s">I</a> think that that's something that we can all agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2428.784s">We</a> need to be ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2429.784s">And</a> we have a lot of uncertainty coming up in the next four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2432.885s">We</a> have a new administration coming in that historically has supported making cuts to local government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2437.866s">And</a> for that reason and that reason alone, I'm voting against this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2652.358s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2652.978s">I</a> referred to Mr. Baker in his role as Secretary of the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, at which time the administration underneath Governor Romney, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2663.776s">made</a> unprecedented cuts under section 9c of the general laws, allowing them to cut local aid after the state budget has been passed, which left cities and towns in a very, very precarious position because they had already budgeted based upon figures that were provided to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2678.267s">And</a> that's why I'm a little concerned about the uncertainty of what his ideology will be, coupled with the fact that he publicly came out and supported the idea <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2690.093s">of</a> local municipalities establishing rainy day funds, and this possibly being a requirement, would lead me to believe that this is something that he's going to keep his eyes on, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2733.794s">recently</a> in the press, he's come out and spoke about the need for a rainy day fund in municipalities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3339.386s">I</a> have a question for Mr. O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3344.128s">If,</a> in fact, the levy limit set at the 2.5% increase from last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3349.74s">And</a> we're going to reduce the tax levy just by a monetary amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3354.024s">But</a> that wouldn't necessarily reduce the tax levy, correct, for next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3361.53s">An</a> excess levy or an excess levy limit?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3396.877s">And</a> then next year, if in fact we didn't do the $1 million reduction and the tax levy limit went up another 2.5%, we'd see <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3404.906s">the</a> recuperation of that million dollars that was cut as well as another 2.5% increase if in fact that was adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3411.13s">That's</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3412.43s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3457.238s">So</a> next year, when the tax rates set, that figure at $96 million or five is still the levy limit plus the 2.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3463.039s">The</a> levy limit doesn't go down to $95 million.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3474.781s">No,</a> it comes off the money collected for the 2.5%.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3486.497s">But</a> the percentage stays the same, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3488.118s">I</a> mean, it wouldn't change the tax levy from 2.5% to whatever the factor would be, minus the million. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3494.504s">The</a> levy stays at the 2.5% exclusion, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3515.324s">But</a> next year, when you open the tax levy, it's going to include that million that was just cut plus the additional 2.5% on top of the 96 million.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3528.834s">So</a> it's safe to say that if, in fact, there's no reduction in the levy limit next year, that people see an increase of this million dollars that we're pushing, that we're not going to be spending <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3542.15s">Right,</a> but it still stays in the levy limit for next year for when they collect.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=3562.741s">Right,</a> but what I'm saying is the levy limit right now as proposed would be $96.5 million, right?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4241.417s">If</a> I understand the dialogue, Mr. President, I think, um, what the assessor is trying to indicate is that the tax levy is set every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4249.084s">And</a> when this tax rate and tax levy is set, that's when the exemption is taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4254.126s">If</a> this happens semi-annually, this is something that DSS is not going to take up until the next tax cycle?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4265.112s">So</a> if, in fact, the residential exemption wasn't <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=4267.86s">wasn't</a> passed this evening, and the council wanted to implement a residential tax exemption six months down the road, and we voted for it, that wouldn't take effect until the next time that you're before us to set the levy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5415.973s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5417.053s">And</a> my question really revolved around the cyclical inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5420.394s">And,</a> you know, give or take, we're about halfway complete with the residential and the commercial properties here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5426.435s">Do</a> you have any facts or figures relative to the number of people that have jumped from below the break-even to over the break-even through the cyclical inspections?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5465.955s">8%</a> over market or something right now in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5468.236s">Pardon</a> me? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5468.996s">Medford's</a> over market at this point in almost double digits in terms of sales, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5472.937s">Correct.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5522.691s">Thank</a> you, Mr. O'Neill.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5772.965s">Mr.</a> President, we're under suspension.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6451.485s">Mr.</a> Brian, um, can, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6454.384s">Can</a> you just tell us a little bit about how you're liking it and how it's working out? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6457.685s">And</a> other than this ordinance, are there any other things that you guys have been working on? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6461.206s">I</a> know November was National Disability Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6464.646s">Diane</a> and I spoke at length about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6467.127s">And</a> I'd just like to maybe hear a little bit about your experiences being on the committee and how you like it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=6536.393s">Excellent,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7066.438s">Can</a> you say that again, please, Councilor?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7069.82s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7071.001s">As</a> I read it, it says five members of the commission shall constitute a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7074.322s">No</a> binding decision shall be made at any meeting at which not enough members are present to constitute a quorum when enough members operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7080.005s">Okay,</a> so I see what you're saying, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=7082.14s">A</a> vote of three of five could constitute a majority vote as opposed to a vote of five of nine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9294.604s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9296.626s">It</a> was very interesting and informative presentation that was given at the committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9302.229s">One</a> of the things that jumped out at me was the fact that with the passage of this project will be multiple ADA improvements down at the senior center and multiple ADA compliance improvements down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9314.206s">Absent</a> this project, I don't think that these improvements are going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9317.787s">I</a> think that these ADA compliance improvements are vital based upon the location alone of where the Peace Garden is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9325.371s">It's</a> located between two facilities that house elderly and disabled individuals in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9330.713s">Also,</a> I think that it will beautify the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9334.274s">It</a> will give people a reason to come and to stop and to stay and to sit, and it will begin to create a revitalization and a utilization of our waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9342.221s">which</a> is something that this council talks about frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9344.142s">We</a> have a very underutilized asset here in Medford, and that's our waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9347.884s">And</a> I think we need to give people a reason to come to our downtown business districts and a reason to stay in our downtown business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9354.187s">You</a> know, I certainly like the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9356.227s">I</a> think that it provides improvements for accessibility, but it also provides improvements for a cycling community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9361.95s">It</a> puts bicycle racks in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9364.111s">It's</a> accessible to be accessed through multimodal transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9369.217s">Mr.</a> President, I think this is a good expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=9370.917s">It's</a> something that I'm going to be supporting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10155.296s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10157.052s">And</a> I can certainly understand the concerns that my colleagues raise about a maintenance plan, a perpetual care at the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10163.534s">However,</a> I want to point out that this isn't Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10166.014s">It's</a> not Placed at Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10166.894s">It's</a> not even Barry Park, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10168.415s">This</a> location is the size of a large backyard in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10172.516s">And</a> the city owns a portion of the space now and does provide maintenance and upkeep to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10177.457s">So</a> the only major expense that's going to be outside of the ordinary, in my opinion, would be the fountain. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10183.378s">And</a> I don't think that the maintenance and upkeep of a fountain is going to change the scope <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10187.375s">of</a> what's being done there right now too drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10191.136s">So,</a> you know, I certainly understand the concerns about a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10194.197s">I</a> think that these concerns are warranted, but I think they're warranted when we're looking at projects that are on a much larger scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10199.379s">I</a> know there is an expenditure of, you know, $1.1 million to construct this, but I think that the ends are going to justify the means, and I think that the benefits are going to fire away the costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10212.104s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10213.484s">May</a> I also add that I feel as <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10215.659s">fitting</a> tribute to those that were lost in the Boston Marathon bombing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10220.283s">And</a> I also am proud to be a part of the community that's going to have the largest scale monument to that tragedy to date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10370.739s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10373.2s">I</a> didn't know what we were voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10374.0s">I</a> thought we were voting on the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10374.881s">I</a> apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10375.461s">It</a> was my error. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10376.201s">As</a> a matter of fact, I'll move for reconsideration after the vote, if need be, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10901.813s">Merry</a> Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10902.593s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10904.914s">I</a> look back to some of my notes, and I have here resolution dated 09-803 brought forward by my colleague, Councilor Penta, relative to the creation of an excessive water use program, which passed unanimously by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10920.919s">Again,</a> in 2010, Councilor Penta, implementation of a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10926.006s">Paper</a> number 12720. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10928.507s">So</a> I think that this is something that's not uncommon and not unheard of, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=10932.209s">I</a> went back and I, I, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11004.605s">Councilor,</a> did I hear that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11007.648s">Again,</a> like I said, Councilor Penter, I mean, Councilor Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11012.844s">I</a> have here at least eight resolutions that was put forth by past city councils over the last seven years that would ask for the implementation of a tiered water rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11023.788s">The</a> administration responded to recommendations made by the council over a seven-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11029.59s">I'm</a> scratching my head on this one a little bit, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11032.331s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11364.785s">Again,</a> I kind of concur with Councilor Lungo-Koehn in her assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11369.008s">You</a> know, there is a paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11369.849s">It's</a> the same exact paper that's in committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11372.371s">90</a> days haven't passed since that paper was disposed of by this council and no report from that committee has been issued forthwith to the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11378.116s">So</a> I don't think this is a matter that should be appropriate for discussion at this point in time based upon our internal rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11383.581s">However,</a> I mean, I'm not going to challenge the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11385.443s">I'm</a> not going to raise a question, a question of rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11387.585s">I</a> just think that <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11389.2s">We're</a> looking at this, and we have a set of rules that we're agreeing to live by. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11392.502s">We</a> voted to suspend rule 33 today to take items out of order, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11396.545s">It</a> says, if a matter is disposed of, 90 days before it comes back to the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11402.01s">We</a> have the paper that's still in subcommittee, and the subcommittee hasn't reported on any findings, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11406.073s">I</a> think that this is where that discussion should take place.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11472.225s">Public</a> participation in the agenda.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11609.345s">I</a> am aware that they do have public computers at the Medford Public Library that's accessible, and people are allowed to use them there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11615.509s">It's</a> just a point of information if anybody's interested.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gvpawZbv1GQ/2025-03-21_gvpawZbv1GQ.html">Medford City Council - December 9, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2106.172s">I</a> have nothing to add, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2107.212s">The</a> microphone was on, but.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3468.928s">All</a> those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3470.089s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3471.21s">Point</a> of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3472.671s">Um,</a> last week we discussed the cyclical reevaluation process that's in place and um, Assessor O'Neill did have, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3483.496s">get</a> back to us and I was hoping that he'd be able to provide the general public with an update as to where we are in the revaluation cycle in terms of the DOI mandated process that needs to take place.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3562.345s">Um,</a> Mr. O'Neill, thank you very much for getting back to the council in such a timely fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3567.709s">Um,</a> in terms of the appellate tax book cases that are out there, pending is, uh, those cases handled internally or as outside council hired, uh, uh, the board of assessors, uh, tries to handle and negotiate those internally.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3592.386s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3592.686s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3593.627s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3594.167s">You're</a> welcome.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3928.845s">Once</a> construction starts, do you know how long this project is going to take?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=3939.932s">And</a> do you anticipate this project being done in the winter months or in the spring months?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4172.719s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4173.92s">I</a> also want to take the opportunity to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4175.601s">Murphy,</a> because last time she appeared before the Council, I raised some concerns that I had relative to a sidewalk and a street repair between Smith Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4183.346s">and</a> Hicks Ave., which is the subject of a resolution that I'm going to be bringing up this evening under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4188.489s">And</a> although Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4189.49s">Murphy</a> works, from what I can tell, in the distribution of electricity, within a week, they were out there and they had fixed the street from Hicks Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4196.754s">to</a> Smith Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4197.315s">and</a> repaired it into its natural and pristine condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4199.716s">So,</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4200.837s">Murphy,</a> I want to thank you for your efforts on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4202.935s">because</a> it was two days later that I drove down the street and I saw the sawhorses out there and they were ready to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4207.98s">So</a> thank you very much for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4209.461s">And</a> I trust that if you were able to do something with the 37% increase in the electrical bill, in the two or three days from now, we'd probably see it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4217.508s">So</a> thank you very much for your past work on behalf of this council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4273.779s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4275.12s">I</a> was recently contacted by a number of members of the laborers union who are working on a project in Harvard square and they reside in Medford and they walk down to Medford square city hall and they get on the bus to take that bus to Harvard square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4289.262s">because</a> parking is such a hassle over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4292.484s">And</a> it's been brought to my attention that usually on Thursdays and Saturdays, the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4297.266s">bus</a> fails to make a stop at the City Hall stop, Mr. President, resulting in these individuals being late for work or having to take taxis to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4307.632s">I</a> think the reason that this happens is because of the way the route's structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4311.094s">It</a> has to go past, you know, the old Tony Lucci's, take a left down river, come back past City Hall Plaza, and then do the loop again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4317.647s">So</a> maybe in the interest of time, some of these drivers are bypassing a certain stop that may or may not be busy all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4324.292s">However,</a> it's had an impact on these hardworking individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4327.475s">So</a> I'd like a letter to be sent out to the MVTA to be sure that their drivers are made aware of the fact that that is a stop and that that's a stop that means a lot to the residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4337.703s">It's</a> a publicized stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4338.824s">It's</a> on their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4339.525s">It's</a> on their route. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4340.165s">So</a> it's a stop that they should be making.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4345.61s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5146.19s">As</a> I alluded to earlier in the meeting, National Grid is doing some gas line repairs along the stretch of Main Street between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5155.992s">And</a> over the last couple of days, they've ripped up several sidewalk slabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5161.254s">However,</a> they've ripped up sidewalk slabs on either side of the street from Smith down to Hicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5166.735s">which</a> would make it very difficult for a person in a wheelchair, a person with a cane, to walk down the street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5172.76s">Also,</a> whereas Hicks Ave is the entrance to the Columbus School, I feel as though this may pose a risk to the students that are looking to walk to school, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5180.347s">So</a> I'm asking that our office of disability take a look and make sure that the project specifications meet ADA compliance for an accessible pathway for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5189.198s">who</a> might have to traverse that road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5191.559s">I'd</a> also ask that her findings be reported to the school department to ensure that Mr. Belson's well aware of this safety situation down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5199.742s">I</a> would leave it to the Office of Disability to determine whether or not they feel as though a police detail is going to be needed down there during the construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5206.364s">At</a> this point in time, I don't have any inkling of understanding as to how long this project's gonna take. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5211.826s">I</a> do know that I personally saw at least 12 sidewalk slabs on either side of the street torn up, so I don't think this is a one-day project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5218.715s">And</a> based upon the weather that we're going to receive and have been receiving, I don't think this is going to be something that's going to be done in a fashion that's going to be suitable for a longterm solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5226.479s">If</a> in fact they do get out there to plug these holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5228.941s">Um,</a> so I'm asking that, um, miss McLeod and our office of disability take a look and, uh, make sure that, you know, the, the contractor out there is in compliance with the federal law on the motion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5268.539s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5270.019s">I</a> think that, uh, this fine scholar athletes accolades speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5274.281s">Uh,</a> she was the MVP of the greater Boston league this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5277.943s">She</a> led her team to the GBL championship title for the girls soccer team here at Medford high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5283.465s">And</a> she was also, um, asking Boston Herald Oskalastic, which is one of the highest accolades that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5289.05s">a</a> high school athlete can achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5291.131s">I</a> think that she joins the ranks of some other great Medford athletes like Sean Bates, Jake Perrazzo, and Brittany Lanzilli to be named Boston Herald All Scholastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5301.176s">So</a> I think it would be fitting to invite her down here to receive a council accommodation and to offer her our congratulations on her great effort and great representation of the student athletes in Medford High School.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5332.47s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5333.731s">This</a> falls in line with what we did over the spring when we had the rowing team up here who was GBL champions for both the boys and the girls teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5341.234s">I</a> think that it's nice to see our scholar athletes being so successful on the field and in the classroom, and I think it's only fitting that we bring them down here and recognize their achievement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5369.996s">Again,</a> Mr. President, as I just stated before, I think it's great to see such success on the field and also in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5375.2s">These</a> student athletes are a great representation of the city of Medford and our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5379.953s">and</a> I think that it would be fitting to bring them down here and recognize their achievement.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5405.523s">Mr.</a> President, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5407.38s">In</a> recent months past, we've had a licensing committee meeting to discuss the rates for taxicabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5411.804s">We've</a> had a number of license requests come by before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5415.868s">I</a> think that it's important, Mr. President, that if in fact we are going to be issuing these licenses, that we make sure that these operators are in compliance with our rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5423.134s">There's</a> been a lot of discussion about the implementation of a taxicab ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5427.378s">But</a> at this point in time, I'm going to withdraw this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5429.74s">I'd</a> like Councilor Marks to be here because he's expressed a number of issues of concern that he has. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5434.063s">So</a> I'd like to withdraw the matter, and I'll refile it at a later date.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5674.508s">I</a> received correspondence from the Chamber of Commerce inviting me to come, gave me a list of all the dates that it was coming, that it was going to be held and locations and times, emailed right to my inbox.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5801.105s">I</a> believe, I believe consulate Dello Russo voted in favor of a resolution asking Republic to come to each individual business district here in the city to present an information session with the business owners and the residents thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5814.373s">He</a> voted in support of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5815.874s">The</a> resolution was brought forward maybe seven weeks ago and it passed six to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5819.616s">Um,</a> so I think that when you say have a voice, consulate Dello Russo did have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5823.34s">He</a> used his voice here as a councilor to speak about his position on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5826.482s">What's</a> going on in the Chamber of Commerce and this private organization and the private decisions that they make really has no effect on what we do here as a council.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6069.884s">Um,</a> it seems like Republic's willing to do some outreach work, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6074.769s">If</a> they're willing to come and meet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6110.085s">I</a> mean, Mr. President, it's clear, I think, that republic's willing to do some outreach work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6114.831s">We've</a> seen them at community day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6116.313s">We've</a> seen them at a number of events that have gone on that the city sponsored. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6119.597s">Now</a> we're seeing them take the efforts to go and meet with the chamber of commerce, not on one night, not on two nights, not on three nights, but on four nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6125.484s">So</a> I think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6128.565s">I'd</a> be remiss if I didn't say that maybe we should just call Republic and ask them to put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6133.332s">And</a> if we have any constituents that have contacted us, we can have the same type of info session in room 201 or room 207.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6145.464s">I</a> mean, they've been there, they've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6146.805s">I</a> think they've answered our questions for the most part.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6156.934s">In</a> terms of their track record and what they've shown us that they're willing to do, I don't think that there'd be any reason to think that they wouldn't be willing to continue to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6164.88s">I</a> think that it might make sense if we can reach out to <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6168.604s">find</a> out who the City of Medford liaison is, and then we can deal with these things on a case-by-case basis with that individual directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6174.408s">If</a> we needed to put them in a room with 10 or 11 or 13 people, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6177.671s">If</a> business owners are calling you and they need answers, I don't think that this gentleman is going to be too afraid to come up here and give answers to the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6184.816s">The</a> contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6185.657s">He</a> is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6188.159s">At</a> the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6189.987s">He's</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6190.247s">We're</a> going to have to live with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6191.328s">So</a> I don't think that they're going to want to start off on the wrong foot and create a relationship like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6196.551s">I</a> really think that based on what they've shown us already, that they're willing to be a part of the conversation, to come in and to talk and to answer the questions and to show us how they want to implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6205.896s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, you know, I'd certainly be interested to find out what the contact information is for the liaison for Republic so that I can go and do some of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6216.378s">Um,</a> I don't need an official action to this council to get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6218.881s">I</a> can make the, make the full call and do it my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6221.644s">Um,</a> however, I think that that might make a little bit more sense than, than, you know, it'll get us some results. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6227.37s">It'll</a> bring us, it'll bring us to the end of the road yet.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6266.37s">I</a> have it right here.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6769.016s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6769.916s">I</a> don't think we need to name the gentleman by name over here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6772.837s">That's</a> inappropriate.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6785.716s">I</a> just don't think it's conducive to a positive debate.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU/2025-03-21_gmU8To7cLAU.html">Medford City Council - December 2, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=104.423s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=105.904s">The</a> platties have been longtime family friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=108.363s">I</a> had the pleasure of meeting Irene and her son Joe during my time as an aide to Charlie Shannon in the state Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=114.506s">Since</a> that time we developed a great friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=117.067s">Irene</a> was a dedicated public service, a dedicated public servant. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=120.989s">She</a> spent a number of years as a cafeteria worker here in the city of Medford and we offer our deepest condolences to the family.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2026.844s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2028.224s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2030.485s">I</a> think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2031.746s">It's</a> a great proactive approach to revitalizing our downtown business area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2036.087s">One</a> of the things that I've seen in a lot of other communities is almost like a wall that would speak to the history of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2041.749s">And</a> I think when we look at, you know, the Salem Street Burial Ground and the history that Medford Square has, that would be a perfect purpose for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2048.828s">You</a> know, if you see some of the things that we've done in our community here in Medford, we have a library that they opened up in West Medford Square, and it's just an open-air library, a box. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2058.95s">Simple,</a> put a book in, take a book out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2061.23s">Something</a> like that would be a great idea down there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2063.21s">I'm</a> really impressed with Councilor Mark's foresight in bringing this matter to the table, and I'm wholeheartedly in support of it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=2070.152s">I</a> think this is a great idea.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3264.402s">I</a> think it would also be helpful, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3266.982s">I</a> remember, I think back in January, the city began doing a real property inspection and valuation program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3275.409s">And</a> it said it was going to take about 24 months to complete the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gmU8To7cLAU&t=3278.551s">I'd</a> like to know where we are in terms of the reevaluation of the properties that have been inspected, how many houses have been done, how many houses need to be done before we move forward on the tax rate.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_UuOesa_m9wQ/2025-03-21_UuOesa_m9wQ.html">Medford City Council - November 25, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=408.412s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=410.836s">In</a> looking at the packet that we have this morning, I have noticed that the Bicycle Commission and members thereof who are here present this evening have provided us with some information relative to where it is they would like to see these bike paths. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=422.023s">And</a> we also have a correspondence from the Mayor's Office, and this correspondence would indicate that the Traffic and Parking Commission will have the actual oversight authority over the bicycle lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=431.615s">I</a> think one of the important components of this funding that we released last week, Mr. President, is the fact that it's also going to be used to provide educational information and educational materials to the residents in the city of Medford so that they understand that these cyclists do have rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=443.785s">And</a> part of those rights involve sharing the road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=446.647s">Again,</a> I think this is a great initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=448.308s">I</a> think this is a step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=449.83s">I</a> think it's forward thinking on behalf of the administration, on behalf of this council, to vote to release this money, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=455.194s">I</a> stand in support of bicycle lanes here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=458.126s">I'd</a> like to thank the members of the bicycle commission who took time out of their busy schedule during this holiday season to come out here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=463.33s">Thank</a> you very much.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1110.923s">We've</a> seen other cities, Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, you've seen articles in the newspaper, you've seen reports online about police actually enforcing the rules of the road and writing tickets to cyclists and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1122.873s">I</a> think it's safe to say that Medford in terms of its commitment to the cycling community is a little bit behind some of our neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1129.398s">And</a> I guess my question to you is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1131.155s">what</a> steps can the council take proactively to be in a position to have a successful rollout of bicycle lanes and also successful enforcement of the rules of the road? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1141.8s">And</a> what changes would you like to see take place here in the city that will address some of the concerns that have come up during your commission meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1148.504s">Because</a> from what I can tell you of a rather large commission that meets rather frequently, you have quite a active and involved group of people that are participating on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1156.108s">So</a> I'm sure there are a number of great ideas that have been brought up, a number of great ideas that have been hashed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1161.421s">And</a> I was wondering maybe if you could provide some direction to this council as to what you'd like to see happen, what might make for a smooth transition, and what might ensure that this idea comes to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1173.124s">And</a> when it does, that we're in the best possible place to succeed.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1780.336s">Councilor</a> Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1781.902s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1784.063s">Again,</a> I'm certainly supportive of the bike lanes and looking at it and seeing the bigger picture and thinking down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1790.727s">I</a> mean, we know these bicycle lanes are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1792.428s">We</a> know that this is probably only going to be the beginning of these bicycle lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1796.31s">And</a> I was just wondering if maybe the ultimate vision that the commission has is to try to tie these lanes into the paths in Somerville and the path in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1804.778s">So</a> that we can have a safe route for people to traverse from Medford to the Somerville bike path, from Medford to the Arlington bike path, or down the Arlington bike path to Somerville, back from Somerville and through Medford, and right back to where it started. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1816.946s">So</a> again, Mr. President, I'm very supportive of this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1820.629s">I</a> think that in looking at the work that they've done in such a short period of time, it's amazing, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1825.612s">They're</a> really showing that although government's designed to move slowly, it doesn't necessarily have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1830.035s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1884.522s">have</a> you sought any guidance from maybe the Massachusetts Area Planning Council or any other state agencies that have some control over the way that transportation funding is released and that infrastructure improvements are released, or is that still a little bit found on the line for you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1897.108s">I</a> mean, we went from having nothing to having bicycle lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1900.49s">Next</a> thing you know, now we're talking about tying it into the Greenway and into the parks and stuff like that, so I can see a big vision and a big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=1907.313s">And</a> I was wondering how far along in the process you guys actually are.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2409.577s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2410.958s">When</a> you say a barrier, Councilor Marks, what I envision is like coming down Fulton Street on Ridgeway Road, like a couple of Jersey barriers that are up with a sign that says resident accidents only. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=2419.725s">What</a> exactly do you mean when you're saying a barrier in terms of, you know, what you'd like to see put up?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3062.902s">I'm</a> constant president commercial I'd like to further amend the paper to have the city councilor invited the developer to a committee of the whole meeting to present his plans to the council and <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3072.924s">so</a> that we can ask some questions face to face with the individuals who are putting this plan forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3322.503s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3323.963s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3325.483s">Chief,</a> now you said that you're working on building up the reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3327.984s">How</a> does the reserve system work? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3329.084s">Is</a> there a substitute list? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3330.305s">Is</a> there a per diem rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3332.645s">How</a> does it work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3385.864s">I</a> think, um, you know, regardless of the amount of time that they're out there, it's a very important job, a very vital job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3390.825s">I</a> certainly have no problem with putting them through a, you know, intense vetting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3395.326s">Um,</a> a suggestion chief, one of the things that I've seen work at in other communities, um, when I, when I was representing city workers, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3402.633s">was</a> a per diem list that they used, and they'd call in retirees who had served in the position before, who had already gone through the vetting process, who had already served in the position before, been trained at it, had passed a CORI check, and brought them in on a per diem basis, almost like an O3 contract employee that the state uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3417.914s">So</a> just a suggestion, Chief, in looking at maybe a short-term solution would be maybe contacting some of the retirees so you don't need to go through the process of training and the process of vetting as intensely as you would somebody that's new. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3427.6s">But</a> people retire for a reason, I know.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3496.955s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3497.975s">Um,</a> Mr. President and a city clerk Finn will be able to attest to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3501.716s">Um,</a> over the past several weeks he and I have been going back and forth and uh, it was my intention to file a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3507.367s">And</a> this resolution would be that the city clerk provide us with a list of all the positions that fall into the purview of the council for appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3514.46s">And</a> the purpose that he would provide us with this list is for us to determine what the actual job description of these positions would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3520.004s">And</a> also establish a performance evaluation tool to determine whether or not the employees that are actually in these positions are meeting the objectives and the goals that we set forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3528.77s">So</a> while I do appreciate your resolution this morning and your recommendation, I think that it might be a good idea for us to take a look at the actual role and function of our representative on the MBELT board. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3540.479s">Maybe</a> take a look at what exactly it is that we'd expect of them to report back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3544.624s">And</a> maybe if there's a meeting schedule, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3547.588s">Certain</a> requirements and protocols that we'd like to see take place so that we're sure that we're being informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3552.954s">Furthermore,</a> I also <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3555.282s">I'm</a> not aware whether or not it's a requirement that a member of this council has to be the appointee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3560.346s">And</a> that might be something else that we would like to discuss, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3563.067s">Maybe</a> someone that this council as a body can agree on to serve on the in-built board, because we're torn in a lot of different directions at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3570.252s">Appointing</a> one of us to that board may not necessarily meet the goals and objectives that we set forth for the position, just based upon time and attention and the ability to really focus on it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3582.04s">So</a> with that being said, at this point in time, I'm going to be filing a contrary resolution, Mr. President, in the coming weeks to bring this stuff up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3589.423s">So</a> I'd ask that the matter be tabled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3596.726s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3598.507s">Roll</a> call has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3599.887s">And</a> this is nothing against the job of Councilor Penn for the job that he's done in the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3604.015s">I</a> just think that, you know, it's very important for us to take a look at what exactly it is expected of these people that are coming under our purview time and time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3611.32s">We</a> reappoint people to positions, but there's really no measuring stick. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3614.383s">There's</a> no best practice that's in place here for us to determine whether or not we're getting what we need to get in terms of information.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3757.387s">It's</a> no reflection on the job that you're doing, Councilor Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3760.809s">As</a> a matter of fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3765.178s">I</a> don't think that you're doing a bad job at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3767.46s">My</a> question was, let's determine what exactly it is we're looking for out of the individual that's in this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3772.364s">Now,</a> we have some legislative enabling language that's in there that's going to speak to that, and that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3776.888s">But</a> we also have other positions that fall under the purview of this council, and it's not just necessarily the end belt appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3782.573s">And</a> if we're going to do it, we should do it at one time, and we should do it for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3785.436s">I</a> don't think we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3786.917s">the</a> clerk, the messenger, the home-health stadium appointee, the in-belt appointee at separate times, I think it would make more sense for us to sit down and to establish a best practice for this council and a best practice for the way that we're gonna continue to do business in terms of these appointments that fall under Rapperview. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3802.09s">Really,</a> that's the intent of the resolution that I am intending to file. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3806.253s">It</a> hasn't been filed yet, so at this point in time, the only matter that's before us is Councilor Camuso's resolution that he filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3812.478s">He</a> has a recommendation on the floor and I've removed <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3816.46s">my</a> objection or my motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3819.825s">I</a> certainly think that the matter should be tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3821.948s">I'm</a> going to vote against the resolution this evening because I feel as though it should be tabled and for the reasons that I set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3827.736s">However,</a> please don't take this as an attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3830.861s">Councilor,</a> I don't think you're doing a bad job, but I think you're doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3833.734s">Certainly,</a> I think that it falls under the purview and the responsibility of this council for someone to be serving on that body. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3838.675s">I</a> just think that I'd like to have a little bit more information going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3842.777s">I</a> certainly have taken a look at the master plan that the Shepard Brooks M-Belt group has put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3848.558s">It's</a> a great plan, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3849.719s">It</a> looks like it's something that they put a lot of time and effort into. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3852.719s">It's</a> something that I couldn't support in terms of bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3855.18s">But</a> that's a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3856.64s">My</a> question really is the representation, the best practices that are in place, the job description, and how we actually evaluate performance and measure performance of the people that we're actually recommending to go into these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3866.302s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3866.682s">No</a> more than that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3964.582s">The</a> positions that I was looking at, and the reason why I haven't brought the resolution forward is because we're still working on determining what other positions, based on past practice and past legislative action, actually falls under our scope, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3976.651s">And</a> that's really why I haven't brought the measure forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3978.652s">I</a> mean, you can ask the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3980.193s">I</a> think, Edwin, that I bring this up maybe June, July, even before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3984.456s">So</a> this is something that we've been working on and going back and forth on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3987.358s">But</a> again, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3988.807s">it's</a> a resolution when I bring it, if I, when I, when in fact I do bring the matter forward, it can be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3993.091s">Um,</a> you know, I was looking at the positions of the whole mail commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3996.934s">I</a> was looking at the position of the M belt. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=3998.515s">I</a> was looking at the position of the city messenger, the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4000.797s">Those</a> were the four that were glaring to me in terms of appointments that are under the purview of the council people that are actually appointed to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4008.423s">Um,</a> so, you know, Councilor, I'm all for that debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4011.186s">Um,</a> you know, I will bring this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4013.288s">Um,</a> I'll bring it forward sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4015.668s">However,</a> I don't want that to hold up the resolution that's before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4019.472s">So,</a> you know, with that being said, I think I've talked ad nauseum on this as to where I'm coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4024.176s">I</a> certainly appreciate and can, you know, understand where you're coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4028.0s">I</a> mean, if there are going to be criteria in place, there should be criteria in place, and I have no problem with that.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4246.638s">Mr.</a> Clerk, for the reasons that I stated forthwith, I'd like to see a performance evaluation measure and a job description for positions underneath the city council purview.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4446.378s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4447.839s">In</a> similar <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4449.852s">substance,</a> I recently got a call from some residents who are residing on Placetet Road and they expressed concern over the big sweep and the amount of leaves that have built up in and outside Oak Grove Cemetery, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=4462.418s">So</a> I'd like to amend the resolution also to ask that the leaves on both sides of the fence at Oak Grove Cemetery abutting Placetet Road be removed prior to the conclusion of the big sweep.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5063.569s">I</a> think that's the purpose of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5064.71s">Maybe</a> we should just go to the meeting and figure out, ask the question right there to the people that are the ones presenting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5124.43s">I</a> think the valid question is whether or not it's on city property, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UuOesa_m9wQ&t=5126.911s">Because</a> if it was.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w/2025-03-21_IndO1QdhX3w.html">Medford City Council - November 18, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=44.278s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like to move for suspension to take paper number. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=54.004s">Bear</a> with me, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=54.684s">14-000.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=75.198s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=75.979s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=76.359s">I</a> got it off the wrong sheet there. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=77.6s">Uh,</a> 14 7 4 3.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=986.232s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Mayne. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=988.233s">If</a> we look at the text of the paper, we'll see that there is an item in there, plans for HDQT renovations. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=994.777s">And</a> I believe that that is an appropriation of $17,000 to take a look at a design for a female locker room for our women officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1003.402s">I</a> did see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1003.903s">There's</a> also some other.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1007.084s">Commitment</a> in there for, if you can let me give me a second to take a look at my notes.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1013.972s">The</a> evidence as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1014.833s">That's</a> going to include the evidence room and moving the fire engines out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1022.237s">You're</a> correct.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1427.494s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1429.895s">I</a> was able to speak with some members of the administration prior to tonight's committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1434.86s">And</a> I also attended the Committee of the Whole meeting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1437.501s">And</a> based upon what's presented, I think this is a very good plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1440.182s">I</a> think if we look at what's before us here, we have a paper that provides for 15 vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1446.004s">It</a> provides for a number of equipment upgrades and a number of infrastructure upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1450.666s">It</a> addresses some flooding issues that are really bothering some residents and creating some problems for their personal property. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1457.208s">Technology</a> upgrades, there's some parks and recreation upgrades, public safety upgrades, a commitment to, a continued commitment to the arts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1464.366s">Overall,</a> I think this is a great package. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1465.769s">I</a> can understand how some of the councils would want to go through this one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1469.717s">However,</a> my view after attending the two meetings, having discussions with it prior to tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1474.87s">And</a> taking a look at the comprehensive package, I really think it's a nice deal for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1480.131s">It's</a> a great way to invest in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1481.952s">I</a> mean, we're looking at 15 vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1483.652s">We're</a> looking at security cameras, which this council has requested before. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1487.453s">Movable</a> speed bumps that can be placed in certain areas of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1491.073s">Mr.</a> President, LED conversion to lights that are going to be more energy efficient and brighter in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1496.234s">So</a> I really think that this is a good plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=1499.515s">I'm</a> going to be supporting it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2686.821s">as</a> opposed to, I move for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2689.353s">In</a> hindsight, looking at it now, I probably should have <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2691.907s">move</a> for suspension of Rule 33. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2693.447s">However,</a> I didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2694.728s">So</a> we can take a vote, whatever you guys want to do about a vote as to what was under suspension and what wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2700.489s">The</a> motion that I put forward was a motion to suspend the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2702.769s">That's</a> what I put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2704.45s">In</a> hindsight, would I have liked to put a motion to suspend Rule Number 33?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2762.36s">There</a> was a motion to sever that failed, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2764.141s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2764.482s">So</a> now, if this item comes back onto the table, that motion is still in play. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2769.286s">It's</a> already failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2770.007s">The</a> motion to sever has already failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2771.168s">So</a> are we going to be able to get to our, you know, is the council going to be able to get to his end result at the end of the day, if he even does withdraw? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=2778.754s">I</a> mean, are we still going to be able to go back now and undo that vote?

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7616.221s">Both</a> of them next week? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7616.941s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7617.161s">And</a> how long from start to finish do you think it will take once you break the ground over?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7624.183s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7624.423s">Do</a> you have a traffic management plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7626.424s">Yes,</a> submitted to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7628.005s">Excellent,</a> thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7629.405s">Mr.</a> President, I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=7631.146s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8390.442s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8392.043s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8393.424s">I</a> think it would be important to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8396.293s">I</a> think it was three years ago the nativity scene was removed from Royal House Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8400.594s">And</a> the reason that the nativity scene was removed from Royal House Park was because people kept stealing the caricatures that were there with the nativity scene. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8410.655s">So</a> I think it's very important that if we are going to in fact have the nativity scene put back out that we also ask the residents in our good city to respect it and to leave it alone and to leave baby Jesus in the manger and to leave the three wise men in their position. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8424.238s">Point</a> well taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8425.488s">you</a> know, providing their gifts, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8427.469s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=8427.81s">Point</a> well taken.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9246.741s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9248.162s">I</a> bring this resolution forward after driving down the streets of Medford and seeing a lot of work being done by private contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9254.608s">by</a> sitting here and approving a number of permit requests for private contractors to go and tear up our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9259.37s">If</a> we read item one underneath the city engineer's comments on a number of these requests for petitions for permits, it will say that the roadways are going to be restored back to city of Medford standards based on the rules and regulations that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9272.135s">Mr.</a> President, I'd like the council to have a copy of those so we can hold these contractors accountable so that when they put the ground back in place and they pack up their tools and that they leave, <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=9280.525s">that</a> they're leaving the city in pristine condition just like they were when they found it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10247.839s">I</a> believe that every week we send resolutions forward to the mayor asking him to do certain things that we'd like to see done, which I think would serve as a benchmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10258.083s">or</a> an understanding as to where the council is coming from, what type of initiatives that they'd like to see done, what direction that they'd like to see the mayor's office move in, in terms of this type of expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10266.845s">We'll</a> look at LED lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10268.085s">That's</a> something that the council put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10269.866s">We</a> look at security cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10270.986s">That's</a> something the council has put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10272.326s">We've</a> looked at the issue of crosswalks and speed bumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10274.307s">That's</a> something the council has put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10276.087s">So</a> I just wanted to make sure that we're all clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IndO1QdhX3w&t=10278.027s">Mr.</a> President, I rest.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=455.055s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=456.556s">I've</a> reviewed the paperwork, and I find everything to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=459.018s">I've</a> had conversations with Attorney Abruzzi and also with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=463.582s">Pierce</a> relative to requiring a police detail, especially for the Black Friday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=469.147s">And</a> they've been willing to accommodate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=472.069s">So</a> I'd be willing to move for approval, provided that we amend the paper to require a police detail on Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=478.634s">And</a> I think that it might be a good idea to have a 90-day review, whereas this is an open-ended allowance.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1159.242s">The</a> Press Thank you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1163.286s">Would</a> Kohl's be amenable to providing the dates that they would like to be open? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1169.095s">say</a> maybe the day following Veterans Day to the Chief of Police, would that be enough time? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=1173.036s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2608.657s">Mr.</a> President, in looking at the language that we have here, we have a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2612.401s">90-day</a> review is about March 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2615.484s">If</a> we amend the language to say there's an annual 90-day review upon the conclusion of the issue of the hours, I don't understand what the problem would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2623.121s">Why</a> don't we just amend the 90-day review to be an annual 90-day review? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2626.003s">It</a> has to take place before March 25th annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2628.425s">If</a> it doesn't take place before March 25th annually, the permit remains. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2631.186s">It's</a> fine.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2638.451s">Further,</a> Mr. President, I've made a number of phone calls to Mr. Bruese about this issue, and he's been more than responsive and more than willing to address some of the concerns that I had before we came to this meeting this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2647.097s">So</a> I don't have any reason to believe that that wouldn't continue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2749.117s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2749.477s">Meadow</a> Glen Mall has detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2750.298s">That</a> was my amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2751.959s">That</a> was my amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2752.919s">And</a> when I watch the news and I see what happens down in Alabama and Oklahoma on Black Friday, when droves of people push their way through the door and kill workers at Walmart and kill workers at these big box stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2764.044s">I</a> think the big rush is going to be Black Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2765.946s">I</a> have a number of people that I know who I'm friends with who, all Thanksgiving long, can't wait to pack up their bags and get rolling at midnight to go out there and go shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2773.672s">Everybody's</a> chomping at the bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2774.854s">It's</a> historically a day where most of the problems happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2778.257s">That's</a> why I said Black Friday would be something that would be amenable to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2783.281s">On</a> the motion, the clerk will call the roll.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2817.568s">Point</a> of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2818.389s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2819.529s">Um,</a> because we have this 90 day review, if anything does happen during that period of time, we can call Coles and have them back in there and we can discuss any other public safety concerns that we have after this initial issuance of a license and an immediate special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=2831.917s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3173.401s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President, and through you to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3177.023s">Can</a> you tell me who's going to be doing the work? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3178.304s">Is</a> it an internal job? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3179.545s">Do</a> you have a contractor that's going to be performing the thing?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3197.956s">The</a> contractor been selected at this point in time?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3209.51s">The</a> reason I ask, Mr. President, is because I have some concern over the work the contractors have done in the past relative to repairing our roadways to the previously pristine conditions that they are in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3218.156s">But</a> I know that we have some contingencies and controls available here at the city level relative to the applicable permits in the City of Metro regulations and standards for restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3228.264s">So</a> I'll rest.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3542.225s">Yes,</a> Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3543.166s">In</a> thinking a little bit more about the location, Emerson Street is a one-way, if I do recall appropriately, one way up to Maine, up to the gate, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3554.867s">So</a> I guess I have some curiosity as to how exactly traffic would be routed around this project for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3560.269s">And</a> with that being said, I'd also have concern relative to the traffic that would be coming in and out of Tedeschi's and crossing over out of the gate and out to Emerson onto Main. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3572.175s">And</a> where would that traffic go? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3573.175s">Because</a> I think the way that Tedeschi's is set up right now, the parking spots are all slanted so that the cars are directed to go down to the back of the parking lot, exit onto Emerson, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3584.405s">and</a> back out onto Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3585.987s">So</a> those are some concerns that I think we have here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3588.909s">However,</a> the Mass Eye and Ear Institute is one of the premier research hospitals in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3594.915s">And</a> I think it's a privilege and an honor to have them here located in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3598.358s">I</a> also think that without the technology that they need in order to operate, we're going to be doing them a disservice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3604.124s">So</a> I, too, will be supporting this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3609.438s">However,</a> I do have some questions and concerns relative to the actual traffic flow and traffic mitigation that's going to be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3617.325s">And</a> I was wondering if the gentleman could speak to that a little bit, if possible.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3685.974s">You've</a> got the police officers that are going to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3688.936s">They're</a> going to be performing detail work on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3690.897s">I'm</a> sure that it'll be in compliance with the traffic plan, which is in compliance with the established rules and regulations that we have in place.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3698.54s">I</a> don't need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3699.38s">I'm</a> satisfied based upon the plan.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=3702.102s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4015.148s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4015.808s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4016.729s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4018.25s">Yes,</a> Mr. President, through to the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4020.212s">Is</a> the work done in-house or is there a contractor that's going to be doing the work?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4035.959s">And</a> a contract that hasn't been selected as of yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4038.181s">Not</a> yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4039.341s">There'll</a> be a project manager on hand in case there are any complaints? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4042.484s">If</a> there are any complaints, they can reach out to me and I'll be certain that they'll be taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4046.607s">Terrific.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4047.267s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4047.807s">I'm</a> satisfied, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4048.888s">I</a> yield.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4559.005s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4560.846s">And</a> thank you, Councilor Penta, for bringing this issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4564.023s">I</a> certainly agree with some of your points. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4565.364s">However,</a> I urge my colleagues to move with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4568.265s">Recently,</a> I believe this fiscal year, GASB, which is the Government Accounting Standards Bureau, has come out with a number of papers which will change the way that we're allowed to forecast and we're allowed to report our liabilities on our balance sheets, which means that if we're reporting liabilities that are less than what we have, our balance sheets are going to be off and we're actually going to go and owe more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4589.76s">So</a> if we owe more money on our liabilities that aren't showing up on our balance sheets now but will be later on, and we're spending money of our free cash to offset this, we might have a perilous effect on our bond rating, Mr. President, because we're going to be taking money out of our reserves to pay for this unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4604.709s">With</a> these new reforms that are coming in place and these new reporting requirements, I think that we need to move with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4609.692s">I</a> think we need to get a report back from the Retirement Board as to what steps they've taken to address the generally accepted accounting principles that have been adopted by the federal government and passed down to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4619.575s">I</a> think that it's important to understand that the unfunded liability is really a mismatch between the estimated returns that we have on our long-term investments and the estimated assets that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4628.065s">So</a> in looking at what's happened, the GASB group has <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4634.897s">really</a> taking a look at the way that we forecast. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4637.358s">And</a> municipalities usually forecast at a rate upwards of 8 percent, while private sector pension plans usually forecast at around a rate of 4 percent, which is a little bit more in line with what the actual returns on investments are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4649.786s">Now,</a> as I've done further research, I've seen that the 25 largest pension systems for municipalities are returning at about 7.5 percent or 7.25 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4658.911s">So</a> there's certainly some concern here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4661.418s">I</a> think that we need to be on strong financial footing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4663.319s">We</a> need to make sure that we keep money in the bank, and we need to be sure that we don't have a perilous effect on our bond rating before we move forward and start, you know, issuing annual checks for $500,000 a year to offset this pension liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4675.865s">It</a> might not be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4676.685s">It</a> might be too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4677.846s">There</a> might not be a break-even there, and our bond rate is going to start to drop, and our pension liability is going to go up because of the new reporting requirements, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4684.909s">So</a> I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=4687.511s">For</a> those reasons and the uncertainty, I'm going to be voting against this resolution.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5198.13s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5199.471s">That's</a> what I was getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5200.351s">You</a> know, with GASB making these changes to the actual accounting and reporting principles that are in place and the federal government adopting them as generally accepted accounting principles, the city of Medford is going to have to take a look at the way that we are doing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5213.74s">I'm</a> not saying that this is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5215.181s">I</a> didn't say that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5217.153s">What</a> I'm saying is I think we need to tread lightly and we need to use caution because we don't want to make a decision that's going to have a long-term dramatic effect on our financial viability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5224.836s">Now,</a> I understand what Councilor Penta is coming from, saying, well, we're never going to have financial viability if we have this unfunded debt and this unfunded liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5231.719s">However,</a> if we're looking at how we're going to pay it off and we have the free cash sitting in the bank collecting 1%, <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5237.207s">And</a> we can take that money out and bond it for 2 or 3 or 4 percent because we have a AAA bond rating and then use that to spend down a pension liability that's going to get us a return to 15 percent, like he says. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5246.135s">I</a> don't see how we're losing money. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5247.636s">But</a> that's a question for another day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5249.638s">I'll</a> certainly support the paper to go to committee to ask these questions that we have to get better informed and to properly vet the issue before we make a demand or make a — ask the question for the mayor to expend $500,000 annually to fully fund the pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5262.869s">I</a> know that we've gotten a report back from Ann Baker. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5264.71s">I</a> believe it was in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5265.968s">relative</a> to the plan that they currently have in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5268.049s">However,</a> I don't have any understanding or any commitment or any knowledge that the city's actually looking at these new accounting principles and these new accounting standards that have been put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5277.271s">That's</a> why I asked my colleagues to tread lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5279.491s">That's</a> why I think this issue needs to be vetted a little bit further before we can ask this question and make this recommendation, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5306.739s">You're</a> saying we're getting returns of 15%, 20%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5310.041s">Other</a> communities are getting returns of 15% or 20%, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5311.823s">Those</a> are, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5313.224s">So</a> if we bond the money for 3% and we invest that money and we're getting returns of 15%, I don't see how we're losing.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5354.654s">But</a> what I'm saying is, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5355.955s">Why</a> aren't we putting up $6 or $7 million if that's going to address the problem and address the need and address it now, in the real time, right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5361.538s">Why</a> aren't we doing that?
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5396.218s">Point</a> of information, counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5397.319s">If</a> the federal government has changed their standards and they're making the municipalities and the states report their unfunded liabilities differently than they have required them to do in the past, then this information and data that we're getting isn't going to be accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5410.708s">If</a> they're not reporting the liabilities the way that GASB and the way that the generally accepted accounting principles are calling for, then they can give us all the data in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5419.033s">But</a> if they're not giving us a forecasted <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=5422.198s">You</a> know, if they're not giving us a forecasted, estimated liability that's done properly, it's garbage in, garbage out.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7313.085s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7315.005s">I</a> believe the paper that was before us was for the gentleman to address the council on whether or not we should purchase an arts and media center. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7322.268s">That</a> is the paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7323.949s">Thank</a> you for your point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7389.485s">Communication</a> from the mayor.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7462.383s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7649.533s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7651.486s">I</a> felt it was appropriate that we bring this resolution forward this week, whereas we're not going to be meeting the week of Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7657.328s">As</a> we all know, the country has been embroiled in turmoil for a number of years overseas in the Middle East. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7663.611s">And</a> we've had many men and women return to Medford and return to Massachusetts, suffering from the effects of being overseas at war. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7673.035s">I</a> think that we've seen a number of people come back from being overseas that are suffering from traumatic brain injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7679.479s">I</a> just think that it's nice that we raise awareness and that we thank the men and women who've actually dedicated their lives and dedicated their time and dedicated their souls to protecting our freedoms, our democracy, and our country.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7960.379s">How</a> did you find the records, Councilor Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7962.26s">Mr.</a> President, I reviewed the records and I found them in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7964.822s">I</a> took special consideration to look at the South Medford neighborhood walk to be sure that everything there was in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/gTjmRR2WUVY&t=7970.705s">There</a> were 13 amendments and they certainly all look like they were right to me, Mr. President, so I'd move for approval.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_A8ucl-IFfU8/2025-03-21_A8ucl-IFfU8.html">Medford City Council - October 21, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=644.946s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=646.747s">Stein,</a> thank you very much for coming down and welcome to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=649.929s">We're</a> glad to see that you're willing to be an active participant in the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=654.912s">I</a> think this is a worthwhile endeavor, Mr. President, and I think that it might make sense for this council to send the paper to the Traffic and Parking Commission for them to maybe conduct an investigation and report back to this council what their findings are and what steps they feel is appropriate for us to take as a community to ensure that we actually address the issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1914.773s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1916.414s">And</a> I've had some conversations with Matthew about this very same endeavor that he's looking to spearhead, and I think it's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1924.751s">I,</a> too, have some concern about the $20 fee to be charged to get a copy of the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1928.674s">And</a> I think that it might make sense for our rules committee to take a look at the fee structure that we use for providing an archived copy of the tape to a member of the general public who wishes to have a copy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1939.902s">So</a> I'd like to add that to the paper as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=1941.984s">We</a> refer the issue of the cost of a copy of the tape to our rules committee for investigation and to maybe establish a fee structure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3009.469s">I</a> believe the letter that Councilor Penta refers to was sent to the administration prior to the recommendations being made that the Councilor referred to at the beginning of his soliloquy.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3139.506s">I</a> do believe, if I recall correctly, that the only matter that was before the council that evening is whether or not the council was going to authorize the mayor to enter into a contract that would be 10 years in length. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3149.093s">The</a> actual contracted entity <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3152.355s">was</a> not up for discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3153.496s">That</a> was not within our purview that evening.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=3986.407s">Mr.</a> President, as I understand it, the motion before us right now is from Councilor Dello Russo, which would be to request that info sessions be held, as I understand it correctly, Councilor, and as well as a cost comparison be conducted regarding 15 minutes free and 50 cents for the first hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4004.751s">Is</a> that correct, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4006.25s">compared</a> to the dollar, no free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4011.334s">Mr.</a> President, I don't have a problem with either one of these amendments to the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4016.538s">I</a> think that if in fact we were going to request the traffic and the parking commission to hold an info session relative to the parking enforcement program, that they would do such and hold meetings in each business district to make it easy for the business operators to come there, to have less of an impact on their day-to-day operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4033.597s">and</a> to allow everybody an opportunity to understand what's actually going to be unveiled.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4423.676s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4428.07s">In</a> looking at the issue, there's a number of questions that need to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4430.651s">A</a> number of questions should be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4432.451s">And</a> as such, we have a subcommittee structure that's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4434.652s">And</a> I think that's the appropriate area and appropriate arena for us to get these questions answered, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4439.553s">So,</a> you know, I wholeheartedly support Councilor Caraviello's idea to keep this in either the Committee of the Whole or the Committee on Transportation to get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4448.192s">Once</a> we get the questions answered, then we'll be more informed, and then we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4451.593s">But</a> the underlying paper that's before us is the council's official position on paid APOC. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4456.613s">Now</a> we have a series of amendments that have been added to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4458.674s">We've</a> asked a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4460.194s">I</a> really think the appropriate place to ask these questions would be in committee, so that we all have the answers, and then we can all make an informed decision as to what direction we as a council want to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4469.916s">Then</a> why is the paper on the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4470.916s">Well,</a> if there's no direction for us to move, then why are we <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4481.288s">I</a> don't think anybody in this table is precluding them from doing that counsel.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4640.035s">Point</a> of clarification, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4641.735s">Point</a> of order, rather. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4642.416s">I</a> think it might make more sense, instead of us throwing questions at the City Clerk to have him jot down, that we set a Committee of the Whole meeting, we set a deadline for us to actually email the questions that we want answered to the City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4654.019s">The</a> City Clerk can put them together in a packet for us, if he's so willing, and we can send that packet to the Mayor's office, we can get the answers that we want answered, we can call the people in front of us to clarify these questions at the Committee of the Whole meeting, and then we can move forward as a body.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6401.704s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President, and I'd like to thank the <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6405.853s">South</a> Medford residents together for putting this event together, as well as Chief Sacco for being so willing to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6411.216s">I</a> think this is a great way to get things done in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6413.938s">It</a> brings people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6414.938s">It</a> allows people the opportunity to meet their neighbors and meet some people in the city that they may not otherwise have the opportunity to interact with. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6421.923s">I</a> was unable to attend, as you can tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6423.764s">I've</a> been hacking pretty hard over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6425.805s">I</a> was a little ill over the weekend, and I would have liked to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6428.546s">And</a> I do have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6430.107s">And</a> one of the major problems that I see is I drive through South Medford a lot of the time <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6434.995s">vehicles</a> traveling, say, down Main Street towards Alexander's, then we'll have a car double parked in front of Bocelli's, and we'll have a car trying to take a left-hand turn across the double line into slanted parking spots that are slanted the wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6448.961s">And</a> I didn't know if this was something that was raised during the meeting or if this was a topic of concern for the residents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6454.183s">I</a> understand that that's a little bit heavier of a lift than some of the things that are on this list right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6458.845s">I</a> think Councilor Marks did an excellent job in <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6461.683s">and</a> making a concise and precise punch list for us to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6466.606s">And</a> I certainly wholeheartedly support the majority of the recommendations that have been made here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6471.489s">So</a> with that being said, I was wondering if someone could enlighten me a little bit relative to the parking issue and the vehicles that take the turn across Main Street into the slanted parking spots that don't really seem conducive to that type of turn across the double yellow line.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7308.599s">Thank</a> you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7309.74s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=7309.921s">Briley</a> did come up and speak a little bit about the issues that she's had down at the end of Bonner and Mystic Avenue in the past, and it seems to me that some of these issues still persist, so if we could include that as part of the B paper that's going to go to the Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs, I'd be appreciative.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8112.828s">As</a> I understand it, the money that would be transferred from these retained earnings would be used to fund a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8119.914s">And</a> the money that they're taking out of these retained earnings to fund this contract is an appropriate use, because it's going to be used to provide the salaries for people that work in the delivery of our water and our sewer system.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8140.774s">I'm</a> not so sure.

 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8528.589s">Point</a> of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8531.01s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8531.211s">Andre,</a> I do also believe that the Water Commission does meet monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8535.2s">I</a> don't have that information in front of me right now as to when the Water Commission will meet again, but I know it's posted on the city's website.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8545.288s">It's</a> in the afternoon now. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8546.369s">I</a> think it's in the afternoon now.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8554.369s">I</a> don't work in the afternoon only. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=8555.731s">I'm</a> in the same shipyard, believe me.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9089.329s">I</a> just did some figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9090.13s">It</a> looks like you're using like close to 6,000 gallons of water a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9094.991s">And</a> I'm sorry, yeah, 6,000 cubic feet of water a year.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9100.193s">And</a> each cubic foot's the equivalent to eight gallons. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=9102.394s">I</a> go out to the laundry.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_SzZSQAzqgnA/2025-03-21_SzZSQAzqgnA.html">Medford City Council - October 14, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=79.171s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=81.534s">It's</a> with great pleasure that I bring this resolution forward this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=84.077s">Anthony</a> Petrellis is someone who I consider a friend, and when I learned of this momentous achievement being bestowed upon him, I was very pleased, elated to say the least, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=95.086s">Today,</a> Mr. Petrellis is in the audience, and he's also accompanied by a number of his colleagues that know what a great job he does, and I think had something to do with nominating him for this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=104.603s">With</a> that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to give Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=106.787s">Carino</a> an opportunity to come up here and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=108.61s">She's</a> the principal at the McGlynn Middle School, to talk about Anthony's character and why this award is so fitting.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=250.04s">Anthony,</a> congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=251.741s">On</a> behalf of the Medford City Council, Anthony, it's my privilege to present you with this citation, which reads, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Anthony Petrellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=261.509s">Whereas</a> Anthony Petrellis has been named the 2014 Millikan Educator Award recipient, and whereas the Millikan Educator Award is a national accolade awarded to only 40 educators nationwide annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=273.747s">And</a> whereas Anthony Petrellis is the sole educator from the state of Massachusetts to be bestowed this great honor, and where Anthony has shown an untiring commitment to the educational excellence on behalf of the city of Medford and the Medford public schools, it is with great pleasure we extend this heartfelt thank you.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1305.691s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1307.712s">I'd</a> like to offer the floor to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1310.493s">Kathy</a> Young here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1311.253s">Kathy</a> is a volunteer with our Office of the Environment and Energy, and she'd like to make a brief announcement about this weekend's festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1321.297s">Name</a> and address of the record, please.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1654.466s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1656.728s">In</a> recent weeks, I've gotten a number of calls relative to what I guess would be labeled trash truck slime leaking out of the trash trucks, causing a little bit of a problem relative to quality of life in certain neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1669.039s">I've</a> gotten a number of calls from the Lawrence Street neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1673.183s">It's</a> also happened right in my own backyard, Mr. President, along Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1676.8s">We've</a> seen it on Spring Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1678.22s">So</a> I'd ask that Waste Management do an inspection of their vehicles to ensure that they're not leaking any trash and refuse and fluid onto our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1685.882s">I</a> think it may pose a significant public health hazard, but more or less it's really just a quality of life issue.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1842.445s">Mr.</a> President, if this matter is moved for approval and we're all in favor of it, I was going to ask for a reconsideration on the previous vote because no vote was taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1852.918s">Let's</a> do this one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1857.4s">Councilor</a> Penta.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2239.207s">Yes,</a> motion for reconsideration on paper 14699. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2240.628s">Mr.</a> President, the vote wasn't taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2242.909s">I'd</a> ask that it be taken in the call of the ayes and nays.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2252.313s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2256.035s">Motion</a> for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2256.975s">Motion</a> for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2258.156s">Call</a> of the ayes and nays.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2435.935s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2438.316s">I</a> don't see any reason why we'd hold this one business to a higher standard than what's required under state statute, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2444.539s">I</a> think that this is something that's a reasonable request that falls in line with what the law is and I might certainly be supporting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2449.481s">I</a> think we should move for approval, but I'd like Councilor Marksley to obviously have a chance to talk on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2454.183s">However,</a> I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2455.302s">see</a> any reason why we'd need to hold them to a higher standard or a different standard than that of any other business here in the community.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3252.477s">Mr.</a> President, we're dealing with two separate issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3254.819s">We're</a> dealing with the matter that's before us, which it appears that, you know, Coles does have the right to just mail these out pre-postage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3262.907s">Anything</a> else that we want to do that might well fall under the suggestion that Councilor Dello Russo had going forward.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3276.198s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3276.378s">So</a> going forward, maybe we should consider Councilor De La Ruta's suggestion that we can go and we can refer that matter to the Rules Committee and come up with something that we can all live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3284.341s">But</a> as of right now, in this point in time, there is no requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3287.282s">So</a> I think that what we should do, Mr. President, would be move for approval on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3290.924s">And</a> then if, in fact, we need to come up with a process or a policy that the Rules Committee can do such and report it back to the Committee of the Whole for further deliberation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3311.683s">Right,</a> until we change the procedure.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3314.605s">There</a> is no procedure to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3316.627s">Right</a> now there is one.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3329.978s">And</a> if there are some internal controls that the council feels that those should be made, photocopying of the envelope, so on and so forth, that's all well and good.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4140.012s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4141.112s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4143.407s">I</a> agree with Mr. Givern wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4145.188s">I</a> think that the Bicycle Commission meets rather frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4147.669s">They</a> have a large board of people that are probably much more avid cyclists than anybody behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4154.971s">They</a> know the dangers that they face. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4156.692s">They</a> know what the city needs to do to make them safer, because they're out there every day on these roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4161.874s">So</a> I think it would make sense if we got an advisory opinion from the Bicycle Commission to see what direction that they'd like to see us go. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4170.68s">a</a> number of issues aside from public safety and how to make Medford more bicycle-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4175.023s">And</a> I think that maybe if we look at this in a more comprehensive fashion, if we're going to send something to the legislature, that would be worth its weight.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4186.69s">I'd</a> like to table the matter and have it be sent to the Bicycle Commission for recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4191.213s">Then</a> we can bring it back to the floor for discussion.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5159.497s">I</a> believe when we were at the meeting in executive session with the mayor and we granted him the authority to enter into this contract for a term of 10 years, that we did not put any criteria upon the mayor's ability to negotiate this contract in terms of having a councillor present as a member of his negotiating team. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5174.098s">I</a> think it's very important to keep in mind that we want the mayor to go into this and negotiate a contract in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5179.163s">And</a> the mayor can't go and negotiate a contract in good faith if he can't bring that back to the board and have confidence that it's going to be passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5185.149s">You</a> know, we gave him the opportunity to go out there and we gave him an opportunity to enter into a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5189.153s">As</a> Councilor Lungo-Koehn has said a number of times, and her sentiment is something that I have echoed, we knew what we were getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5194.899s">We</a> saw the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5196.255s">Councilman</a> Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5197.216s">This</a> is the mayor's parking plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5198.577s">The</a> mayor put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5199.557s">The</a> mayor negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5200.458s">The</a> criteria come right out of the corner office. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5202.599s">They</a> don't come from this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5204.08s">The</a> authority that we gave him was to enter into the agreement solely. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5208.163s">But</a> when we were in the executive session, we saw what the plan was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5211.505s">We</a> saw what the plan was. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5212.486s">We</a> knew what it was going to entail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5214.067s">We</a> weren't allowed to talk about it.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5240.363s">Mr.</a> President, I'd be interested to see the tape of executive session.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5332.501s">I</a> believe that because the city retains the right to determine where these kiosks, meters, and free spots are going to go, that the recommendation would go to the Traffic and Off-Street Parking Commission and then they would be the ones who would be implementing this because they retain jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5344.386s">We're</a> not giving up any of the sidewalks or any of our streets.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5434.3s">Mr.</a> President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5436.721s">If</a> anybody's been paying attention to the recent debates relative to the Attorney General's race, a hot topic that's been coming up over and over again is sexual assaults on college campuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5446.327s">And</a> that prompted me to do a little bit of investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5449.128s">And</a> I've come across a number of articles, two of which I provided my council colleagues with, as well as one for the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5456.671s">But</a> in the Business Insider, I did take a look at a study. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5462.854s">And</a> the study was authored by Peter Jacobs, June 4, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5467.635s">It</a> was published in Business Insider. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5469.156s">Here</a> are the staggering numbers behind college sexual assault crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5473.328s">More</a> than 99% of sexual assault perpetrators are male. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5476.949s">Females</a> account for around 95% of the sexual assault victims. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5481.41s">Nearly</a> 80% of the perpetrators are the same race of their victim, and around 90% of the victims know their perpetrator. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5488.431s">Freshmen</a> and sophomores in colleges are the most likely to be a victim of sexual assaults. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5493.892s">50%</a> of the sexual assaults happen on Friday or Saturday, the majority of which happen between midnight and 6 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5500.396s">including</a> almost 90% of the assaults when a victim is incapacitated. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5504.777s">More</a> than 40% of college sexual assaults happen in either September or October when there's an influx of new students. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5510.839s">Around</a> 80% of college sexual assaults happen either in the victim's or perpetrator's living quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5516.72s">In</a> a 10-year study of college sexual assault in Massachusetts found that 81% of campus rapes and sexual assaults occurred in an on-campus dormitory. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5524.602s">So</a> these numbers were staggering, Mr. President, and when I read them, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5529.036s">made</a> me want to Google Tufts University and sexual assault on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5532.679s">And</a> what happened was a very troubling article that I came across saying that the US Department of Education and Tufts University are at odds on the way that they're handling sexual assaults. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5542.146s">Marcella</a> Bombardieri, Globe staff from the Boston Globe, published an article on April 29, 2014 that spoke about some of the issues that Tufts University was having with the Department of Education relative to federal funding because of the way they handled the reported on-campus sexual assault. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5557.768s">So</a> with that being said, Mr. President, I think we've all sat up here and said time and time again that our most important job in this community is to keep our residents safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5566.01s">I'd</a> like to see the updated policy regarding the reporting of on-campus sexual assaults from Tufts University for the opportunity to review it, but also to send it to our chief of police and send it to the Middlesex County District Attorney for their review and recommendation.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5841.647s">Councilor</a> Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5842.788s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5845.01s">On</a> Friday evening, I was getting some takeout at Bocelli's, and as I was sitting at the bar waiting for my food, the gentleman beside me <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5853.435s">took</a> an electronic cigarette out of his mouth and started smoking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5855.936s">And</a> it didn't mean much to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5858.096s">And</a> I just kind of looked at him and said, oh, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5860.797s">But</a> the couple sitting next to me that was enjoying their dinner wasn't as pleased as I was to see this happen, Mr. President, which got me thinking, you know, what exactly is going on with the regulation of electronic cigarettes here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5874.821s">And</a> I think with that being said, Mr. President, I did a little bit of research and I found some policy options, copies of which I forwarded to all my colleagues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5883.25s">possibly</a> to regulate the sale, regulate the marketing, or regulate the use of such electronic cigarettes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5888.555s">I</a> guess the end all be all resolution would be to ban electronic cigarettes in all places where smoking is prohibited. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5893.859s">That's</a> the ideal language from the National Center of Tobacco Control. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5897.843s">However,</a> I don't know if that language would actually be something that would work here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5902.427s">So</a> I thought it would be a worthy endeavor for the subcommittee on zoning and <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=5907.002s">ordinances</a> to examine it, to find out what our legal rights are and to find out whether or not it's worthwhile for us to come up with a resolution that would do such.<h2><a href="../2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4/2024-10-16_QTGph9EVRy4.html">Medford, MA City Council - Oct. 7, 2014 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=646.029s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=647.389s">Thank</a> you, Councilor Knox, for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=650.154s">I</a> think this is a great proactive approach to improving the quality of life for residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=655.677s">I</a> will be voting in favor of this resolution and I might ask that the resolution be amended by way of a B paper, Mr. President, which would ask that the Medford police or the building department report back to this council locations that have been reported to have been graffitied within the last 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=670.025s">I</a> think it's very important that we keep track of this data to determine whether or not there were clusters and trends that are occurring here in the city so that we know where to ramp up enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=677.233s">So</a> I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for taking such a proactive approach to looking at the quality of life in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=682.416s">And</a> I will be voting in favor of this resolution, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=684.878s">I</a> just ask that it be amended for the Police Department of the powers that be to report back any locations that have been reported within the last calendar year.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4365.073s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4366.86s">I</a> think it's very important that we recognize the efforts and the leadership that Councilman Marks has put forward on the issue of a dog park. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4373.064s">Not</a> only has he brought this issue to the council floor, he's actually put his money where his mouth is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4376.886s">He's</a> gone out, I witnessed him personally collecting signatures from members in this community to seek support for a dog park, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4384.75s">And</a> that's the proactive grassroots type of work that makes the community really come together and it makes matters like this come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4393.625s">I'd</a> like to congratulate Councilor Marks on the efforts that he's put forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=4396.886s">Not</a> only does he file the resolutions, but he does the legwork.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5602.964s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5608.789s">taken</a> a big interest in recent weeks to the water and sewer billing system and the rates that are in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5613.89s">And</a> in my research, I've been able to determine that in 2006, of the MWRA communities, Medford was the 15th highest consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5624.413s">And</a> it's also my understanding that a tiered rate system is put in place to promote conservation of use of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5631.815s">Previous</a> councils, dating back as far as I've looked to 2007, have consistently voted to establish a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5638.312s">We</a> have paper 07464 to establish a tiered rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5642.034s">Paper</a> 07559 to establish a progressive H2O consumption system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5648.296s">Paper</a> 08591, the city engineer present the tiered system for the council to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5653.418s">09535,</a> a report on the tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5655.779s">09706,</a> creation of a tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5657.18s">09838,</a> an excessive use of water program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5658.82s">10036,</a> the status of a tiered rate system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5669.347s">720,</a> report back on the progress of creating a tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5673.769s">Dating</a> back to 12-4-07, the Medford City Council has been on record in supporting looking at water and sewer rates and eyeing a multi-tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5682.772s">As</a> recently as 12-24, Mr. President, there was an article in the Medford transcript saying that the City Council supported the implementation of a tiered system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5689.495s">Councilor</a> Mayorka was a champion for such a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5692.016s">Councilor</a> Mayorka was of the theory that if you use more, you pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5695.397s">And</a> I certainly agree with that philosophy, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5699.13s">In</a> looking at how the rates are determined, we have a Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5703.072s">The</a> Water and Sewer Commission meets monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5704.994s">Here</a> in my city council packet this week, I received a notice of when this Water and Sewer Commission is going to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5710.597s">For</a> the edification of the people at home, I'd like to let them know that on October 15, 2014, in room 201, at 2 o'clock, the Water and Sewer Commission will be meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5718.982s">It's</a> open to the public and all members can attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5721.204s">Mr.</a> President, I certainly share some concerns about the itemization of the bill, and I too have seen irregularities in water bills, my own included. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5727.504s">Mr.</a> President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5728.084s">However,</a> I think to say that this is a surprise is a little bit of a misconstrue of what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5735.528s">It's</a> not in line with what the history shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5737.448s">It's</a> not in line with what the history says.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5819.174s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5820.535s">And</a> I was getting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5821.776s">I</a> think that, you know, when we get a response from the mayor saying to call a public hearings within the council purview, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5827.522s">We</a> have subcommittees, we have committees, committees of the whole, which has the power to call a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5833.168s">We</a> have a committee on <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5834.744s">auditing</a> finance, budget, and taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5836.444s">We</a> have a subcommittee on intergovernmental affairs, and I think that when we call for a public hearing, we don't need to have the permission of the mayor to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5842.546s">We</a> can use our internal governmental structure that we have here as a council in order to promote these meetings, in order to make these meetings happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5848.968s">So</a> when I looked at it and I saw that it falls within the council purview, and then I read the language in the resolution, I said, well, I think that this refers to the fact that the council does have the power to call this meeting, and we don't need the mayor to give us authority to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5859.67s">And</a> that's where I'm coming from, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5861.131s">I</a> certainly feel as though we need to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5863.427s">better</a> line of communication in terms of the way that our water and sewer billing is implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5868.888s">And</a> I certainly have concerns, because when we look at 2007, we look at the ideas that came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5873.569s">And</a> the tiered system was really 0 to 1,000 cubic feet of use. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5877.87s">And</a> it's gone down to 800. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5879.391s">So</a> I can understand that there must have been some deliberation and some decision-making process. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5883.012s">And</a> I, too, share the concerns as to how do we get to this figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5885.932s">It's</a> my understanding that, based upon conversations that I've had with members of the Water Sewer Commission, that about two-thirds of the households in the city will fall in the first tier. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5894.149s">I</a> haven't seen any hard facts and hard figures on that, but that's what's been represented to me through the conversations that I've had with the Water and Sewer Commission, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5900.893s">So</a> with that being said, I certainly do not see any reason for us to go to the mayor's office and ask the mayor for permission to hold a hearing on this when we have a perfect structure that's in place that's underutilized right now in order to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5911.159s">So</a> I would move, Mr. President, this be forwarded to one of the appropriate subcommittees that we have here that's in existence already for us to actually take ownership of the issue and get the answers that we need without relying on somebody else giving them to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=5921.084s">We</a> can go and extract them.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.158s">Councilor</a> Mack. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6413.598s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6415.079s">I</a> echo the sentiments relative to infrastructure that Councilor Marks has raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6420.515s">Our</a> MWRA assessment is calculated every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6422.897s">It's</a> done so by the MWRA estimating the total amount of revenue that's going to be necessary for them to run their water system. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6429.603s">The</a> chart is then calculated at a flat rate times the metered water used in a community, and that's how they come up with their assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6435.368s">However,</a> it's interesting to point out that debt service represents 60% of the FY15 budget at the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6439.992s">So</a> that means 60% <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6443.826s">of</a> their budget is dedicated just to debt service for infrastructure improvements that they've made to deliver these water to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6449.128s">So</a> I think it's time that we need to take a look internally and say, OK, now it's time for us to make this commitment to our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6454.589s">Because</a> ultimately, in the long run, it is going to reduce the cost for the individuals in this community to pay water bills.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6841.74s">Mr.</a> President, I do appreciate where Councilor Pentland is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6844.501s">However,</a> where we're asking so many questions and we have so many questions, I think it would be better vetted appropriately in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6850.604s">I</a> think that we can ask these questions, we can get answers to these questions, then we can convene as a body as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6855.612s">and</a> we can make recommendations to the Water and Sewer Commission, instead of asking these questions to the Water and Sewer Commission and not having any opportunity to properly vet it. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6863.198s">That's</a> why, Mr. President, I will not be withdrawing my motion to amend.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6935.762s">Yes,</a> please, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=6942.958s">I'd</a> also like to see the city solicitor present where there are some questions relative to legalities.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7078.067s">Um,</a> actually, Mr. President, I think that might make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7080.728s">If</a> any of us have any questions that we'd like to have answered, that we send those questions to the chairperson of the subcommittee to forward to the water and sewer commission prior to this meeting taking place so that we can get this information to us beforehand and have a productive meeting as Councilor Penter suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7094.15s">Valid</a> point.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7290.914s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7292.375s">And</a> Councilor Caraviello brought this up to my attention, actually, would be also Badger Road in Winthrop, where the Caliaco Construction Company's performing infrastructure improvements to our water and sewer pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7302.618s">They're</a> driving over the sidewalk to use that piece of land as a layover land. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7305.939s">And</a> as such, they've caused extensive damage to the curb and siding over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7310.379s">And</a> I believe that's one of the safe routes to schools, Mr. President, so I think that's something that might also need to be looked at.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7347.273s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7348.814s">Where</a> October is National Disability Awareness Month, I found this resolution to be fitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7354.131s">We</a> have a number of projects going on, a number of projects that have been completed, whether it's through community development block grant funds or otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7361.572s">We're</a> seeing park improvements and accessibility, sidewalk improvements for accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7365.353s">And</a> I'd like the director of disability to have an opportunity to come down here and explain to us exactly what progress they've made over the last year or so in terms of improving accessibility and equal opportunity for the residents here in the city.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7395.348s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7396.868s">There</a> are two very proud grandparents in two separate parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7400.476s">Many</a> of us know Joan Gatto from the magnificent Muffin and Bagel Shop, and right now I'm sure she's smiling with the birth of her newest grandson. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7407.801s">As</a> goes Jean Entapa from over in the hillside area of Medford, an employee at Tufts University, who brings, I believe, her third male grandson into the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7417.828s">I</a> think she has about six total. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7419.749s">However,</a> Benjamin David Entapa joins his sister Ava and his sister Callie. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=7425.513s">So</a> we'd like to welcome her to the world and congratulate two proud grandparents, Mr. President.
 <p>[Adam Knight]: <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8147.535s">I</a> think that it's important to point out that all the officers in our department are appropriately trained and the Chief of Police has implemented a number of programs as required by state law and otherwise to ensure the safety of our officers and to ensure the fact that the general public is protected and that, you know, these personnel issues that occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8169.196s">in</a> any organization, within any organization, not just within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8173.658s">So</a> although I appreciate what you're saying, I think that, you know, we're getting a little off base here in terms of, maybe you're losing me here, I'm just trying to figure out what direction you're trying to go in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8182.303s">Maybe</a> if you could, you know, you're talking about staffing levels, you're talking about programming, I'm a little confused as to where you're going here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QTGph9EVRy4&t=8187.645s">All</a> of the above.
