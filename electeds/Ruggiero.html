    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2287.152s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's a combination of Jingle Bells and Mozart.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4293.296s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4297.5s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=4298.821s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5211.694s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for the great honor to serve the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5216.117s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have to thank both my kids and my wife, who often sometimes, you know, they have to sacrifice a little bit of their daddy so I can give up time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5225.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's been a great honor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5227.004s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much, Mayor Burke and Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5229.586s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4615.887s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for this report, and it's great that we're seeing the cash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4620.132s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just curious, are we going to also be using this funding to improve the intercom system, or is that going to be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4634.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so would teachers that are in the rooms that don't have intercom access, would they be given a radio, or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5634.7s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5636.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So first, how many open staffing positions do we have currently?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5698.04s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it's not just 70 divided by 13?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5699.142s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5743.875s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if someone comes, they get a job?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5745.696s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that how it'sâ€”if they pass all the Cori checks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5795.752s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in terms of volunteers, because I noticed on the back page it talked about middle school volunteers and such.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5800.939s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Have you talked to any people in the senior center or any seniors to come down or perhaps we could do a tax deferment program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5831.288s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So are parents, are parents asked to be volunteers as well?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5840.748s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I mean, I would imagine, so let's say, for example, you are one of these parents that's on a waiting list right now, and so you have to do the calculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5848.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Someone says, well, you come in one day a week, and that'll cover your waiting list spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5855.142s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That seems like a reasonable request, or we could say the certain ratio of so many days volunteering guarantees a position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5862.989s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5884.474s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I mean, I understand that this idea that co-op might not work, but it'd be interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5888.094s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When was the last time a letter was sent to parents saying that there's a need?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5892.335s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you do happen to have a couple of days that are free, it'd be great if you could help out with the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5898.458s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Has any of the outreach been done to the PTOs or to the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5914.546s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It might surprise you if it perhaps, I mean, make a suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5917.287s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't want to criticize the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5919.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know you do a lot of good work, but perhaps it would be helpful.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5922.129s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to let parents know that if they could put in a little bit more time, especially to the PTOs, if you happen to have one or two evenings a week free, it would be helpful, and then we could start servicing more children, not perhaps with a promise, but just letting people know, you know, if we get more help, we're going to get more help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5938.617s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The second line of questioning I had to do with the paragraph that talked about tuition, are there any children who are, cannot receive,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5949.911s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They can't be a part of the program because they don't have the money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5958.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so, because I guess I'm referring to, unfortunately we know that there's a wait list for vouchers at the state level for parents that qualify, and new state regulations have made the staff requirements reporting process extremely cumbersome.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5973.59s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you speak to that a little bit?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5974.95s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it really does sound like there are parents that are trying to participate in the program, waited a long time to be, and then they just sort of got bumped because they couldn't, the state voucher system changed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=5986.658s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Has that happened?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6027.084s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wonder if I could call... It's possible you could just hand them a mailer and say, could you please send this to people on the list, letting them know that... Because I guess my concern with the program is threefold.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6038.811s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, I want to echo what Member Ruseau said.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6040.913s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, talking to many parents, they just don't bother applying because why climb a mountain that you're not even going to be able to get to the top of?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6047.697s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's that issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6049.639s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And parents that would like to participate in the program, they find themselves just finding other options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6054.962s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not worth the hassle and maybe the issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6059.566s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I'm also worried that there are families that need this support, and we're not getting it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6067.451s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I guess they come in two flavors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6071.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: After school, you have students that are there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6073.916s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that their parents want them to participate and they need a little help.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6076.477s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then there's parents that kind of need their kids to be there for them to work that second job to put bread on the table.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6082.459s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just want to make sure that we're reaching out to those families.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6103.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6103.405s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I understand that there might be information that you're not privy to but I mean I just say look I'll make you a Xerox.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6109.131s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Here's a bunch of pages handed out to your members because I mean it seems like you know my family we also use after school services but we can find options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6118.841s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There are other families that you know single moms that just don't have that option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7030.455s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Suggestion to the amendment to the motion, I would like to have a cost-benefit analysis of what it would have cost to do complete enrollment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7037.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7038.639s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Other districts have done it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7040.219s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's going to cost us more money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7041.82s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7042.841s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to know how much it costs, because I think it's an opportunity for our community to step above and beyond what other communities in our region do, but also recognize that other school districts in America are able to pull this off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7056.147s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we can too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7057.207s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to know, I would like to suggest<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7059.568s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that in addition to understanding where we are now, I would like an actual assessment of what this would cost us to have full enrollment, or if any kid has a need to have an after school program, we can address that need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7074.898s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, it's an amendment or it'll be a separate motion if she doesn't want to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=7081.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1326.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1330.37s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So going through the list of resignations here, I noticed that our nutritionist retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1335.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So who's current, do we have any backup nutritionist, or is Rhetta the only one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1345.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So are we anticipating on hiring someone new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1348.805s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if so, when are we going to post the position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1371.906s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, my concern is that not having a nutritionist on staff for the entire district I think is not a great idea as we're piloting a new program like you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1382.934s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I seriously would like to suggest that we start looking to fill that position as soon as possible or find some sort of solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1390.64s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Secondly, just I suppose a little greedy for me, I mean, who's gonna be taking care of the blueberries in the middle of the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1397.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know what's going on with the outdoor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1407.77s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So right now we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1411.912s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1412.292s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She was just taking it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1413.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know she did a lot of work, including making hummus for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1417.414s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is concerning to me, especially with some other information that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1424.978s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just would like to be updated when we find out more about it and when we're going to be filling out the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.055s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.835s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And thank you very much for all the hard work on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4480.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know this is not just important to me, but our entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4484.778s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do have a couple of questions really quick about the initial observations of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4490.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So September 16th, you said, that we did the initial map testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4494.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4496.224s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So can you give us a sense of, it was the REI score, was that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4502.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it RET?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4503.328s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.009s">[Ruggiero]</a>: R-I-T.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So on that score, is dyslexia viewed as sort of a place on the spectrum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4514.072s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is dyslexia, how is dyslexia exactly tested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4518.034s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because that's sort of an either or type of prognostic measure versus sort of like a value on a bell curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4574.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what we're looking at here is sort of a battery of different skills, and so if a kid sort of, for lack of a better word, bombs a bunch of regions or domains on those skills, then they're forwarded to someone, or how would that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4679.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess my concern with the issue, and I have no doubt on the abilities of the staff to handle these issues, but being able to address dyslexia is a serious concern that people devote an entire medical career to, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4694.135s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have someone who knows how to handle these kids versus sort of a generalist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4698.92s">[Ruggiero]</a>: you know, environment that you would have from the teachers address these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4702.784s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, I mean, there's certainly a difference between reading difficulty and dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4707.669s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I guess that's what I'm trying to suss out here on these metrics you're bringing ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4714.736s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, if you see, like, five red flags,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4717.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you say, OK, so we'll give this kid a couple of months to try to, we'll really focus, we'll bring in some coaches or whatever it takes to get this kid moving, or do we start moving that information ahead with the parents, say, look, this child might need help outside of school in addition to the work that we're doing inside of school, and we've got to figure out a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4739.176s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you understand the question I'm trying to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4823.69s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think it's important that we recognize this as a committee, that we're not screening for dyslexia, we're screening for reading ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4831.395s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so the question I have would be, let's say, for example, you give a student this test and they don't do very well for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4841.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So intervention is applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4843.464s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When is the next test happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4906.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Does that help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4907.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I certainly do not doubt the ability and the hard work of our teachers, but I think the reason why we're having this conversation now is the recognition that some kids slip through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4918.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean that some children who had dyslexia weren't identified in maybe the quickest way possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4926.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or maybe we could do a better job of identifying earlier to make sure that these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4930.631s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm trying to get a hold of is what is the educational roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4936.234s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I understand a kid, let's say a kid doesn't do great in fall, he doesn't do great in winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4942.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's say he doesn't do great in spring either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4944.96s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When do we begin to start huddling up and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4948.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: well, maybe this child is dyslexic and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4951.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's not, it's just a different way of thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4954.323s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's so we need to address something outside of school or some other technique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4959.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5054.61s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, and I completely understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5056.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So my son is sick, for example, let's say he has a cough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5059.614s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We take him to the doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5061.095s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The doctor runs a battery of screens and maybe prescribes him an antibiotic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5066.059s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if he's still sick in a number of other weeks, then we do other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5069.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no doubt what you're all trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5072.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess one of the things that's not clear to me is the course by which it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5077.969s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I understand it's certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5079.83s">[Ruggiero]</a>: somewhat you play it by the kid, so each kid's a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5083.372s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5084.513s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it's important for me to understand that after, let's say, eight or nine months of intervention, we're not going anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5090.476s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's sort of a stopgap or a necessitated next move that we have to make sure, because I mean... So we don't let it go that long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5099.081s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sure you wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5124.555s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess so as I'm talking to different people, there is the perception or belief or parents have this experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5132.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I'm trying to make sure that we don't have the experience where someone had to pay for their own assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5138.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They told the kids just a little has a little trouble with reading or will never be a novelist or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5144.244s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are words the parents will tell me that was was told to their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5147.765s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They paid for an intervention, and now they're actually working with an outside consultant to make sure that that child has the help they need, and they're catching it in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5156.673s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5157.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I'm a teacher myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5159.095s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand when you have a classroom of students, sometimes maybe their dyslexic kids can often be very bright and very good at hiding and shielding their certain inabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5173.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I guess I just want to make sure when I talk to this parent, I can say to them, well, these things won't happen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5179.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have a new screening program and we have a new roadmap to making sure that kids get the process and the help that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5187.082s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5195.47s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5196.091s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5197.232s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5198.954s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5436.72s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think it's important to recognize I'm not other members that would like to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5441.123s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well let me ask a few more questions member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5444.165s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to get a sense of the early assessments that have been taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5447.366s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean can you give us a sense of what percentage of children have been identified with needs or certain deficits and reading skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5472.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so yeah, it would be really great to hear an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5475.278s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for all the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5477.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5478.701s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's great that we're doing the screening now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5481.023s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6140.968s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6143.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to follow up on Paul's point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6146.757s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is data collected about our students unbeknownst to them or is there any personalized information that Lexia will then harvest on our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6156.768s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I assume they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6157.649s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I hope they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6164.376s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6165.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of, I just wanted to get one second because as we were talking about this letter that goes out to all parents, are the different areas of testing necessarily aligned between the maps and Lexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6177.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I imagine like phonemes are in there somewhere and sentence comprehension is in there somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6182.762s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6183.903s">[Ruggiero]</a>: broad areas that could be used when you send this report to parents and saying, we're concerned about sentence comprehension, but we're on it and we're focused on these particular materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6193.471s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could something like that be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6773.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6776.772s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We get the RFP in hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6848.135s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I would much rather have another committee meeting than before approving a $1.3 million contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6854.499s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just voicing my opposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1237.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1238.859s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Two quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1240.041s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to know, so we're all set with all the air compressors and the HVAC, or are we still in process of repairing a number of them all?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1248.573s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1249.554s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what is, this is on page seven, what CDW government<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=1998.405s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really think this is a great program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2001.526s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm really glad that we're doing it in our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2004.587s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There was something I saw about a month ago on a frontline program, and I wanted to mention it to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2008.709s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know if this would help your work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2010.729s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was about community policing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2012.51s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what they were talking about in the program was how many interactions within some communities with the police is always negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2019.732s">[Ruggiero]</a>: the police are coming in to often make what has appeared to be difficulties as they solve problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2026.497s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One of the solutions that this program recommended was for police to offer tickets for good behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2032.181s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if they see children in parks doing something, just like having fun, not loitering, not being destructive, giving tickets for positive behavior and trying to make the interaction with police, especially in communities that have, unfortunately, more interactions with police, more positive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2049.192s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I don't know if that suggestion would help you, but I thought it was a really great idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2053.797s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know, I think it was the police department, either Sacramento or Oakland, California, had used this particular program to great effect, to create more community interaction with police in a positive light, rather than, you know, a cop comes to your house because there's a community disruption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2895.011s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, in terms of the free breakfast program, I've been hearing a couple of issues I just wanted to clarify with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2903.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So are these just like cereals that we're offering or what?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2907.382s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're pretty, they're robust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2975.553s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I know the report is not officially out yet, but could you give us a sense of what the participation rate is, just a ballpark figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3757.808s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3759.55s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3760.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You've done a great job trying to keep this stuff up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3762.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My one concern is- Well, it's not just me, by the way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3770.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Fair enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3772.205s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do have one little concern to sort of branch off what Member Ruseau was talking about.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3776.167s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's see something, say something out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3778.629s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That phrase carries a police connotation to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3781.57s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When I hear that, I think I see something on a subway that looks suspicious, and I'm going to report it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3786.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But my concern is that it's going to go into one giant bucket.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3791.335s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's going to be the broken light, linoleum that's a little warped, with what could be a serious security concern in that same place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3829.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not just because of the way you were describing it a second ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3834.786s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I'm trying to say is I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3847.901s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3848.461s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And a light is a security measure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3850.462s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3850.742s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're going to be able to separate the signal from the noise.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3853.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, obviously a broken light is important, but a suspicious bag is more important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4180.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for your commitment to improving our math curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4186.254s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would just like to suggest, as you're walking through, if we can get an update on how you feel like our ELL instruction in the math environment is doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4194.197s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As I voiced earlier today, it's an area I think is of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4198.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would be very interested to hear about your thoughts in this regard about how we, because I think, you know, the reason why we're suffering in our percentages is this one, a couple of areas, and that's one of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=428.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=429.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Joseph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=430.547s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let me shake your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=454.397s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=455.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=465.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=471.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=473.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=474.346s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=533.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=536.343s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=537.603s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=538.684s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=583.88s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.04s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.761s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=616.864s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=617.824s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=620.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=628.092s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=632.916s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=640.221s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=643.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=644.406s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.187s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2057.984s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2058.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2059.665s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a couple of questions about excused absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2063.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's assume for a moment we had a child with extraordinary abilities, perhaps they were like a chess master at a very young age, and they had a tournament to attend and it conflicted with school hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2074.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would that student be able to receive an excused absence to attend a tournament?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2090.188s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I assume the administration wouldn't penalize a child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2146.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2148.664s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm slightly disappointed by the stance our schools took for a couple of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2154.047s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I certainly understand member Van der Kloot's thought that we need to review the policy and change the policy and perhaps the direction that we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2164.312s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The whole point of this walkout is to draw attention to the fact that adults aren't solving this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2171.756s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the fact of the matter is that by not sort of excusing these absences, we're actually providing almost proof to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2183.042s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Look, it's more important for you to go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2185.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: practice with your color than deal with the fact that the oceans might rise by a couple of feet in a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2192.29s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is, I think, ultimately what disappoints me the most about the school's proposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2198.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, to sort of echo what member Ruseau mentioned, we would not excuse students to attend a hate rally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.306s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.746s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's, that, no, it's not the question, just like a child who is a chess prodigy, we'd all get together and say, you know, this kid's doing well in school, we'll make sure they make up their material, or a child that's going to Spain, perhaps, we'll make sure that they make up their material, they won't miss any schoolwork, and we'll give them excused absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2225.342s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That position could have been taken here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2228.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I guess that's what I find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2231.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There is wiggle, I mean, once again, we don't have the policy at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2235.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But we as a community, as a country and a world, have to recognize that there are things that are more important than words written on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2244.169s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we need to, if we have the capacity to, just like I'm sure in Boston, they don't have a only climate activism is excused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2253.773s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And just sort of one last point in this regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2257.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also think it's a little,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2259.898s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't necessarily know whether teachers should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2263.222s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean part of the idea of this walkout is for students to express their anger and frustration about what we as adults are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2272.313s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know and we all share responsibility in what's happening in our world right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2277.5s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that these are important things to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2279.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of the excused absence, I think we can call it what we like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2286.4s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We should not penalize these students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2287.86s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We should excuse these absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2290.441s">[Ruggiero]</a>: People should not be made to feel like, oh, I have to choose between my world or a bunch of kids I play football with that I really love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2297.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's not a fair choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2648.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I support where member Van der Kloot is going with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2651.928s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to offer a friendly suggestion or two amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2654.97s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to excuse the 1% of students right now that did not attend school on that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2662.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The 1% that you said there was a dip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2665.494s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to excuse all students that did not attend school that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2669.946s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that makes more sense than, if we're going to start actually beginning to take action on what's happening on climate, I think then we have to recognize in talking about policy, about which students need to be excused when, I don't necessarily think that, that addresses the issue to the spirit of what the students are trying to protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2690.616s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would like to stand behind them in any way possible, and this is the way I think we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2799.346s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We don't have the policy in front of us to tweak it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2801.908s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We need language to tweak it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2819.243s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that is the action that we critique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2821.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're talking about 1% of students, if there were some students that were sick that day, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, okay, we'll count them among them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2829.368s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We'll count them among the excused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2830.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think there's going to be some sort of huge consequence to this behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2834.551s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I don't think that we're setting some sort of awful precedent that if people want to go to Charlottesville and hit someone else in the car that we're somehow supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2842.134s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think this, with all due respect to the committee, and with all due respect, I think it sends more of a message to our support of the students, that if we vote now and excuse all the students that weren't able to, that have unexcused absences on the book, now we can do that as a committee, rather than send it to a subcommittee where we talk about it and it comes again in like four weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2890.191s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2996.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I suppose that this is my reservation in all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3002.944s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I deeply understand students, they wanted to go, they were worried that they would get an unexcused absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3008.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And now we're going to retcon it in retroactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3019.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe that's something that will actually, they'll remember that they had a moment when they could have gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3027.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They could have standed out for the climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3031.017s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But they were worried about some sort of consequence or inconvenience or problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3035.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And maybe next time they are more willing to actually stand up for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3042.05s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe next time they're more willing to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3048.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think I'll let it pass for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3635.302s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3636.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just would like to ask that when the plan is proposed, we have options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3642.648s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not like this is what we think is the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3645.791s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I thought that the process that we went through for the superintendent search was excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3651.436s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to make sure that it doesn't go to a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3654.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You guys present us a book, and we vote on it, and we're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3657.24s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's something I thoroughly hope that we can all be involved in, because these are serious decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3662.542s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I commend member Rousseau for doing research on this regard, because that's useful for me to know as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3668.924s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to maybe suggest that we add a mandate to this subcommittee, that they provide us with maybe three different plans, or... Just for general information, a feasibility study would have to happen at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4717.903s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4718.424s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Khan, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4720.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to ask some questions about illustrative math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4722.486s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4723.206s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think this is how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4726.568s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So when kids complete online exercises, all that information is recorded for you to look over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4731.39s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4734.251s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, when the online classes, that information isn't compiled globally for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4755.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, the exercises themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4756.932s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4757.372s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're not using those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4758.113s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, exercises themselves are on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4760.174s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That was my misunderstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.195s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4762.475s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense of, I remember that printouts and kids carrying binders were a key element of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.36s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.88s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of how our compliance percentage is going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4773.543s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know it's early in the year, but I remember as a math teacher, I would have a certain percentage of kids and I'd open up their bag and all the papers would come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.185s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give us a sense of how things are working so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4818.126s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, I know it's very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4878.14s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Personally, I think it's very exciting that we're trying a new program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4880.32s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just very nervous about the implementation and I just want to make sure I have a couple questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4884.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So help me understand a little bit about the pedagogy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.242s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So here we have there is a page that gives I imagine there's like a page that hits all of the modalities that they're doing sort of a guide for the lesson and then the teachers choose from like a potpourri of exercises that they feel would best fit their students that basically how these classes work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4948.237s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do we have a sense of how the teachers, so far, so good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4953.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that what we're hearing so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4979.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is there like a test that students are going to be administering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4982.446s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it sort of like all the teachers have a lot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.569s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's the PD day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5016.848s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for these reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5018.309s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate as much information about this particular program, because I'm very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5024.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6107.87s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, one last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6108.992s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I forgot to ask you this, but it's on my list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6112.055s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know what percentage of the two class books that are being taken out for children that don't have access to computers at home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6121.247s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know how many of those books are being checked out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6162.497s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I imagine just sort of with the demographics, I'm sure there's some classes that it's a much higher population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6168.881s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, are there lots of teachers saying, Faiz, I need books like now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6173.344s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are a lot of teachers bugging you about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6221.859s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I look forward to the update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6222.759s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6699.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6700.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This was, I'm speaking for myself, but I think for the other members as well, this was very important that we work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6708.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had the element of the dyscalculia, I'm mispronouncing it, of course, I'm sorry, elements of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6716.282s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do any of these screenings actually address those concerns as well, or dysgraphia is the other issue, or these are all directly, we're mostly concerned with dyslexia in these initial incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.01s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.991s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And in terms of the workshops being very competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6739.615s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the idea here is that the teacher is going to attend the PD and then they're going to come and share the ideas that they learned from these workshops to all the other teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6781.716s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6782.636s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It seems like a strange process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6784.097s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, the teachers you would expect to have the professional development would be the ones that are struggling the most to address the problem in the population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6792.702s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And while I think it's great that three teachers were selected to learn this program, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6799.105s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It'd be great if we could have all the teachers attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1427.108s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it would be great if we could have a little presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1430.35s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've seen some of the pictures of the Event Horizon Telescope and it's just amazing to actually see a black hole surrounded by all of this plasma.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1438.315s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be great if we could get a presentation to our middle school students to get them excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3264.454s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to get a sense of, do we have an idea of when the DESE guidelines will be coming out, or is that the state's unclear on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3277.921s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do we have a sense, is there like a preliminary report that's going to be anticipated, or it's just all coming out at once?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3359.19s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible that we could have one of the administrators of the program come in to speak about what their game plan and their strategy is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3365.113s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because right now it seems like everyone's sort of unclear about where this is moving, and this is a very serious issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3371.057s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, we all were very moved by the presentation that came to us about dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3379.262s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, I have no doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3380.322s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't mean to imply that people aren't taking it seriously.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3382.424s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would just be helpful to me when people call me about the issue that I have more to report other than Desi is trying a bunch of stuff out in some different communities and we'll see in a year and a half.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3406.51s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If they can't, send a personnel member, at least something they can write us, so at least we have a sense of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3412.635s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I really appreciate both of you following up on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3414.616s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4745.621s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5187.795s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much, John.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5188.616s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5190.317s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5191.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think maybe a number of months ago, the committee voted to have an inventory of all the expensive equipment as like a spreadsheet or some sort of initiative to understand where things are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5218.014s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'll get back to you on that, personally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5219.376s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5219.716s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If that's the way you prefer to do it, that's OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1167.341s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We do have that if there is like a stated emergency that would require that that the chair refuses to recognize point of clarification But but you're not saying an item not on the agenda can be discussed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1178.206s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, in terms of an emergency situation, so we do have the authority via open meeting laws to discuss those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1185.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If the chair refuses to put that emergency item on the agenda, we can force that issue to be recognized under open meeting law as long as there's a super majority and we wouldn't violate any open meeting clause if it's an emergency situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1219.652s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A supermajority would have to agree that it is an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2204.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Two questions as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2205.338s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2206.278s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first question I have was your mix of the opt-in versus the opt-out model that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2212.461s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the original screening, students are just going to have the survey if they want to fill it out or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2217.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that an option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2218.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if they get included in the study, it requires both consent of the student and the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2223.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that still the model that we're using?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2225.429s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2226.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the second question I had is, you mentioned before that it would be possible to include other questions, a couple of other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2234.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be great if we could have a question also on vaping and a question on maybe activity levels, including like diabetes and like sugary drink consumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2262.0s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, it would be nice if we could have a question about sugary drink consumption as well, because that is a really rising health cost, as you noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2284.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I don't know if this requires an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2286.703s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I also don't want to jeopardize the scientific value by including every single question under the sun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2291.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if it doesn't actually jeopardize the scientific value of your study, I would prefer questions about obesity and sugary drink consumption and activity levels to also be included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2302.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.487s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.927s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's the most important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2317.687s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2318.448s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't want you to jeopardize the scientific value of what you're doing by expanding out the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2349.662s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I don't think this requires an amendment, but if you could look into that for us, I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2361.201s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I would imagine, I mean, I'm speculating, I don't have the scientific data in front of me, but I would imagine that children that tend to be less active and also have a poorer dietary environment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2373.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: also have a higher likelihood to use marijuana.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2376.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know if I have any evidence of that, but it would seem at least sort of, you know, you imagine sort of the person smoking pot, watching TV, eating Doritos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2385.326s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that could be a cliche, or perhaps there's some scientific truth to that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2388.849s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2416.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, the reason why I mention it is I've had a couple of parents now talk to me about, you know, their child was involved in middle school sports and they were very athletic and then the vaping and the drug use came into their lives and all of that stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2431.118s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, I mean, I would be curious to see whether that correlation actually is valid or if it's just sort of like word on the street what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2439.509s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2528.074s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Free breakfast, lunch feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3291.527s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you very much for rushing out this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3294.228s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know that we all asked you to expedite it and with all the other budgetary work that you had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3299.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciate it because as I mentioned before as a former educator, I know what it's like when kids show up hungry and I've seen the effects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3307.834s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've taught at both kinds of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3309.795s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I do share Member Ruseau's reservations about not doing an after the bell program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3316.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When kids have the opportunity, if mom and dad are running late, that kid doesn't eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3321.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And one of the issues that we talked about at the superintendent review was making sure we have a consistent program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3328.292s">[Ruggiero]</a>: throughout the entire system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3330.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess the way I feel about it is that, you know, if you're a child in poverty, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Columbus or the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3336.662s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that kid's fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3338.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to suggest under this pilot, since we're running a pilot, I would like to have a consistent after the bail program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3346.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That would be what we test, not sort of we try this, we try this, we try this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3350.694s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to see what happens when the entire district has an after the bell program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3355.137s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if we have something like 90% participation, then we would know that we have an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3361.286s">[Ruggiero]</a>: seeking a second on that or has anyone else had a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3455.581s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I believe, and I understand, it's like one more thing that member Ruggiero has thrown at the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3462.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But on this particular issue, I do believe it has a significant impact on educational standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3468.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it will be seen throughout the entire school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3471.013s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would, if none of my, no one wishes to second this motion, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3474.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I would like to make a motion that we do a universal after the bell program for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3481.341s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's the one we pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3482.382s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if it doesn't work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3483.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we can't get it to work by November, then we can regroup and say, you know, it just didn't happen at the McGlynn because of rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4276.489s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4277.57s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4281.052s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I did have a question on page three of the handout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4285.103s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You mentioned our lower full inclusion rate and lower subseparate rate as compared to the state.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4291.364s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you tell me what the state average is and where we compare?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4301.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe I missed it in the wrong place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4303.487s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I couldn't find it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4304.248s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'll look for it again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4307.108s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4309.069s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are we talking like a huge difference or small difference?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5831.343s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burger.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5832.657s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One of the questions that came up when we were doing our budget discussion earlier was students, sometimes the Chromebooks will blink out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5841.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we ever have students lose data when they do the online assistant if we have a Chromebook that blinks out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5845.86s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not like they have to start from the top.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6134.577s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much, Mayor Bergen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6135.738s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6137.289s">[Ruggiero]</a>: for the report, I was hoping we could speak to Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6139.291s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Caldwell about it, but I appreciate you presenting in her stead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6143.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First off, I was curious, so in front of the curriculum committee, how many requests are made for professional development?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6156.529s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, so four were granted approval, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6190.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, because I remember when the teachers were here speaking on this very issue, they seemed to be, almost all of them, seemed to have the impression that they've presented things and they haven't had a chance to be approved on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6222.331s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I would, if possible, I would like to request a report to get a percentage of what our denial versus approval rate, but I have a couple of other questions in this regard as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6233.146s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of our tuition reimbursement, how do we compare looking at other similar school districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6353.542s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I can certainly, as a former educator myself, I've taken part of these conferences and I've learned a lot, but on the school committee I can also appreciate the stress to make sure that we have all these positions filled and if someone's away for a couple of days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6368.81s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that we can fill their spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6370.61s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess the sense that I had when TA was here is that it seemed, and many people nodded, and many people expressed their dissatisfaction with the amount of conferences that they had been approved for.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6386.354s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Now, whether that's true or not, I mean, I understand that you<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6391.112s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You think we're being very generous?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6409.619s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If possible, it would be very helpful for me, because I do have these conversations when teachers approach me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6416.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: ill-equipped to represent the district and say, no, actually, we gave 150 conferences versus Melrose, which only gave 35, or Arlington, which only gave 85.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6426.989s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be very helpful for me to understand where other districts are in this regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6432.711s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know if you have a superintendent database that you would access, but if you could do us a favor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6451.375s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't anticipate that you, everyone's busy doing graduations, and that would be a terrible time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6456.597s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But at your next superintendent conference, when you all meet, if you could pool five or six of our sister districts and say, how many do you guys give out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6465.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then you can report back those figures to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6467.402s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would help me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6468.642s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When a teacher finds me shopping at Wegmans and they're hitting me with that right now, I feel ill-equipped to represent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6475.365s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I think any teacher understands that there is a give and take, but on the other side, it's important for us to recognize that we are part of the voice of the schools, and it'd be helpful to me to have those numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6493.432s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So moved.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6496.715s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Aye.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6573.58s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=6576.309s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1101.821s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1106.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Serving issues like this is why I ran for school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1109.792s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciate you bringing this to our attention.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1112.635s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to suggest that once we move forward and remove or find a better option for our community that we all can agree on, that you find something else that you think should be improved and you keep doing it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1123.424s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because this is one of the most exciting things about serving on this board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1127.508s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So please keep speaking up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1129.709s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Your voice is welcome here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1131.051s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5331.618s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5334.079s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One issue I heard come up reputedly in your state, Charlene, was the professional development funds being rejected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5341.083s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you give me a sense of how often this happens?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5480.957s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5481.517s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5483.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion that we have a report on the percentage of professional development funds that are requested from us and what percentage we actually give to teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5495.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As a former educator myself, I know how valuable professional development time is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5500.826s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'd like to see that in writing as a report, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5507.688s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The percentage of teachers that have applied for professional development monies<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5546.652s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it, so if a teacher places, thank you, I mean I appreciate it, I just want to get a sense of what's happening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5552.114s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if a teacher makes a request for a conference or a class in the summer, that teacher's application must still be on file somewhere, correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5561.637s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Even if it's rejected, or not?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5637.488s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not that they passed the expiration date of the application.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5640.27s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's just they weren't the first in the door.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5642.091s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that what you're saying?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5643.812s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the teachers applied properly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5719.162s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So someone, let's say they went to Mass General Hospital and they wanted to receive special training to help our dyslexic students, that wouldn't necessarily be covered.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5759.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, it would be very helpful to me just to, and thank you very much for this information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5762.92s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for sharing your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5764.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we can see something physical so we can actually move forward with an educated decision.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5770.564s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we have 100 teachers applying for 10 spots, that's unacceptable in my opinion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5964.938s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I've taught AP Calculus, so I know it's not so much always just the mathematics, but it's also the ability and getting the educational instruction to teach at a high level to high school kids who are sort of in between being at college ready.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5978.401s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I know those classes are particularly challenging.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5981.887s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms, I would like to also, in addition to the report, I'd like to suggest that we review the policy in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5987.672s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, I mean, your particular case, it seems like we should be allowed a little bit of discernment, you know, especially for seniors in June.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=5995.137s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was just thinking the benefit would have been pretty big to the system as a whole, and just to have that experience, to read the AP exams, see what they're looking for, go back and tell.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6004.044s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On our teacher, we have a huge AP offering in my school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6235.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Amber, is the podium microphone on?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=6237.326s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9273.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to say briefly that it's been a real honor seeing you guys work with your energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9281.473s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's been a real pleasure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9282.733s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know we have a lot going on tonight.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9284.154s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't want to ramble on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9285.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But thank you so much for coming down and making this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11166.595s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So as an educator, former educator, I can tell you that there are students in Medford that the only time they have a real meal<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11174.227s">[Ruggiero]</a>: is at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11175.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We know that for a fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11178.511s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I share member Ruseau's energy in making sure we get this done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11185.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Our job as a school committee member is to make sure that we're devoting the right time in the right places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11190.582s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I completely understand that we can't get the research done in two weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11195.404s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But for me, I don't need to see the research, because I know that there is a significant portion of students that the only time they eat is at lunch regularly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11204.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Otherwise, they're just grabbing a snack maybe every so often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11207.571s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We need to make this a priority.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11209.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've seen the effect it has on children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11211.212s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've taught in both kinds of schools, schools where they have a lunch in homeroom and schools without it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11216.795s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I can tell you there's a marked difference.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11221.078s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Anyone else doesn't have anything else to say on this issue?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11223.5s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we can move the question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11572.008s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11573.009s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11574.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero, did you have one last comment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11575.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I withdraw my comment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11576.792s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12169.609s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So on this question, so the children pulled out the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12172.889s">[Ruggiero]</a>: the questionnaire, if they are screened as heavy users, or would it also be students that aren't screened as heavy users also be included in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12204.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, so it's going to be an equal number of non-users.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12206.071s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If a child's selected, he never has to fear that he's going, because I would wonder if that would affect the methodology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12236.46s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many students do you intend on sampling?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12251.042s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do you anticipate something like you take 125 students that are not marijuana users, 125 students that are, and that's your sample pool?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13113.117s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In addition, you mentioned that on your questionnaire you can include other activities that are unhealthy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13118.202s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like you to expand that net as wide as you possibly can without affecting your research significantly, including questions such as obesity, perhaps TV screen time use.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13127.811s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible you can include those items in your survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13162.379s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was just being mindful of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13163.835s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And secondly, if we do move away from the passive consent model, will that affect the demographics of your participation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13171.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there are certain communities that won't respond because their parents won't sign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13176.443s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's something that we have to recognize as a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13178.564s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we're going to do a truly, a true survey, perhaps passive content is the best option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13184.818s">[Ruggiero]</a>: appreciate your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13185.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no doubt that the doctor will maintain the confidentiality of all the information that the students... And we can talk about their...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13223.193s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would prefer we go down that line to address Mayor DiMendito's concerns, but that's where I am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13231.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14892.732s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just worried.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14896.693s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mary Brooke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14898.794s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So a number of things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14900.275s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First off,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14902.154s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you know, I'm a math teacher myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14904.936s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so my concern is echoed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14909.12s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm concerned that we're going to have students that don't have access to technology.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14913.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The printers aren't going to be working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14914.924s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So out of those 6th and 8th grade classes, how many students did not have a computer at home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14957.113s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So does the program take<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14959.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it monitors the students how long they are on the website, is that right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14967.323s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's say you have a student who's online, accessing to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15026.834s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just want to know, did you have a chance to make an informal poll of how teachers and middle school teachers feel about the adoption of this new program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15064.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you feel in terms of questions of morale, they're willing to follow you down?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15071.521s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd probably follow that too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15072.662s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd follow that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15073.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15073.982s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And oh, shucks, I have one last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15077.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how much do each individual workbook, how much does each one cost?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15085.387s">[Ruggiero]</a>: $26.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15085.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know you already said that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15086.228s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just getting a little foggy inside.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15089.803s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, so for us to get three copies per class is not unbelievably expensive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15102.606s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You seem to be of the opinion that let's just go with the binder method, see how it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15108.607s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we need the notebooks, later we get the notebooks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15123.831s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And just one last thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15125.092s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really do appreciate your collegial disagreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15127.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's heartwarming at 11 o'clock at night that you have an academic disagreement, but it's always for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15134.74s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that's very heartwarming to me to see that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15137.203s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15415.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2234.005s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2235.486s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, the story that you just shared with us, can you come back to the podium please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2239.868s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2243.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Your story that you shared with us is not, I mean I've talked to other parents that have had similar experiences as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2248.993s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to recommend that we, oh I'm sorry, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2253.68s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The experience that you shared with us is a story I've heard before, especially with dyslexic children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2260.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And to this end, in regards to what you've brought up, I would like to, at least maybe not tonight, if we can't get it on the agenda, but maybe we can do it another night where we can ask for a report for dyslexia, like a dyslexia audit from the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2274.775s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would something like that be possible, Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2325.721s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My concern would be just making sure that we're doing the best for curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2328.923s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate the presentation that we're going to have tonight, but it would be useful for me to understand where we are as a community versus just research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3896.18s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3897.201s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3898.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, doctor, for this very informative presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3900.821s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There are a number of things that you brought up that really interested me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3904.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One of the things I guess that concerns me, so we can expect, according to your research, we can expect 10% of the students in our school system at all grade levels are suffering from dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3917.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Of that 10%, how many, I wasn't sure if I caught it in your presentation, if I missed it, I apologize, but what percentage of students that are in that 10% category are actually aware of their dyslexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3936.845s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would they be medically diagnosed with... No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3951.995s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, let me clarify my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3953.597s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So of the 10% that have dyslexia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3957.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many have a medical, what percentage of that 10% have a medical diagnosis of dyslexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3993.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that I would like your advice on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3995.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So for the students that are in the sixth grade, the seventh grade, they've moved beyond their optimal time for treatment, and they're sort of, they went through the wait to fail model, I guess, and they're in the fifth grade, sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4008.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What steps should we take to address those students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4059.026s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You mentioned the tablet program that you're developing right now on an iPad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4064.349s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What sort of training is necessary for teachers to quickly and adequately spot dyslexia early on so they can get the best treatment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4108.722s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How long does this little iPad quiz take or game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4144.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be something that we could maybe Xerox off and just let the kids play with for 20 minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.441s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4661.244s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4662.645s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, just a follow-up question on the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4665.627s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we could just sort of work towards having an audit of where we are with the various dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4672.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Our next presentation is going to address many of these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5998.654s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5999.976s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So currently at the Roberts, can you tell me how many students have IEPs based on dyslexia right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6013.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And is this for all the elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6019.083s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you have a ballpark figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6028.163s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So let's add that to the report as well, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6056.897s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, yeah, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6058.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it just seems back of the envelope, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6060.799s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we have around 2,000 kids in our elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6064.28s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we know, at least based on the research, what we've heard, that's about 200 kids that are suffering with it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6071.644s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, I mean, the question is, I would like to know, how many of those kids have educational plans in place right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6079.307s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think that this... For dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6085.748s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, that's right, because that's what we're, the idea here is trying to address this issue, just making sure that we know where we're at, because I'm getting a sense that maybe we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8704.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Motion to enter Executive Session to deal with the legal matters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8708.897s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We still have some items left on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1030.155s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1031.536s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of the landscaping, I want to know, is it possible that we could create maybe a small scholarship for students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1038.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we can open up to them for a design contest, maybe something like $1,000, $2,000 scholarship to college or a college bond.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1047.431s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we could allow our students to actually present ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1051.234s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is such a program like that possible, Madam Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1106.629s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah I really like the idea that I mean of course we could always go out to bid and have a bunch of professionals look at it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1113.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think it'd be a really fun project for a number of students to actually have an opportunity to have like a little contest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1119.075s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe it's not a scholarship maybe it's an award and a plaque that we present at a school committee meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1125.418s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But regardless I'd like to make a motion that we explore this option with the superintendent and she can come back with to us with a report at her leisure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2015.209s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you tell me logistically how composting will work with high school students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3588.541s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, thank you very much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3590.542s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just out of curiosity, so reading through the manifest here, and when I read the floor is fair poor, is there a risk that children will be injured using it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3639.25s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How old is the floor exactly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4014.452s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Giro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4017.775s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just, because I'm a little confused still, so let me ask again.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4020.537s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So will the floor be safe for next year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4024.497s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we didn't fund this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4036.689s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4038.25s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that if we do do it this year that it needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4042.033s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5573.19s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5574.611s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for this report, Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5576.752s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really enjoyed reading through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5578.512s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do have a question about your major and emerging scenes section on page 13.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5582.075s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to know, so obviously we all know that the scheduling issue between the vocational school and the high school is not acceptable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5592.683s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess, and I also know it's going to be a thorny problem to untangle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5597.006s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to know what is your timetable and schedule for addressing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5600.329s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How long do you think it'll take?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5693.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: do you anticipate a lot of, for lack of a better word, pushback from the unions on the change?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5000.682s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just would like to also recommend that we put the lottery date for the middle school selection also on this calendar, if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7159.285s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7162.287s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've noticed this on page five here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7164.008s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7164.888s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's a significant drop from grade three to grade four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7169.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What do you believe?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7170.971s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Why is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7238.42s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you have a sense of, in the past when we've had these breakdowns, we've been able to see which schools have been performing at what levels.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7246.226s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you have a sense, are there any,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7249.208s">[Ruggiero]</a>: disparities between different schools on these?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7251.45s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's in the first report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7264.081s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7264.902s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, the new one that was on the desk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7267.063s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7267.404s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7268.605s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7269.265s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I didn't catch it in the envelope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7425.444s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7429.158s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, yeah, follow-up question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7431.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you very much for this that you give us today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7433.239s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But is it possible that we could look at, in the future, or perhaps with the report that you're sending to Member Ruseau, is it possible you could do a per-subject breakdown per school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7443.661s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we could see that maybe we could get a couple more measurement and data specialists at the Columbus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7449.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That would be useful for me to see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7450.843s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7451.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just like you've provided the aggregate data per school, it would be very useful for me to know per subject on each school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7464.286s">[Ruggiero]</a>: By strength, like geometry, measurement data, fractions, all of these, I guess, subtopics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7469.848s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be nice to know the breakdown per school as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7472.709s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7473.569s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7474.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Member Ruseau, would it be okay if I added that to your motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7482.104s">[Ruggiero]</a>: make another motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7482.785s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, then I'd like to, or unless we have to, sorry, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7486.427s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to make a motion that we have the breakdown for schools that are at the convenient, by topic, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=7508.324s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, we remember.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9043.511s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9044.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciated the executive summary here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9047.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can we just go to page four of your report, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9049.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9050.784s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So just sort of walk me through this table at the bottom of page four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9054.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there are a number of domains and clusters that are associated with them, and these are the highlights, the areas that we need work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9061.395s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that basically the end?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9087.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But you don't get a whole table that says item 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9109.431s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9110.392s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be just useful to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9111.492s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, there's no rush on this, but if we could get like a PDF, save the paper of all the different items and the districts and state scores, it would just be helpful for me just to get a more complete sense of what's going on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9124.181s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate the executive summary and not like a thick binder of problem, you know, issues that we can look on now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9129.444s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But at home, it would be nice for me to look over these domain by domain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9134.647s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if we could break that down by school, I mean, is it challenging to break down by school or just a printout?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9140.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be really helpful to me to see what areas that we could, perhaps there might be an environment that we could leverage someone in the community that has experience with something, for example, molecules to organisms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5080.548s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd just like to know a little bit about the Massachusetts Coalition for the Management of Concussions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5086.37s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Who's going to, is there a neurologist going to be presenting at that event?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5090.011s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't have, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5093.112s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5910.689s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5912.049s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I stand in opposition to this plan for many of the reasons that Member Ruseau mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5918.931s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First off, I think that it's part of my fiduciary responsibility to the city of Medford to review these items in part of our working group.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5927.293s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I feel like this can be done as in committee of the whole and I dislike the idea that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5935.235s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If I attend these meetings, it will be simply informational.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5939.718s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With all due respect to members that are on this committee, I'm sure they do a great job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5943.781s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think I owe it to the citizens of Medford to be able to speak on these matters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5950.926s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I dislike the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5952.587s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I understand that items that come to us,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5956.23s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We would have the opportunity, it would come to us as an omnibus agreement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5960.914s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And yeah, I think that this is the wrong direction while I understand the attempt and the idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5966.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I believe that all of us should be present at these meetings and it's very possible perhaps we could schedule these from 6 to 7.30 before Monday or other times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6018.182s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, while I completely understand your point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6025.535s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's part of my job.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6027.136s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's difficult for me to, it was difficult for me to attend today's committee of the whole, but I made it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6032.099s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was, other members couldn't come in at exactly the right time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6035.101s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They were five or six minutes late.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6036.982s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's understandable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6037.762s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are important matters, and I do believe that our entire meeting should deliberate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6460.95s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that there's a number of items I wish to address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6464.032s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first was the question, well, what's this personnel subcommittee for?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6468.737s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, in my opinion, a great use for it would be to decide if we want a badminton coach and a conversation about a team or a new team and how that individual personnel should be hired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6484.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The underlying premise that seven of us can't sit down together and have a thoughtful conversation about these topics is somewhat, for lack of a better word, almost offensive to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6493.866s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6495.548s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not like seven of us can't get into a room.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6498.25s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A quorum of our subcommittee is four people, for God's sakes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6502.694s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If Kathy can't be there because of a family emergency, we'll survive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6506.817s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, this body will continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6509.738s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But in terms of questions of collaboration and conversation, I'm excited that our new superintendent wants to create a more transparent process, and I support the motivation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6520.921s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And while I am very frustrated by this proposal, I understand where it comes from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6526.203s">[Ruggiero]</a>: However, I do not, we can all sit down in a committee of a whole or if we needed something less formalized, we could do something like a dialogue that we had earlier in the year where we can just sort of throw ideas on the board and see what sticks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6543.71s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is within our purview.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6546.251s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I also do believe with respect to member Rousseau that we are not the weirdo in this case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6553.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think actually using,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6555.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: a process where the community has an opportunity to see what's going on in front of a camera versus a subcommittee meeting which might not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6564.944s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think that that fosters added senses of transparency for the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6570.77s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So again, while I'm very frustrated by this proposal and I do believe it's the wrong direction,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6578.057s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand the motivation, and I appreciate the idea that you want to create a more collaborative, a more transparent environment, but we have a forum to have collaborative conversations in a transparent environment, and this is it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6688.524s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean do we have a quorum for a committee if I'll go I mean look I mean The chair right now<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6921.657s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In the evening, if possible, at 6 o'clock, sometime around that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6969.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6970.011s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sorry, Nicole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6971.294s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Wasn't she in earlier?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6972.476s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had her up at the podium.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7608.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm interested in your mentioning about the assessment that's going to be at the graduation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7615.51s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So is this an assessment similar to the MCAS?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7617.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that going to be the design paradigm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7672.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also assume new educational materials will have to be purchased.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7683.201s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Has the state offered any financial support?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7726.714s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7727.374s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7730.054s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Have DESE published the core curriculum, the actual topics that will be tested on this exam, like the different modalities?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1850.118s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for all these meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1852.261s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just was curious, how many times do you anticipate on meeting?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1864.715s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If possible, I mean, I would really like to attend these meetings because I'm very interested in this particular topic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1870.546s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would prefer it to be as a committee of the whole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=1873.268s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand perhaps we could vote on that now or we could discuss that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4897.053s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This was a major issue to me when I was campaigning for school committee, and I'm really glad to see the beginning motions of resolving the problem, especially the economic and social disparities between the two schools I've always found very troubling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4911.278s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do have a couple of questions about it, however.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4914.682s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Given that some teachers have after school programs at some schools versus other, will students at the McGlynn be able to take an after school program at the Andrews and vice versa?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4954.779s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And also I was concerned before the issue was joining the two schools or having a random lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4961.217s">[Ruggiero]</a>: was that there were programmatic reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4963.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For example, English learners were assigned to one school and other environments.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4967.482s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Will those considerations still apply?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5010.677s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I think there's a lot of, I think ultimately this will be this, unless we make a true difference between the two schools, where one has a magnet for one environment and another has a magnet for another environment, which is an option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5022.29s">[Ruggiero]</a>: perhaps we should explore, but this probably is the fairest option to make sure that we don't have the same economic disparities that we have now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5029.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: However, I would like to know more about the rollout of this program, and I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we talk more about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5037.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's excellent, and I think this is a great start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5040.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just would like to have more material at hand to see sort of all the steps and implementation, and I want to make sure we can have a forum for community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5048.792s">[Ruggiero]</a>: before we make an official vote on this plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5054.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to understand a little bit more about the implementation, and I would like to make sure that the community has an opportunity to buy into the process versus something that's just a surprise at the end of the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5064.102s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because people are right now, at least two years ago, we're used to being able to choose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5069.146s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that's something that we are going to say, well, you know, it wasn't working for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5073.349s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're changing the program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5074.589s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Here's why.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5075.973s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that the community has an opportunity to participate in that conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5081.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So is there a second for my motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5757.417s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My concern is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5759.798s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that we absolutely, most of us can agree that the system that we have now is not working.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5766.222s">[Ruggiero]</a>: is I think that there's another option that might be worth exploring, and that would have a magnet school for one environment, and a magnet school for, let's say, math or science, and a magnet school for language arts or humanities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5783.73s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand completely, but it would be, once again, to get a sense of rollout, I think is important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5788.592s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if you have four friends, and you have a cohort of four peers that you've always been with,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5795.515s">[Ruggiero]</a>: for whatever reason, it's not mathematically impossible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5798.578s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's probable that there will be groups of friends split up where one kid's at one school and the rest of the group's at the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5805.004s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's just going to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5806.906s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And these are options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5808.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're making the right choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5810.983s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If this is a one-year kind of deal while we discuss other things, I'd be a little bit more comfortable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5816.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But once again, I mean, I certainly share the superintendent's concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5821.126s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was an important issue for me during the campaign.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5823.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's still an important issue for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5825.728s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're doing this in the right way and exploring all options versus like, oh, this is the new normal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5832.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's all do it now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6681.064s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of questions that still are up in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6686.33s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, for example, how we are doing some programmatic switches between some kids, if they have EL, are going to go to this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6694.6s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some kids with other needs are going to go to this school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6697.703s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, these issues are up in the air.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6699.545s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I have complete faith<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6701.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: in the superintendent, I think it's important for us to suss these questions out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6706.227s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Member Mustone, I completely understand your frustration, and I know that you just want to go, and I get it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6712.551s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I don't think delaying this two weeks, a week and a half, for us to have a committee of the whole is going to destroy the program rollout.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6721.778s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6722.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that it would be important for us to take a breath.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6725.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have a problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6727.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: but to take a beat, think about this problem all together, and we're probably all going to, once we answer our questions, we're probably all going to agree that this is the right, this is the best thing for Medford, perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6738.91s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think that we do need a little more time to think about this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6760.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're not talking about five months.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8069.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8072.815s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm very impressed by it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8074.276s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The idea of emergency preparedness is important to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8077.457s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And as you mentioned, it's important to think of it when times are good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8080.758s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And oftentimes, it's easy to forget that there are students, like you mentioned, sometimes they trip and fall, and they just have trouble walking for a little bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8087.6s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And other students that need a little bit more assistance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8091.801s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Madam Superintendent, do we have a district-wide emergency preparedness committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8097.443s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And would one be able to be formed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8123.477s">[Ruggiero]</a>: where we were talking about safety in place.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8127.299s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you think that such an implementation would be possible for you to do with your staff?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8138.226s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to make a motion to send this to the superintendent for report to see if we could convene a district-wide emergency preparedness committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8146.452s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And also to forward these recommendations to her so she could report back to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8150.613s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that there's a lot of great work here, and I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8153.254s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=743.404s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Before the tabling, I just have a couple of questions about the formatting, because I had a similar concern or idea, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=749.165s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible, if not department heads, or different departments, is it possible for us to list the departments that they receive their paycheck from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=874.709s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=874.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you still ask questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=876.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm just trying to understand the data frames that you draw this from.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=880.527s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So to pull out this spreadsheet here, these columns, you drew that from your payroll system, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=907.701s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I guess the reason why I'm trying to understand the challenge of this<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=910.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have these numbers also cross-referenced to another data frame that where the warrants are drawn from that pay all these people, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=923.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm trying to understand is that if there's someone being paid, let's say, in the high school,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=931.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do they draw their check?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=932.919s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They draw their check from just payroll and that's where it's come from?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=936.721s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or does it go that there's a warrant drawn from the high school and that goes to pay off the payroll?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=969.844s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess what I'm trying to understand is, because I've worked with a little data myself, so I'm trying to understand why is it difficult to pull out the department?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=977.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because I would imagine that these numbers must correspond to a different data set that you have, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1023.731s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I understand that there must be many different data frames, but what I'm trying to understand is why is it, I still, maybe it's just because my head's so thick here, so maybe you could just go through it with me a couple of times.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1035.412s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if, and I'm not saying that this is the case, but let's say there's Dr., I don't know, Ghostface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1041.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do, you know, someone who just ended up in the payroll system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1044.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You hear about stories about this every so often.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1046.919s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You read the news that there's some mystery person that's been drawing payroll for years and years and years, even though they're not on the system anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1053.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That couldn't happen to us, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1063.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you know they're active?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1134.731s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We approve this every week, so I just want to make sure I'm crystal clear on the process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1192.959s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand that people might have different deductions, and that changes the gross wages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1199.243s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I completely understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1200.924s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I'm having trouble understanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1206.607s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1206.987s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1207.427s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1208.188s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm trying to understand is, so there's data coming to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1212.283s">[Ruggiero]</a>: then you filter that data and make this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1214.244s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's no column about where that person works or what that person's title or role is in the company?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1230.529s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What are the data frames?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1232.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I'm trying to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1264.558s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My challenge here is it seems that there must be some sort of data frame of some sort, whether it's something like some SQL database or some database where this employee has all the facts about that employee are in a column on some sort of database.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1290.494s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What's the format of the database?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1311.97s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With all due respect, so the only assurance that we have that we don't have some sort of ghost member on the payroll is that the program tells us so?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1349.691s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1350.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to make clear to everyone, I'm not implying that I think that there's any malfeasance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1356.175s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1356.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I'm trying to understand is the difficulty in drawing the data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1360.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because for me, I would, whatever data frame you're working on, you should be able to draw these columns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1368.586s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and the columns come out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1370.047s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, that's all the database experience I've ever had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1390.699s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So they would just have multiple entries on the column.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1394.341s">[Ruggiero]</a>: See, that seems to be the solution to the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1396.339s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you had someone who works at both the Andrews and the Roberts, they would just have a comma in between the two places.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1408.47s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I mean, we have a fiduciary responsibility to the voters of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1413.074s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's our job, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1414.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's what we vote on, is to make sure that these people vote here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1419.331s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The idea is that we have a report, but you're missing a key actual value on this data frame, which is to know where this person works in our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1430.14s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have, you know, there are many, many names here, and I'm sure they all work hard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1433.743s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm not, I wanna make absolutely clear, I'm not implying anything, but on the same token,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1440.257s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, there's a crucial, I mean, why not just, why have the employee number or even the name?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1646.461s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With all due respect to your point, which I understand where you're coming from, we don't have to take the entire population and test it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1652.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We would test a sample.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1654.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we could take 30 people from this list, and I could double check it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1659.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That would give me a reasonable set of understanding, well, I picked 30 names at random off this list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1665.705s">[Ruggiero]</a>: All these people work here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1666.725s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That would give me much more confidence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1668.605s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because right now, there's no way for me to find any of these people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1674.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that, but if I knew that, for example, let's say Michael Ruggiero, I don't want to name any names off the list, but let's say Michael Ruggiero, he works, he's a math teacher at the Roberts, that I would say, he's one of the names that I randomly drew from this page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1688.274s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I can check it if all 30 go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1693.056s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, I don't have to test an entire population to get some information about that population, man.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1701.44s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2712.649s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2714.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had a question about the vaping that you have on Thursday, February 7th.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2721.95s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How is this event being advertised to parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2882.709s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know, Madam Mayor, do you know for the Education Promise Act, do you know the house number?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2890.51s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3241.798s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3242.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3242.659s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burkett, but also Madam Superintendent, it would be interesting to know how many parents or families have been affected by the government shutdown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3249.901s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I've been hearing that there have been a lot of reports, sort of, no one affected by me directly, but sort of secondhand information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3258.304s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it'd be interesting to know if we could do more, either through Priscilla's Pantry, if we could figure something out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4009.199s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry to keep giving you little corrections or suggestions to the board.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4015.304s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is on the second page under section one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4019.707s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible you could just include the exact URL that they need to download it so they could just click on that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4026.372s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It says medfordpublicschools.org.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4027.873s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you just do the black slash?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4029.654s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because our website can be a little difficult, especially for someone who has limited English skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4037.812s">[Ruggiero]</a>: More detailed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4040.234s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Such as myself, perhaps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4041.815s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And with that, I'd like to recommend that we put this online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4045.458s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4930.348s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And maybe this will be covered in the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4932.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I didn't see it here on the slide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4934.89s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you give us like the top five languages spoken by percent, is that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4954.073s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give us a sense of how many students speak Arabic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4960.135s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The reason why I ask is for the prior mentioned kindergarten affair might be if we have a large percentage of Arabic speakers it might be useful to have translators for them available as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4971.057s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's possible we could find someone in the community that would be willing to volunteer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4978.728s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4979.368s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is not your, this is the prior presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4983.029s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know if we have many Arabic-speaking kindergarten students or first grade students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5000.614s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you find that information out for us next time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5002.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it would be interesting for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5488.115s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've only been looking at the English.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5695.229s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These statistics are really concerning to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5697.25s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These aren't unique to Medford, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5705.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5705.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're looking at an epidemic of obesity in this country, which have, as everyone here I'm sure knows, has long-lasting health effects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5713.24s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'd like to suggest to the committee that we create a community of the whole when possible, perhaps whenever you think we could put together something to see how we could tackle this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5725.248s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps we could welcome in some experts in childhood obesity to speak with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5732.175s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because there have to be some schools in America that are beginning to figure this problem out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5740.062s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We can't do nothing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5742.745s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For children to have these issues going forward, they might have health issues the rest of their life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5770.558s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I want to clarify.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5771.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I didn't mean to imply that you're not doing anything.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5773.859s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That was the wrong idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5775.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This statistic is deeply frustrating to me, because I know how this can affect children as a prior educator myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5781.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I also know the health outcomes that children with this condition, once those fat cells are in there, they have to fight them their whole life.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5791.042s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I really hope that we could do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5793.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm looking for a second on the motion, if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5799.458s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just to repeat the motion, the motion is to have a committee of the whole to address what policies we can put in place to tackle the obesity epidemic in our district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5830.941s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think we have a nutrition subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5832.902s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The curriculum would be the closest I can think of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5834.942s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think it would be best served if we were all there to talk about this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5838.604s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because we're looking at almost 300 kids that are either overweight or obese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5844.025s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the obesity rates, we're looking at like 250 kids here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5847.446s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's just my back of the envelope calculation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5849.627s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that's a scary statistic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5854.48s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The health outcomes of these children are severe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5857.063s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And whatever kind of solutions we have to think of outside of the box, welcome in other committees that maybe have some ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=5865.013s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really hope that we as a committee can at least begin to think outside the box on this one, because America is, we're having trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2352.76s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2355.502s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just a question on the chain of command here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2358.967s">[Ruggiero]</a>: this new person will be reporting directly to you and will act independently.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2364.41s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what will the sort of relationship be between this person and the superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4833.685s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One of the interesting factors I would like to discuss more about is vaping of cannabis oils.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4839.346s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of that increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4842.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it seems to me that's even a bigger problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4845.748s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or do you think it's of the same magnitude?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4914.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense of how the rate has been increasing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4943.359s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's no sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7285.686s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7286.647s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Seeing that these products are all illegal, do we have any sense of where kids are getting them from or how the distribution networks are happening in the high schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7549.753s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do you think that it's simply the case where kids are just going into community stores, or is it just some kids have access and they're buying a bunch of it and then distributing it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7600.742s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what's the penalty for selling to a minor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=1993.285s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3496.933s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3499.276s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of consequences and what the consequences are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3503.28s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And this is something we debated back and forth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3505.673s">[Ruggiero]</a>: According to Robert's Rules of Order, we have the authority now, whether we sign the document or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3511.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what is activity on becoming a member is actually a subjective element.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3517.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The idea, though, is censure has, you are ultimately responsible to the members of Medford, and the citizens of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3528.062s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what you say is not, while we can censor you, it's what your authority is to the people of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3535.207s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, I mean, the idea, we wanted to add some element that we debated this idea back and forth quite a bit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3543.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Ultimately, we came down on the idea that there should be some sort of provision for a member that we felt acts in violation with the things that we're signing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3552.793s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3661.995s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mrs. DeVantage, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3692.635s">[Ruggiero]</a>: safety involvement and volunteering, but that's something we're still doing some more research on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3697.397s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There are three papers that we would like to have considered in the entire meeting, so I'll just go through the first of them right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3705.401s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first item that was referred to us many months ago was about digital documents being posted online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3712.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Currently, many parents have asked me to post items personally, but we as a committee felt it would be best if we had a unified policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3722.109s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, originally we wanted to do a number of research, which we did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3726.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, we spoke with Dorothy Presser.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3728.893s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She's our representative for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3733.835s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She has no official position.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3736.316s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's no official guidance on digital documents being posted online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3741.279s">[Ruggiero]</a>: However, she hasn't heard any negative feedback from the communities that do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3746.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They also don't track it, but she said probably a sizable minority, maybe 40%, maybe 30% of communities do post online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3756.912s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So after that, I called a number of different school committees and mostly superintendent's offices to see their position and see<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3766.462s">[Ruggiero]</a>: what effect it had in their community posting these documents online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3771.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There were basically four major areas that I asked them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3776.064s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, I asked them to describe their posting process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3778.825s">[Ruggiero]</a>: All of the communities I had a chance to talk to had different processes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3783.205s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Second, I asked, did it help or hurt the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3786.226s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what problems have you had in the implementation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3789.127s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thirdly, I asked, what system did you use to post?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3792.407s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, I asked, did they have any unforeseen problems that arose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3797.688s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In short, all the communities I spoke to felt very positively about posting documents online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3803.83s">[Ruggiero]</a>: None reported any significant problems from people using documents in a way that was not becoming or productive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3814.312s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, I spoke with some people at Melrose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3818.093s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I spoke to Diane Hogan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3819.333s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She's the assistant to the superintendent there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3821.874s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Overall, she believed that they had a positive experience of posting packets online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3826.736s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Their community posted packets 72 hours in advance, and they use a program called Grayness, which is used by the entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3838.939s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Diane, or Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3839.739s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Hogan, believed it helped the community in real time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3842.488s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And they've been doing it since 2012.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3843.589s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They also felt that there's a tendency for rumors to sort of spread through a community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3850.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But with the digital documents there, she felt that those kind of rumors were stymied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3856.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I left a message with the people at Danvers, but they weren't able to get back to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3860.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I also called a couple of other districts and weren't able to get back to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3865.767s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But the people at Redding, whose name, the last name of this lady I unfortunately forgot to write down, her name was Linda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3871.853s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She was also an executive assistant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3874.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She believed that they had a very positive experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3877.298s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They posted 48 hours in advance of meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3881.282s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And they used PDFs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3882.743s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So they don't, they do not pay for any expensive system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3885.726s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They just post PDFs online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3888.813s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Franklin Public Schools, I spoke to Denise Miller.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3892.337s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They've had also a very positive experience with posting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3895.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They felt like there were no problems with doing anything online.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3900.187s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What they did was a system, actually I'm going to recommend that we do, they send a link<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3904.633s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to school committee members first.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3907.056s">[Ruggiero]</a>: School committee members have a few hours to review the materials in advance, and then the link is sent to the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3915.704s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They don't send presentations or superintendent notes beforehand, and they also use just PDFs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3922.15s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Finally, I spoke to the people at Lexington.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.072s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.392s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Calvino is the executive assistant there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3927.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She was the most enthusiastic about posting documents online in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3932.676s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She felt that it was very helpful to members of the community, and she would have actually parents call her back if they were spelling errors or typos online, so that was something that they had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3942.522s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She believes lots of parents use the documents and look forward to the packets to make sure that when they come to school committee meetings, they're prepared in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3951.947s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She did have or their community had a little problem with posting PDFs on a timetable that the community understood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3960.132s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So they just recommend that maybe we have a trial period first to make sure that all the wrinkles are ironed out and yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3968.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's no confusion about when things are posted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3972.577s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So our committee unanimously voted to do a similar program as they do in Franklin.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3980.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We would like there to be a link sent to all school committee members at 12 noon to all school committee members, and then a link sent to the community at large at 4 p.m.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3992.898s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These links would be in our entire packets, but what is confidential or materials that need to be presented and put in context?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4004.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, we haven't voted on the minutes yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4007.808s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4009.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We voted to send it to school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4011.891s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wasn't sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4012.391s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can we send?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4021.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, we haven't voted on those minutes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4023.952s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I believe at this point we've done a good amount of research on this issue and we can move this forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4038.181s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you need the minutes for this meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.22s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.94s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4177.08s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just, I'm a little confused on the logistics of this matter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4180.381s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the minutes of the meeting haven't been posted because we haven't voted on our last meeting yet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4189.243s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We did vote at the end of our meeting to send these, to send the digital documents meeting forward to the whole committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4196.184s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's two items I would like to be reviewed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4199.114s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that we vote for the meet and greet, and two, also, that we start posting digital documents online, which we've cleared with the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4206.936s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That shouldn't be a problem to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1795.558s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much, Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1797.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was really heartened by your section about mathematics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1802.44s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps it's close to my heart, as you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1805.941s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would really be interested, if possible, when you do have meetings with Lesley University about scheduling the tutor program, I'd be interested if I could sit in on those meetings or at least be forwarded on that process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1817.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm very excited.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1818.598s">[Ruggiero]</a>: about the partnership moving forward, and I think there's a great potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1822.04s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd be curious to see what they have to think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3005.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, this is a really great event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3008.621s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just so proud, Marcie, for being selected.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3011.183s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was just curious, was there some sort of competition?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3043.482s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be just so wonderful if you guys could put together a little YouTube video or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3077.63s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If I can make one small suggestion, I know a number of Medford residents at the senior center served at World War II.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3084.853s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it would be really, really great if you guys could come down and talk to them about the whole process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3088.955s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe even get some donation money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3538.673s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, thank you for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3539.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also really enjoyed the breakdowns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3542.415s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was really curious, though, when I originally read this, about the ratio of special education students in pre-K.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3550.143s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It seemed like that's a pretty big chunk of the population, or is that a normal?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3554.907s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Once again, the male to female ratio seemed a little different, or am I reading the report wrong?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3614.415s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that mandated by the state or is that via funding issue or is that just our policy in general?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3665.14s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great, thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4921.756s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm all set.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4923.923s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I would also like to know participation rates in the different activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4927.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just so, obviously, if we have one chess kid and that kid costs a million dollars, like a crazy example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4933.227s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it would tell me a lot more about the program and participation rates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4936.609s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I do have other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4939.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was curious about, on page six of nine, about the math teacher allocation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4944.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In particular, I was interested in the Andrews Middle School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4947.474s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I noticed here that the budget there<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4951.772s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that we've exceeded the budget significantly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4953.773s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to know what the situation was there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4981.175s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It just seems like, once again, talking about parity at our middle schools, when you have this page six of nine, when you have one school getting almost $120,000 more from math teachers, that's... So, again, it's about replacement.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5016.176s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would just be nice to understand what's happening there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5020.298s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And this question is, I recognize you're very, very busy and you have lots going on, especially at this time of year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5027.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I wanted to know, do we have a sense of different school districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5032.103s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that a report that would be easily found by you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5038.906s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, I'm not asking you to cook it up yourself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5042.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But is there some sort of database of different school systems that have breakdowns as fine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5053.43s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And for the closeouts and everything?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5055.939s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be really interesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5057.06s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I guess it's a question of I'll do the research myself then.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5059.602s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But this report itself, when you created it, was this one program that generated all these numbers?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5071.672s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible that you could create or email us the report when you create this as a machine-readable format?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5078.257s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be a little easier for me if I do the district-by-district analysis.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5109.983s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it a giant burden for you to send us this report as a machine-readable PDF?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5114.767s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that an easy thing where it's just Control-P and it's sent out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5136.093s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, but then I'll have to code something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5141.638s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's a little Python playdough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1891.046s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1891.926s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have the overweight and obesity statistic together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1894.827s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you have a sense of what the obesity statistic is for children in the fourth grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1915.774s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would be also interested to know different grades as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1949.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the fourth grade has a particular problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=1992.488s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, the health effects of childhood obesity are significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2000.417s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For me, I think that this is a conversation I would like to have more of, if possible, especially thinking of solutions that we could do, whether it's a question of looking at our lunch program or looking at more activities for children, because these are some frightening statistics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2020.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: 20% of America's children are obese, not overweight, but obese.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2047.458s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you think the lunch program in particular could be explored?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2051.582s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like we offer pizza every day at the high school, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2057.687s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I would personally, if we could, find time for it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2060.13s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know we're having a busy, but if we could find time on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2062.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd really like to consider this problem, because I think we have a serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2102.078s">[Ruggiero]</a>: complete child, the statistics broken down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2104.721s">[Ruggiero]</a>: By grade?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2105.421s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, by grade, but not just overweight, but also by obesity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2108.825s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if possible, I would like to really have a full conversation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2112.52s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, you don't do overweight?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2122.003s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I mean, that would at least be a start.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2126.804s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just want to know how many are, because the differences between overweight can be a pound.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2132.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But obese, that means you're walking into adulthood with a one in three chance of having type 2 diabetes, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2138.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's a serious problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2139.809s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's a lifelong condition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3104.711s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3105.992s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3107.853s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just recently finished William Dersowitch's book, Excellent Sheep.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3111.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and it talks about this idea of the raising rates of anxiety and depression among children and students in America.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3117.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to know, do we compile statistics about reported incidences of depression in our school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3158.661s">[Ruggiero]</a>: for children of a certain socioeconomic class, they might not necessarily have access to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3164.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just curious, like, when children come in and report a scenario or report suicidal thoughts, for example, is that information recorded?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3208.671s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's like a fourth of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3210.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, like an eighth of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3233.403s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3236.044s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Statistically, it's 20%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3237.824s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And is that what we found with the surveys, where students self-reporting that statistic?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3242.866s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On the survey, do you say, I have suicidal thoughts, for example?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3245.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that on the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3274.956s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do you have a sense of how that's changed over time, or is that number remaining consistent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3287.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it would be very helpful for me if we could look for a report, while we're doing the obesity report, if we could have sort of a health day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3295.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be interesting for me to see reports and statistics about obesity, statistics about mental health, and also statistics about drug use as well, because I would like to see sort of the many different comorbidities, I guess, of health in our system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3314.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, okay, great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3339.732s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you have a sense if children are self-medicating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3342.055s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If they're using alcohol, for example, to treat their depression?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3360.517s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To the chair, Dr. Edward-Vincent, are these statistics provided to the state versus different school systems?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3368.382s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be interesting for me to know how Arlington is doing, how Medford's doing, how Somerville's doing, like our sister cities in the neighborhood.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3375.947s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What are the health factors of those districts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3379.73s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would they report to the state?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3413.7s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it would be interesting for me to, maybe we could request that from the Department of Education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3419.143s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Public health.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3420.084s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, public health or education.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3421.425s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm not sure where the data would be compiled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3423.666s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it would be very interesting for me to know how we're doing, and especially in regards to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3428.312s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like I said, other factors that maybe if we improved diet, we'd also help depression, help drug use as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=3436.634s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4063.621s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4064.621s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just like everyone else, I've attended good PD days and terrible PD days.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4068.543s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How did we do last year?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4092.147s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, that's what I was curious about, the survey response.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4137.558s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4138.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I wanted to know, how often does the PD committee meet the professional development committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4156.025s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4156.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so did you pick out these workshops yourself or did you work with the superintendent to find these workshops?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=4181.252s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, thank you very much for putting it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5932.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yet when I decided to run for school committee, one main question motivated me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5938.011s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Simply stated, I wondered, with over 4,000 students and $58 million in assets, why are most school committee meetings so poorly attended by parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5949.999s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Before I ran, I feared that it is as they say on TV.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5953.902s">[Ruggiero]</a>: People were simply disinterested and disengaged in local politics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5959.356s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But knocking on thousands of doors, a passion and brilliance drove me to continue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5965.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: After a few months, an obvious answer arose.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5969.306s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was our timing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5971.408s">[Ruggiero]</a>: People have amazing energy and ideas to help drive our schools forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5975.912s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But 7 o'clock on a Monday is a challenging, if not almost impossible time for many parents to voice their opinions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5984.82s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Dozens of parents have voiced support for a biannual weekend meeting such as I have proposed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5992.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But tonight's meeting time came into conflict with, and these are real responses I got from tonight, late night work schedules that just came up, the parent-teacher conference that are coming up, bedtimes, family dinner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6005.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thus, I suggest we hold a meeting when parents can attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6010.535s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you can hear in the resolution, I suggest two meetings held on perhaps a Saturday afternoon every year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6018.144s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I propose we create an idea fair of sorts on important topics such as addressing our budget or energizing after school activities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6027.703s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The goals and themes of these meetings can be chosen by our committee and our superintendent to ensure that we are generating momentum to projects that we already have in the works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6038.727s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I hope that we can really move forward real school committee meetings, where great ideas can begin to get some action.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6046.891s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Additionally, I would like to invite Corey Check members of the PTO to help with child care, entertainment, and food during the event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6054.554s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With these amenities,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6055.935s">[Ruggiero]</a>: busy parents don't have to wrestle dinner or childcare for frisky kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6060.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Personally, I would love to see these events catered by our new bistro.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6064.801s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But most importantly, I would like volunteer groups and PTOs associated with our schools to advertise opportunities for people to contribute.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6073.647s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Clay Shirky coined the phrase cognitive surplus to describe the untapped energy and talent people have available after work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6082.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I honestly believe<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6084.062s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that the city of Medford contains hundreds of scientists that would love to open up and help out with STEM students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6091.41s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Hundreds of artists ready to inspire.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6093.693s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Dozens of CEO dads and professor moms ready to open up their business and labs, if only asked at a time when they aren't at work or tucking in their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6104.157s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Before we open the floor, I want to acknowledge that I've left a lot of the details and dates of these meetings open to discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6110.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know that our superintendent has to work out the details, and I hope to work with her as we move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6116.5s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Seeing that we are almost up to Christmas, perhaps only one meeting this year is possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6123.282s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I'm really excited about this proposal, and I can assure you many, many parents feel like that this would be a great addition to our school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6131.204s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6145.264s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've done a little broad research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6147.045s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know that some private schools have done it in the past.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6149.788s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When I was a teacher, private schools would hold a weekend open house backslash.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6208.725s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, this is something that we can leave open to debate as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6214.46s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But is it possible for us to have an official meeting where we're not following Robert's rules and therefore making it a very not<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6312.937s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some of the rules are just have a recess and just have a listening session as well, where we're all present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6318.161s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if we do deliberate, if we do make decisions, yes, we would have to reform the committee or after a recess period.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6405.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to suggest that we have a system, a way of thinking about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6412.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If something goes wrong, and it's really bad, all the parents show up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6416.031s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Wouldn't it be great if the system was, let's actually work together on making something right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6420.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A more proactive response in how we plan the policies of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6429.13s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I feel like parents have reached out to all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6432.353s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sure we all have solid problems that people have reached out that we've all done solutions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6486.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Once again, like I said, I don't think that the question is, oh, there's some terrible thing that we're just not doing, per se, like a slide that needs to be prepared.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6498.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think the issue is more inviting people that have a resource available that they might be able to provide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6507.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And by creating a time when they can actually attend,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6510.179s">[Ruggiero]</a>: they can actually begin to engage with the community and try to figure out how they can fit that resource into the needs of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6518.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are you all set?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6776.443s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do an official survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6777.784s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is unscientific.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6778.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We mis-explained it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6783.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, there's always going to be issues on the weekend as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6786.571s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So some parents, they get told that Monday we may not be able to go on Saturday.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6790.655s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I do believe that if we create an event atmosphere, we create like child care or a movie that we project, create something that's more fun as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1057.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just had a quick question about the spent ammunition that you found on the field.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1062.725s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Was the caliber the same caliber or a different caliber of bullet that was from the prior incident?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1074.973s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Was the prior bullet a 9mm?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1077.976s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That was a cartridge.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1078.697s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Much different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=1079.618s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2024.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2025.551s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mrs. Grant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2026.152s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2026.732s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Owens.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2027.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=2028.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2605.463s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2607.084s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It says it's capped at 39, and you have 39 already?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2610.587s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you're all full.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2720.841s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just had a quick question about the statement here required to pass a criminal background check for the tour guide and the tour directors.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2730.675s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know anything about what type or how it's usually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2735.962s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so it's a CORI check usually?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2741.659s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3650.199s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, thank you for putting together this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3652.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had a question about the actual unexpected walk, bike, share table that you have here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3658.541s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how is the expected calculated?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3662.604s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is, it says that we have 47% for other members.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3668.468s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These aren't the numbers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3669.689s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is on the GHG.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3729.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you, when I read this through this report, I was looking for other communities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3735.264s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give us a sense of what a community like Melrose or Somerville or Arlington, what their participation rates would be?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3855.262s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The line that I found most sort of interesting was the sequence that says if you live less than a mile from the school, the actual participation is 8%, but you're expecting about 30%.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3871.628s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you see other communities making that 30%?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3875.249s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what do you think makes Medford unique in this regard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3880.733s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Where are we lacking, I guess, because I would love to see, you know, I think it's a great thing for kids to be able to walk to school or bike to school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3887.419s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how can we make that better?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3895.525s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3973.991s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible you could give us these statistics broken down by school instead of having it through the whole district, as you do here, the actual and expected?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3985.2s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, I'm looking at the greenhouse gas admissions page and how your school compares and has actual and expected walk, bike, chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3993.81s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That sequence right there?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4017.374s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Also, once it's not, if you don't have the 50% participation rate, it doesn't necessarily get recorded.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4025.153s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not as accurate, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4306.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4308.711s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Did you want to speak something?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4310.548s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to, I think this report is great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4314.09s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think there is a huge potential, especially at that under one mile mark, to improve the participation in this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=4321.234s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you so much for bringing all the hard work and bringing this program forward to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=983.948s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But first, suspension of the rules.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=985.39s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know we have a number of big reports coming tonight, and a member of the community would like to speak on an event at the Chevalier Theatre.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=2272.882s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how is this weighted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=3097.715s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I totally understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5907.177s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are there reimbursement for children of special needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5912.158s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is there a financial waiver for students of special needs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5942.75s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the full $10,000 has been- Is the need higher than the number of students that we've provided for or around that figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5975.673s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Did more people apply for the scholarship than received it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5989.227s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5989.927s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Patterson, may I ask you a question about financing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5992.148s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How much would it cost for us to maybe provide a waiver for 15 more students to increase the number to 30?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6000.05s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Another 10,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6001.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would that be the waiver needed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6041.104s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible you could crunch those numbers for us as a report?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6069.526s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's say, for example, we found $10,000 under the rug here at City Hall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6074.399s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and you reapplied that money, would we lose money from the state if we, let's say, provided a scholarship for 30 other students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6084.828s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, I'd like to make a motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6088.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6089.812s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to make a motion for us to ask for a report to see if you could report back to us what that number would be, because if<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6096.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If there is a need greater, I mean, I know many parents that are struggling in the city of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6101.04s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some of the parents work two jobs each.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6103.502s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, this program might be a huge boon for them and their family.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6107.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be interesting for me to know what it would take for us to make 15 more slots available.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6113.928s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If, you know, someone provides all the information.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6127.814s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, and the staff is still the problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6129.655s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, obviously there's hurdles, but I would just like you to look into that for us if possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7085.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: have a little bet going here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7087.078s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you tell us which one of the school committee members she's complained about the most?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7095.34s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it Paul?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7097.401s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7097.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What happened to the coaching school series?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8069.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, thank you very much for bringing forward this information to us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8072.65s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm really excited about this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8074.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I would like to do, if possible, would be nice to actually see some of the kits.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8079.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we could actually bring them in, or we can go to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8081.559s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I need a station wagon to bring that stuff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8117.026s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I'd really like to see is, let's say we're doing crawfish week, I don't know, for example, it'd be great if we could line up field trips and activities that follow along that theme, whether it's go to the aquarium or the crawfish factory, whatever.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8133.53s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be nice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8134.812s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Does the FOSS program go along a calendar?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8136.834s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like in October we do worms or whatever?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=95.844s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=375.732s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible we could also add a plaque?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=377.493s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, oh definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=378.013s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To add some historical context.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1533.328s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, maybe we have to refresh, review the policy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1537.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that's a good idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1538.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But to my knowledge, wasn't it that they have to use the facility on a regular basis or is it just one time like the Kiwanis?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2296.606s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, well, I certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2298.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: think that the mustang blue is a great color choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2300.772s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it might be an interesting idea to allow some of the students to pick out the color.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2305.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible that we, I know time is short, but is it possible that we could open up maybe for like a little informal vote to get the kids a little jazzed about the whole project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=344.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=348.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On page 17 to 43 of the updated document, there's just a question about classification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=354.828s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I notice there's a national grid, but it's listed as unclassified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=357.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was just curious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=364.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's check number 0237291.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=368.102s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know if that helps.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=370.743s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=370.923s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=372.524s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just curious why that wouldn't show up as utilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=382.15s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=382.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's $2,141.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=382.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's about right dead center of the page, 17 of 43.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=403.781s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=405.141s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, it's, I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=425.065s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=426.326s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And another question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=428.288s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's looking at electricity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=429.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then there was one that came up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=431.189s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's on page 7.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=433.89s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's on the updated document, 7 of 43.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=435.73s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=437.631s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Standard Electric.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=438.711s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then it says Educational Supplies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=441.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Standard Electric, a vendor?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=444.433s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=444.813s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, they're a supplied vendor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=446.213s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=446.293s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, so when I was looking at electricity, I was curious about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3786.109s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, this is a question for Cheryl.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3788.09s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just curious, so this bid was submitted to you on the 6th, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3793.555s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I received it today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3795.056s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just curious, like, why didn't they... Well, I do have an answer for that question of why they did not submit the bid.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3966.031s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Did you talk to the lawyer on duty today, or did you talk to the<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3992.447s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This vendor is certified to make a bid on the project.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3996.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But they didn't make a bid on either round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4001.979s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4002.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible we could reopen the bidding process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4138.678s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think everyone here is on the same side.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4140.279s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, we all want to save $100,000 and have a beautiful playground.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4144.36s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My question is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4145.581s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I guess I'm trying to understand why they didn't bid the second round.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4247.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many vendors gave you this ballpark figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4262.658s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know, is there like a warranty process on this company versus the ones we have?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4281.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I guess my feeling is I like the idea that we could save $100,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4287.516s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, my concern is I just want to know, is this being done properly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4293.099s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How much time would it take for us to reopen the bidding process?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4296.524s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we had to put, like, let's assume, assume that we do have to open the re-bidding process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4300.827s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4307.693s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it's like a two-month, and we can't install in December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4860.112s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had a friendly amendment that we have someone, whether it's either Howard or Mark Romley, some legal representation, because it seems like there are legal questions in play here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4869.674s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Definitely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4874.155s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we have a legal representative at this meeting to make sure everything is clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10085.734s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it might be an interesting project for our web coding to put together like a little web store to avoid the problem where we have an overfill issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10094.598s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So parents could order what they need online, and then we could just ensure that they have a pickup spot location.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10102.004s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So like, you know, Bobby's mom bought these supplies online, we'll have a little label printed out, Bobby's mom gets her supplies right at school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=518.77s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On page seven as well, so the Roberts miscellaneous charges, is there a particular set of charges that fall under this or?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=530.333s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's student activity, yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=533.214s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=535.134s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's all I have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2682.23s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2685.058s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Superintendent Nelson, do you have a sense of what the size of the capital budget request would be just ballpark figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2720.152s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would the mayor be able to speak to the size of the capital budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2733.72s">[Ruggiero]</a>: After the last budget meeting, I was deeply disturbed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2738.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Not by so much the presentation of the budget or anything that was contained in, but a fact I learned that I wasn't aware of.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2743.931s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And this would be the pupil transportation of homeless students and the amount of money that's spent to this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2750.856s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, I have no troubles helping students that are homeless, making sure that they're a part of our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2757.841s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But when we spend so much on these students, that money could be better used<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2763.485s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to house them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2766.006s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The fact that we're spending over $13,000 a year to move a child here from Medford to whatever community they come from where their parents might be living in a shelter is insane.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2779.792s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It is the exact kind of bureaucratic insanity which prompted me to run for elected office.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2788.651s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So that said, I would like to ask my colleagues that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Brumley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2794.453s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Now, I understand that the state is supposed to reimburse us for this money, and they haven't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2801.936s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But we have a platform to advocate for these children, and by pressing this case as hard as possible,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2809.65s">[Ruggiero]</a>: with either our own attorney, Howard Greenspan, or City Solicitor Mark Rumley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2814.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think would shed light on this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2817.554s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like I said, it's absolutely absurd that we spend this money to truck a child back and forth, rather than helping them house, helping them find housing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2830.34s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I seriously would like to make a motion that we refer this issue to City Solicitor Mark Rumley.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2841.979s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, we've been doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2873.908s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's my understanding that the Supreme Court ruled that they have to reimburse us for this money.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2878.07s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct or incorrect?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2890.924s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I think that we need to pursue this issue beyond simply just putting pressure on legislators.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2897.485s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2908.888s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the resolution I'd like to put forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2964.762s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, they can put a ruling for... There is a ruling from the Supreme Court.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2973.035s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I would like to make a formal motion to have City Solicitor Mark Rumley and Howard Greenspan look at this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2980.348s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to advise us how we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2983.81s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My frustration is not in helping homeless children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2986.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That absolutely needs to be done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2988.572s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My frustration is wasting money that could be better used housing these children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2992.955s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I find it deeply frustrating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3445.707s">[Ruggiero]</a>: beyond the other points, the kindergarten aides and the capital budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3451.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I am going to end up abstaining on this budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3454.37s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have difficulty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3461.713s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I- And this is not a capital budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3472.677s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand it's not the capital budget, ma'am, but could you please<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3475.585s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm asking just for a rough estimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3483.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On the capital, so you have no idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3632.558s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, with all due respect to the superintendent, whose opinion I do value, my frustration is parents are very concerned and very frustrated about the state of some of our grounds.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3645.761s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I mean, so I guess it boils down to a question of trust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3649.502s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I'm ultimately out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3652.344s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3654.305s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I think that's the best move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3657.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've mentioned all my reservations to you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3659.268s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate some of the items that were brought up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3662.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I still can't understand why we can't hire a couple more part-time kindergarten aides.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3668.294s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't understand the logic of that, but.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3678.861s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, and, you know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3682.927s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is my first year serving.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3685.509s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've noticed other members have maybe more frustrations than I, but I'll cut you some slack, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4048.097s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in mid-August, you mentioned that you would roughly have a timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4053.059s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There'll be a committee of the whole meeting where we discuss the capital improvement plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4057.26s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4058.202s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4193.263s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just also want to thank the members of the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4196.927s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciated not only everyone's heart, but also the opportunity to explore the issues with you, because we all have disagreements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4204.954s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We all have programs that we really love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4208.233s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it was a really wonderful experience for me, and I really appreciated working with you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4212.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just want to, beyond all of the work that our finance department did, and all the work our superintendent, and I'm sure all the work that Dr. Edouard-Vincent put in as well, I just wanted everyone to know, I mean, we worked very long on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4227.403s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it really means a lot to me how hard people work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4229.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4306.826s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4307.266s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4307.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, I also have another point that's not a part of the process, but something I'd like to see in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4314.273s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A number of communities have worked with participatory budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4317.914s">[Ruggiero]</a>: where a certain amount of money is set aside for the community to decide how it's used.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4322.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was thinking that .1% would work out to be about $60,000.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4327.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like in the future to explore this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4332.06s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know exactly when the right time is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4335.182s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We could put this as an agenda item so we could debate it or I'll make a motion right now to explore the idea or put it on the next time we have an agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4347.837s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, I would like to see community budget and the school budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4352.619s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So parents have a little bit more feedback.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4354.519s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, yeah, I think that would help community participation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4356.94s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And in addition, parents sometimes have the best ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4360.462s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've learned a whole lot from the people that have called me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4368.205s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to get a sense of when we'll do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4369.685s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'll ask to put that on the agenda when we have the time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4372.146s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4372.386s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Very good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=63.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm just trying to find the page number here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=67.78s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's from the warrant, 18-0-1-3-8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=70.822s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is the minimum regional high school tuition out of state, out of, sorry, district tuition expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=79.426s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Eight of 11, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=81.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's fourth from the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=84.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=102.722s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's the Minuteman Regional High School and Vocational High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=105.904s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=133.957s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.179s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Plumbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=139.459s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it plumbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.0s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=140.58s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Plumbing still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=156.809s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many kids do we have currently in the program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=170.978s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.06s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=173.72s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=175.381s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=176.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1279.987s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1289.192s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1292.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1297.758s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1302.46s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right now the pH is around six, which is<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1305.685s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's way too high for blueberries, so we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1310.007s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up and I talked to some horticultural friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1317.931s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are all really great plants that they've chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1320.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1325.836s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, it depends if the club would like to plant this September.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1331.039s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's a couple of options that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1332.639s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1335.9s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I already have about 30 plants and containers, and I have all the plastic mulch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1340.541s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur, and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1357.056s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1359.657s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It'll take me probably about a couple of days, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1362.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1365.82s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have to measure it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1366.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1415.674s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1420.022s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1426.725s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My fence has 7,000 volts that run through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1428.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1435.209s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1441.532s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1447.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and then we can shut it off once it's on eight o'clock and deer won't bother you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1463.459s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We could actually choose a lower voltage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1465.499s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1468.84s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1473.041s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's basically like someone, a little bee sting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1477.615s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1481.676s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It doesn't leave any permanent damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1483.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's humane to the animals as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1489.739s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, we'd have to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1491.62s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1495.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or we'll hold off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1496.102s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's fine too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1499.163s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1559.973s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanna make sure it's in the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2086.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to comment how awesome that little bag is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2088.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2093.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's a pretty frightening time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2094.791s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2096.733s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It is a scary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2098.674s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2100.276s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or so I've heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2121.507s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2153.374s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2158.598s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2158.898s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could we ask that as a report from the superintendent that we could ask to see how much a universal 3K program would cost Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2165.383s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2170.026s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3038.306s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3040.435s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, thank you so much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3042.277s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First off, I'm just educational and a huge fan of after-school tutoring programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3047.482s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know for my own students, I feel like, you know, during class, I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes, but when I was one-on-one with them, that's when the learning really happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3057.331s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But to that point, I noticed, you know, in your report, as you mentioned, you know, the ratio of students to teachers, probably not ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3065.934s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3070.398s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or do you think, how many teachers would you want it ideally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3097.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3097.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Please let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3099.126s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3105.59s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, it's good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3106.21s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3109.838s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3121.629s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just ballpark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3144.025s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3148.428s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Has there been any conversation with the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3150.149s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it just that their parents want them to have more math time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3153.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The students are hungry for more math time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3155.572s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3184.46s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3197.525s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because I've seen how effective they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3200.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that's a really good point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3218.035s">[Ruggiero]</a>: a district-wide program if we can, and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3223.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you so much for all this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3224.739s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm really very excited about moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3233.323s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As Member DiVendetto mentioned, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3239.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We had to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3240.007s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think that now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3245.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3793.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3796.73s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3808.992s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3813.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Currently I'm talking with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3815.254s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Carolyn Joy about this idea, maybe we could add this to the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3819.036s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're really wonderful because AMC, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3826.099s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3833.081s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They actually involve a lot of creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3835.242s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3839.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the problems are very engaging to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3841.485s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sometimes it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3848.297s">[Ruggiero]</a>: help out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3855.882s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3860.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, math can be, you know, it's taught and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3867.048s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Math can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3877.539s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Students really should touch that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3879.521s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would just, while I understand the cost, and I certainly appreciate it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3883.98s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sometimes, you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit, while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students, so they can get a taste of what math really feels like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3897.935s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, it's a beautiful subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3899.977s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I hope we can design this program, and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4725.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4726.607s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4727.327s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the Romance languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6250.063s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6325.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To just transfer them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6326.68s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6333.107s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Couldn't we just move him to the other school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6412.961s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6417.833s">[Ruggiero]</a>: of EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6424.298s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the sociodynamics versus the other program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6434.066s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions, but do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6451.77s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you had to just give me a rough estimate, I'd try to put you on the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6978.064s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6986.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6987.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6994.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7004.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7010.283s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that an option that's on our table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7042.995s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7069.183s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Brockton.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7071.219s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7088.035s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7090.527s">[Ruggiero]</a>: like bill for that type of program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7137.676s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So just one last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7140.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7148.148s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we'd have to make sure that, or at least they'd find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8125.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8127.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first is on subsection four, where you talk about provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8132.258s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Before I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8138.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really commend the administration for working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8140.283s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know you guys have been cooking this up since like December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8143.285s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8147.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8178.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8194.83s">[Ruggiero]</a>: All that will be verified and we'll make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8196.97s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8197.35s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8197.87s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Once again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8199.231s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8201.191s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8203.391s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's no disasters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8204.852s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9316.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9318.524s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9322.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9326.033s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than take them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9343.661s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's what it means, one out of every three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9345.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or we take 11% out of the general population and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9354.44s">[Ruggiero]</a>: you know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of wanted to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to handle that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9362.866s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So this is a very frustrating report to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9365.407s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What's most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9376.095s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, then why are you choosing, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9378.296s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9382.065s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then why choose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9383.606s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9392.133s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or there's a reason to choose one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9394.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9405.204s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe we could do a math magnet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9406.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That might be easier to draw our STEM magnet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9409.976s">[Ruggiero]</a>: might be easier to create.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9411.117s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One school has more of a STEM focus, another school has more of a liberal arts focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9415.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are not in front of us anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9473.469s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's our choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9474.97s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's our choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9475.53s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9476.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9480.032s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9485.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We all kind of saw it coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9486.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9489.617s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I would like to suggest is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9491.618s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9497.157s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9510.289s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9520.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9523.202s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's 16 kids there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9524.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, these are people that, friends that want to be together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9528.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9532.524s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9538.825s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right now, there isn't, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9541.105s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're saying they're equal, they're both great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9543.526s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Then it's a false choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9578.21s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I am in strong support of a weighted average option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9581.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That might be another way to play it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9583.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=9588.158s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10039.434s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, is it possible that we could only have a chance of 17 or is the number 20 a hard one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10460.035s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, just two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10460.995s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, first, I just want to address the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10463.736s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, this is not a choice anyone here wants to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10466.378s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Everyone wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, what their kids, but just talking about sort of the choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10473.521s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we're going to have to do a lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10474.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're basically forced into this choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10476.302s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The question is, what is most fair and what is best?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10479.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think we can all kind of agree<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10482.315s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10488.72s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What's best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up, that's the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10495.866s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Have one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10512.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10520.241s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10524.604s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10532.069s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he's working in parallel, I guess is the phrase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10541.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I feel like this is the best way forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10544.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's best for the students, and it's fairest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10576.839s">[Ruggiero]</a>: May I make a friendly amendment to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10580.4s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10618.019s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, let's ask the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10619.26s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have the experts right before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10661.439s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have a parent that would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10664.6s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Your name and address, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11130.675s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11132.575s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11133.536s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11136.756s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's important for the community that for, you know, we don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11144.978s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11149.019s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if we can get, you know, 10 people<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11152.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11156.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I really do support this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11158.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be a certain, there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11637.058s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Overall, I definitely support the spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11638.659s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11641.02s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11645.083s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think it's important for us to recognize as a group<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11648.239s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11653.762s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11657.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11670.371s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it would be nice if we had a number.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11673.066s">[Ruggiero]</a>: or a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make, you know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today, but he had a really great suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11686.671s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Martin lives on this address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11688.132s">[Ruggiero]</a>: He wishes me to bring this point up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11691.093s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11697.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11701.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we can all agree that this is probably for the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11703.853s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11705.874s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't prefer, I don't like it either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11707.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11712.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11712.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11716.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11723.552s">[Ruggiero]</a>: can also have a means of communicating with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11725.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11729.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=63.902s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm just trying to find the page number here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=67.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's from the warrant, 18-0-1-3-8.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=70.805s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is a Minuteman Regional High School tuition out of state, out of, sorry, district tuition expenses.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=79.408s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Eight of 11, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=81.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's fourth from the bottom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=84.39s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to know, what are the two programs that most of the students are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=102.685s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's the Minuteman Regional High School.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=105.087s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, Minuteman.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=105.547s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The out-of-district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=134.065s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know, of this program, what is the one that most of the students are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=139.167s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Plumbing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=139.447s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it plumbing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=140.287s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=140.768s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Plumbing still?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=156.773s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many kids do we have currently in the program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=170.957s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you just give me a breakdown of the program when you have time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=173.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Certainly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=173.678s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give me a breakdown of what programs are enrolled in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=175.358s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely, ma'am.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=176.378s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=187.607s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1279.968s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we had the reddismith and the landscaper and I, we walked the area and sort of viewed and we also did some soil tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1289.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For the high bush blueberries, the soil isn't quite acidic enough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1292.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If possible, I'm happy to donate the plastic mulch, the thyme, and also the sulfur.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1297.717s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if possible, I'd like to start preparing the soil so we can get the pH.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1302.419s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right now the pH is around 6, which is kind of, it's way too high for blueberries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1307.64s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we have to drop that around to about 4.5 or 5.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1309.98s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm happy to donate all the preparations for blueberries, but these other plants that were chosen, I looked them up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1316.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and I talked to some horticultural friends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1317.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are all really great plants that they've chosen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1320.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We just have to touch up a little bit with the blueberries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1325.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, it depends.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1326.93s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If the club would like to plant this September, there's a couple of options that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1332.634s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be best to rototill the area for the blueberries.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1335.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I already have about 30 plants in containers, and I have all the plastic mulch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1340.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I would recommend would be to rototill the area, spread some sulfur,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1346.483s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and then give it a couple of months, and then we can apply some, I have prepared some acidic wood chips, so that'll help as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1357.025s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would prefer to get that done as soon as possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1359.626s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It'll take me probably about a couple of days, I guess.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1362.226s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just need to rototill it, lay down the plastic mulch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1365.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have to measure it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1366.647s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also can, I'll send down all the drip irrigation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1381.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1382.154s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Happy to.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1408.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: close to the school This would be up to the school committee how we handle this problem the way I handle this on my farm is we have an electric fence and<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1420.268s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm happy to, once again, I'll donate the T-poles and the wiring, and I'll set it up for everyone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1426.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My fence has 7,000 volts that run through it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1428.913s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously it won't hurt anyone, but it could be a great prank for kids to mess around with, so we'll have to talk with the community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1435.196s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you want me to install it, we definitely need to shut it down during school hours, and we'll have to talk.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1441.499s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it's possible we could turn it on once school is not in session, and then I could put it on a timer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1447.483s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then we can shut it off once it's around 8 o'clock and deer won't bother you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1460.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We'll talk about that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1463.44s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We could actually choose a lower voltage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1465.482s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a higher voltage on my farm because I want the deers to get shocked.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1468.824s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if we have people around, we can have a lower voltage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1473.027s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's basically like someone, a little bee sting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1477.59s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like someone hits you kind of hard with a pencil eraser is what it feels like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1481.668s">[Ruggiero]</a>: it doesn't leave any permanent damage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1483.349s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's humane to the animals as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1489.714s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, we'd have to figure out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1491.595s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you want, I'll be happy to lay down the fence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1494.997s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or we'll hold off.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1496.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's fine, too.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1499.22s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1559.766s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Kreatz.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1563.428s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Supporting the Tilling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2086.948s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to comment how awesome that little bag is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2088.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for putting that together as a father who's about to have a kid go into kindergarten.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2093.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's a pretty frightening time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2094.914s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that makes a lot of people a little more nervous.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2098.537s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it only gets worse.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2099.418s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2100.259s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or so I've heard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2121.488s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know, have you heard much interest expressed in the community about starting a pre-K program that's also available for everyone?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2153.356s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense of what the cost of that kind of program would be in the community?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2158.559s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2158.879s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could we ask that as a report to the superintendent, that we could ask to see how much a universal pre-K program would cost Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2165.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know there's a cost associated, but it'd be interesting to at least know the figures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2169.984s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3040.554s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3042.255s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First off I'm just educational and a huge fan of after school tutoring programs.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3047.458s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know from my own students I feel like you know during class I could just sort of run them in circles sometimes when I was one on one with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3054.821s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's when the learning really happened.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3057.284s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But to that point, I noticed in your report, as you mentioned, the ratio of students to teachers is probably not ideal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3065.897s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you think that if we added two more teachers to the program, that would have really solved the problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3070.381s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or do you think, how many teachers would you have wanted ideally?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3097.602s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Cool.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3097.962s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Please let me know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3099.203s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if you ever need help in that way, I'm always happy to find one or two days a week to help you out.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3106.19s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I need the teaching hours for my license anyway to keep it good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3109.824s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My second point is, can you just give me a sense of what percentage, I know maybe you don't have the numbers handy right now, but of the 68 students that participated in the program, how many used the bus?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3121.595s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just ballpark.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3144.002s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The next question I have for you is, do you know why all these students were participating?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3148.408s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Has there been any conversation with the parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3150.11s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it just that their parents want them to have more math time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3153.413s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The students are hungry for more math time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3155.556s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it they saw their MCAS scores and it was like, let's just put out fires?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3184.454s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, in the future, I think that these type of, and I would like to sort of make this point to my colleagues as well, I think that for our school district to be one of the best in Massachusetts, this is the type of program we're gonna have to have district-wide, because I've seen how effective they can be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3200.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Now, for me, when I was a teacher, it was math club, but there were some parents, I was like, yeah, it's not, bring them to math club, it's okay, I'll make sure we find some time for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3209.611s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it has a huge impact on students, especially when it's in a small environment, more intimate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3214.744s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'd really like to start thinking about turning this into<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3218.005s">[Ruggiero]</a>: a district-wide program if we can and sort of use Columbus as a pilot, learn what we can from it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3223.188s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you so much for all this hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3224.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm really very excited about moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3232.052s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, as, you know, Member DiVendetto mentioned, you know, unfortunately, this program came about sort of in an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3239.136s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We had to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3239.976s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think that, you know, now that the fire is out, there's a lot that we can learn moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3244.959s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3793.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3793.972s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3797.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's really important that we design this program to touch both students that are struggling and students that are excelling.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3808.975s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I found personally, there's a really great program called the AMC8s.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3813.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Currently I'm talking with Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3815.219s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Carolyn Joy about this idea of maybe we could add this to the curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3819.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're really wonderful because AM, the American Math Competition, and they're designed for eighth graders.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3826.065s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When I taught them to seventh and eighth graders, the problems themselves aren't just like, you know, where's the formula, chunk the formula, and you're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3833.069s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They actually involve a lot of creativity.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3835.21s">[Ruggiero]</a>: and they feel a lot more like undergraduate mathematics, as it should be.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3839.532s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the problems are very engaging to students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3841.473s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sometimes it could just be the type of thing where you print out a big packet of problems to students, hand them to them,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3848.28s">[Ruggiero]</a>: help out the kids that are, you know, struggling a bit, and then check in with your students that are really accelerating.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3855.845s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that, I mean, from my own educational experience, I really saw a huge impact, because, you know, math can be, you know, it's taught, and this isn't anyone's fault, obviously, but when you're teaching to a test,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3867.032s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Math can seem soulless, but the AMC 8s, you really feel the creativity and the beauty of mathematics, which is something we really should have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3876.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Students really should touch that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3879.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would just, while I understand the cost and I certainly appreciate it,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3883.963s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sometimes, you know, kids that are accelerating really can kind of cruise a little bit while teachers help the ones that are struggling, give some challenging, more advanced problems to those students so they can get a taste of what math really feels like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3897.906s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, it's a beautiful subject.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3899.947s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I hope we can design this program and I hope we can pilot this program for the whole district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4725.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I had a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4726.809s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4727.289s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you know if there's interest in the student body in other languages, other than the romance languages?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6250.049s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So of this A team and B team, it's not simply that we can put the B team at the Andrews and the A teams at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6325.186s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To just transfer them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6326.648s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like once they're, let's say they get to, you have a newcomer student, he's a really quick learner, he moves up to level four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6333.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Couldn't we just move him to the other school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6409.348s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can I follow up, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6412.51s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6412.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I guess my concern would be when you have a large concentration of EL students at one school, then you also have EL parents also at that same school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6424.279s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It creates an environment where you might have one program just happens to be wealthier because of the socio dynamics versus the other program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6434.046s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I think that we have to recognize as a board that there aren't necessarily perfect solutions<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6440.092s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But do we have a sense of how many students are in the A team versus the B team?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6451.758s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you had to like just give me a rough estimate, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6978.046s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just one of the options that have been floated with some of the parents that have talked to me about this issue is this idea of creating a language magnet school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6986.475s">[Ruggiero]</a>: at the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6987.796s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be the reason why people want to go there is that they actually maybe has a full bilingual option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6994.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So every kid that goes through the McGlynn gets both, I don't know, whichever of the EL students that you have the most of, and that language.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7004.585s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you give me, I mean, I know that I'm asking you to do a lot of ballparking, but is such a program possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7010.268s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that an option that's on our table?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7042.978s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are there any other magnet schools in the area that do either Haitian Creole or Portuguese?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7071.182s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if we did a bilingual Portuguese magnet school, we'd be the only one in the state that has that program, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7084.875s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know of no Haitian Creole... Could you give us a sense of what it would take to actually architect<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7090.513s">[Ruggiero]</a>: like bill for that type of program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7137.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So just one last point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7140.24s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if we did a bilingual Haitian Creole program, every teacher that's in there now, we'd have to find a new home for them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7148.111s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we'd have to make sure that, or at least they find a way to get certified in Haitian Creole.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8125.338s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, just two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8127.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first is on subsection four, where you talk of provisions for quality control.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8132.241s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Before I, I just, I really do support the idea of doing partnership programs with local universities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8137.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really commend the administration for working on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8140.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know you guys have been cooking this up since like December.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8143.249s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But could you just outline what are the provisions for quality control?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8147.332s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because we're allowing them to hire the contractors, how do we really know that they won't shaft us?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8178.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And sort of just to branch off Paul's concern, which is my concern as well, I just want to understand, so prevailing wages, how do we know that let's say they find some company, they say, oh, they're prevailing wages, don't worry about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8194.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: All that will be verified and we'll make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8196.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8197.345s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8197.865s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Once again, I just really appreciate all the work you're doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8199.386s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no, it's good that you're asking because I want you to understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8201.187s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8203.189s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's no disasters.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8204.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9316.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9318.486s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I know the administration is working very hard to deal with this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9322.068s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I hate to funnel Cassandra, but this is a very frustrating report to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9326.032s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we all kind of hoped it would go away, but here we are now at the last minute with no options of really solving it other than<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9334.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: take them all from Brooks, which means that 33% of one out of every three kids that applied to go to the Andrews might get sent to the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9343.637s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's what it means, one out of every three.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9345.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or we take 11% out of the general population, and we say to the 16 kids that go to McGlynn Elementary that they're just, you know, even though that they want to go to Andrews, you know, they went to the McGlynn, they kind of want to do something new, you know, we're saying you also have to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9362.304s">[Ruggiero]</a>: to handle that, so this is a very frustrating report to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9365.366s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What's most frustrating about this whole point is sort of this false choice that's being laid out in front of us that, oh, you can choose, but they're equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9376.275s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Then why are you choosing?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9378.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If these schools are equivalent, they're truly equivalent, then why choose?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9383.6s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, we have more room for ELL students at one school, I understand that, but it's just everyone's randomly drawn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9391.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, or there's a reason to choose one school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9394.0s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, maybe having, I love the idea of having a Haitian Creole magnet school in Medford, make us unique in Massachusetts, but that's a huge investment of time and energy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9405.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe we could do a math magnet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9406.865s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That might be easier to draw our STEM magnet.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9409.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Might be easier to create one school has more of a STEM focus, and the school has more of a liberal arts focus.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9415.568s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are choices that we could have made, and now here we are at the 11th hour, and those choices are,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9421.471s">[Ruggiero]</a>: not in front of us anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9473.453s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's our choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9474.934s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's our choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9475.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9476.034s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm not trying to take someone to the woodshed here, and that's not my intent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9479.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think what's frustrating to me about this report is I think it was kind of obvious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9485.279s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We all kind of saw it coming.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9486.28s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We just hoped it wouldn't be here at the 11th hour.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9489.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What I would like to suggest is this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9491.602s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, no matter what we decide, it's going to cause a little bit of trouble.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9497.125s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it seems like if we expect that every school sort of has a reasonable distribution, it seems only fair to me that the Brooks School would be, you know, we say 17 or 20 kids have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9510.271s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that just, you know, maybe that seems, you know, when we think of like what is fair for the community, is it fair for the entire community to say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9520.428s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, you know, you're at the McGlynn Elementary.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9523.19s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's 16 kids there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9524.911s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, these are people that, friends that want to be together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9528.394s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They also should share, even though their school doesn't have this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9532.497s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in the future, I would really like to start considering more seriously the idea that there is a choice to be made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9538.822s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right now, there isn't, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9541.083s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're saying they're equal, they're both great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9543.525s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Then it's a false choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9545.186s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's have a reason for kids to go to one school versus the other.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9578.176s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I am in strong support of a weighted average option.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9581.939s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That might be another way to play it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9583.88s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that it seems only fair that we expect every school to basically feed into one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=9588.143s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And unfortunately, that means one school will have more of a percentage of kids broken up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10460.019s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, just two points.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10460.98s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, first, I just want to address the community at large.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10463.722s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, this is not a choice anyone here wants to make.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10466.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Everyone wants everyone to get what they want or, you know, with their kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10471.056s">[Ruggiero]</a>: just talking about sort of the choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10473.477s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we're going to have to do a lottery.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10474.758s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're basically forced into this choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10476.258s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The question is, what is most fair and what is best?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10479.459s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think we can all kind of agree that what's most fair is sending kids from the school that is only sending 9% of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10488.703s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What's best also, though, if we're trying to prevent friends from being broken up,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10494.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's the best way to do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10495.838s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Have one school that's not sending their kids actually make, because the probability, if you have three buddies, of two of them getting selected, so at least you have Tom, you might not have Bob, but at least you have Tom with you, is much, much better.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10512.29s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if we have a system where 11% of every school is dropped off, we're going to be breaking up friendships, and the likelihood is they're not going to have cohorts with them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10524.573s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that we're looking at, we're surveying what's not only best and fairest, but what is best for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10532.037s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I really do believe that this plan of Paul's, which is something we're kind of cooking up with two minds while he worked in parallel, I guess is the phrase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10541.123s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I feel like this is the best way forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10544.104s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's best for the students and it's fairest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10576.523s">[Ruggiero]</a>: May I make a friendly amendment to that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10580.405s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible, seeing that we only need 17 students, would be acceptable?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10618.0s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, let's ask the administration.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10619.241s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have the experts right before us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10660.664s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have a parent that would like to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10665.068s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Your name and address, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10669.452s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Hi, I'm Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11130.387s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely, yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11131.308s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11132.569s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11132.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11133.509s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One last point in support of this idea of Mr. Tucci going down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11136.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's important for the community that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11141.262s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We don't want kids to just be forced at the last minute with no recall.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11144.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We want parents to have as many options as they can and many possibilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11148.946s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if we can get 10 people to move over, that's only five that we have to select from the rest of the cohort.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11155.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I really do support this idea.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11158.051s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think either we're paying now or we're paying later, because there's going to be feelings about this, especially when we're taking such a large percentage.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11637.041s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Overall, I definitely support the spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11638.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I leave my cell phone in the car for this very reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11641.003s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, I have my computer here, but I'm not receiving texts to it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11645.066s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I think it's important for us to recognize as a group<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11648.225s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that we live in an age where people that do have serious disabilities can still participate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11653.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it would be great if we create an environment for that to happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11657.468s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I agree that we should have all of our personal, like, you know, someone shouldn't be sending member Ruggiero a message or member Paul a message, because that's kind of, it's kind of working beyond the spirit of open meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11670.331s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it would be nice if we had a number or a Twitter feed or something where maybe the chair could make,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11677.844s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know, Martin, who has a serious disability, wasn't able to come today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11683.93s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, but he had a really great suggestion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11686.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Martin lives on this address.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11688.114s">[Ruggiero]</a>: He wishes me to bring this point up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11691.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really would feel, I think, you know, we live in a time where we can make that possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11697.003s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to suggest, once again, a friendly amendment that we, for now,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11701.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think we can all agree that this is probably for the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11703.836s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I leave my cell phone because I get texts during meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11705.857s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't prefer, I don't like it either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11707.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I get the same kind of, and I don't want to, you know, I don't think it's fair for me to like, hey Mia, do you really want to do this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11712.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11712.861s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's, that's also seems to be subverting the spirit.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11716.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But on the same token, I think it's important for us to pursue avenues that people that do have serious issues that they can't come to meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11723.535s">[Ruggiero]</a>: can also have a means of communicating with us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11725.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I'd like to look that we think about ways to make that possible in the future, if I can make a friendly amendment for us to sort of figure out the wording together now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4610.266s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Chief Sacco, can I ask you a question, please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4618.548s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So reading through the report, I can understand some of the teachers' frustrations.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4622.909s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure this is absolutely clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4626.791s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you or any of your officers believe that Superintendent Belson floated a conspiracy theory that perhaps there was some sort of setup?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4638.461s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure absolutely clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4640.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think the answer is obvious, but I want to make sure from your mouth.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4644.286s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So none of your officers feel like there was any sort of a sense of Roy Belson trying to say there was some cabal to take down the principal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4652.192s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4701.392s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4701.752s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make, from my opinion, from talking, I've had the opportunity, the blessing of talking to a number of the teachers, and I've also talked to a number of the parents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4712.527s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've heard so many wonderful things about how hardworking<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4716.848s">[Ruggiero]</a>: almost with, I can't even think of an exception, all of the McGlynn teachers I've talked with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4723.312s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to express my sincere gratitude for all the hard work you do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4729.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As a former teacher myself, I was never a successful middle school teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4734.559s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I find middle school teaching the most difficult of all teaching.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4738.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so I have a deep, deep appreciation for all the hard work you do, and I thank you very much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4745.866s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I hope that it's pretty clear that this is maybe a misreading or misunderstanding of what the report was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4753.35s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do not believe that Roy Bellson ever tried to throw the teachers under the bus as if any of you would ever lay bullets in an auditorium in a safe space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4763.835s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just can't imagine any of you doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4765.496s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you, and I'm sorry about this miscommunication.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5904.357s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How the issue was brought up, it was, I was under the impression that we were going to discuss the transition strategy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5913.819s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is the notice that was made.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5916.56s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I didn't, it would have probably been more helpful to the community and to me as a member if the discussion was about continuing Roy Belson's contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5927.735s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because I wasn't, personally, I wasn't really prepared to have all the reasons and to rehash through the argument other than what I did.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5937.63s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I share your concerns.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5939.668s">[Ruggiero]</a>: because I do believe that it was an important decision to make and I think more community input would have been very helpful, as I made clear during the meeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5968.154s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, but it doesn't say that Roy, just a clarification, it does not say that in addition, Roy Bellson's contract may be extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5976.562s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The idea of the, while what we, I do not claim that what we did was a violation of open meeting law, I don't think so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5982.768s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It wasn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=5983.148s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it would have been more clear to the community if that issue of Roy Bellson's extended contract was made more apparent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6037.199s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To add on to that point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6039.066s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To add on to that point, I mean, I would like to suggest that these important decisions are made during regular committee meetings.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6046.811s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand that sometimes we do need to go into executive session or committee of the wholes, but that particular issue should have been televised so the whole community could hear it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6058.679s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's unfortunate that the community had to sort of hear about it secondhand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6064.383s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It creates an environment of mistrust.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7352.819s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to address a couple of the other points that we've sort of moved past, including the public records requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7358.928s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's important that the public as being a public body, we are under all the laws that govern public requests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7367.98s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we have a subcommittee of community relations, but I think this issue is sort of, I would like to have all the members present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7374.225s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'd like to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting where we can address, go through all of the items that are important, including maybe having a mic stand in the back corner.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7384.393s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, you know, if there is a disabled person, we could just hand them the mic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7388.632s">[Ruggiero]</a>: or talking about public requests, where all these issues can be addressed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7392.394s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'd like, like I said, to make a motion that we have a committee of the whole meeting to address all community engagements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7413.647s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7413.947s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I've made public requests and people have been very helpful, but it's unacceptable that emails bounce.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7419.632s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But beyond that, there are other issues that we need to discuss about community engagement, community relation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7424.956s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to do that as a body.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7426.457s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So that'd be my motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7453.133s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, we can work with the chair and just sort of add items on the agenda that would be, like we normally would when we have a meeting request.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7461.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But basically the broad outline would be<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7464.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: how to discuss increasing community engagement on the school committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9354.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just want to make this clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9355.136s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right now, we have a disparity of 29 children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9357.838s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if 29 of the 100.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9360.1s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, 29 of the 176 went to the McGlynn, it would be equal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9363.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9365.384s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's my math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9367.105s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we were.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9371.809s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9372.169s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, I'll believe you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9373.19s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm just trying to, once again, trying to get the 15 to 20.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9377.874s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So if we're in a buffer of 15, that would work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9382.614s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So one school has... Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9399.466s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we need to convince 14 students, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9404.184s">[Ruggiero]</a>: 14 on the, that would be the most, if we can convince 14 students, are there any incentives that we can offer other than low class size that we can offer to those 14 students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9413.869s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like is it possible we could identify the cohorts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9416.991s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So these are 10 kids that just definitely want to be together, they're buddies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9421.214s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so we're gonna make sure that they go over and we can get to our 14.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9543.909s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My question, so I just want to know when is the deadline we have to decide exactly on the lottery?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11113.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to remind the body that soccer is the leading cause of concussion among women and girls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11118.25s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's also in the top two or three among boys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11121.392s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's a serious concussion risk in soccer.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11124.954s">[Ruggiero]</a>: People don't think it's a contact sport, but it really is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11127.476s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's often caused, I mean, my wife sees it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13009.36s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you once again for your service.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13011.901s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just had a quick question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13013.182s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we participate in the American Math Competition, the AMC 8s, AMC 10s, AMC 12s?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13042.93s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, the AMCAs are just tests.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13062.424s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we do that in the middle school, the eighth grade AMCs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14571.36s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14572.48s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for putting this together.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14574.641s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On page one of 13, this is of the financial year budget expenditure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14579.683s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you just explain what errors and omissions, what that line item is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14587.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see, I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14587.805s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, thank you just for clarifying that for my brain.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14590.206s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm a little sleepy right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14592.027s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And also, on page two of 13, I had a question about the photocopy lease and purchase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14615.944s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Those are my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2082.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Good evening, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2085.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2125.803s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2127.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2136.071s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2151.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Despite spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2165.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2349.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2358.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2364.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thankfully, I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2370.786s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2479.994s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2483.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2499.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2504.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2516.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5151.646s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5152.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some operational questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5156.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5164.076s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5425.945s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5426.925s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5435.933s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that's not doing very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5437.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They fail a large number of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5440.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5535.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5541.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5549.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6808.777s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6810.84s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6817.308s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6925.27s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mentioning accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6932.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6936.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you look over teacher performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6939.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7049.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.437s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.837s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10161.388s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10356.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Also, I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10368.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11029.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Follow up, Mr. Oshiro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11031.002s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You used the phrase robust curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11033.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you explain what that means exactly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1040.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Dr. Stray, as I was reviewing your resume, your special education work really stood out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1046.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to describe the most difficult dilemma you faced when you were managing the special education department in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1053.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And as you address that challenge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1055.291s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like you to focus on three specific areas for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1057.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, what made your decision challenging?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1061.375s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Second, what interests were pitted against each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1065.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And third, ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of your decision to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1089.352s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of this decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2575.882s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Strait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2576.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really enjoyed the conversation, talking about community engagement and successful budgeting, which involves a lot of what I was going to ask you next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2590.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no, they're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.271s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.891s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2592.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Speak as long as you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2594.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm really interested in this conversation about strategic planning and turning that into budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2600.735s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to talk specifically, if you could, about how you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2609.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So your team has come together, they've put together a strategic plan and a draft budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2613.879s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you receive their input and how do you change the numbers based on that input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2619.321s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2623.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for maintaining that budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2628.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, plans don't always work the way you think they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2632.151s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how do you identify when things begin to go wrong in the budget and then address that problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2835.911s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources in the community would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2897.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, what indicators do you look for to notice points where your plan is beginning to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2904.952s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how do you adjust them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4322.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm a certified teacher myself, and one of the things that I think about a lot is this idea of risk in education and trying experimental new ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4332.658s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On one hand, you want to try the most innovative approaches, but on the other hand, when you deviate from a known path, in some respects, you're risking educational time that will be lost on the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4344.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm interested in knowing about is tell us about the most innovative educational practice you've tried, something that was experimental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4355.336s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would like to know about some of the resistance you received from the community and how you went along implementing that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4952.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to ask also about discipline, because I don't think we've asked a lot of those questions so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4957.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to give you a hypothetical situation, and I'd like to hear how you could address it for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4963.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4965.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like you to imagine a student who has filmed a teacher without the teacher's consent or knowledge and puts an inappropriate but not terrible voiceover over this YouTube video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4983.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So something that isn't inflammatory but something that is not really appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4988.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you address that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4992.751s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's assume this student has some discipline issues in the past, but nothing serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4998.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Similar sorts of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7488.402s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, first off, I just wanted to know, is the live stream okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7493.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so that's being addressed okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7498.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So here's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7500.651s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Over the past few days, I've been looking through my emails in preparation for these interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7505.852s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What has surprised me is how some very intelligent, passionate, and engaged parents of our community have lost faith in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7513.774s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some have urged me not to consider any candidate from within our system, even as one as qualified as you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7519.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To these residents, how would you rebuild their faith?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7523.856s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In your experience, how is trust built?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7526.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How is it damaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7527.94s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what actions can we take to ensure greater community participation at all levels of the Medford school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7649.728s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you work to, for some, I've talked to a number of parents and especially the ones in high school actually do have a very high opinion of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7658.26s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to make sure I make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7660.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But that said, I mean, among the other parents, how would we reach out to them to create a higher trust environment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7748.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9121.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As all cities in Massachusetts, severe poverty touches the lives of some of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9127.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What types of challenges do you think that these children endure and how would you help them succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9220.121s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you like to share a particular experience that you've had in particular dealing with a student that had severe poverty and how you helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10650.754s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to talk to you about budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10653.036s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So community engagement is critical to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10656.418s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That said, how would you construct your first draft of next year's school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10661.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10666.465s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10670.688s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for the budget itself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10803.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you engage with the community to do presentations for the budget and how would you receive their input as you move along?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10860.851s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, and finally, how would you notice if there was a problem with the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10865.42s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it is, like you said, a fluid document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10867.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what indicators would you look for when things start to go wrong, and how would you adjust it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=770.005s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you're asking for a committee of the whole specifically to handle, for these questions to be addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=823.472s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just another question of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=826.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How long would it take you to answer some of these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=828.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just worried that we're going to go a little too fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=831.604s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I'm inclined to second your motion so we can debate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=835.428s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I'm just, I wonder, how long would it take you to get this payroll information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=855.559s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could I make a friendly amendment to your resolution before, could we make it in two weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=859.701s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One week seems a little quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=863.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The chair will call it at a reasonable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=891.941s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1072.129s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1073.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just have some questions for you cause you know, I'm concerned if there are issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1078.293s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's okay if we, if this is not the appropriate time for these questions, I just trying to get my head around all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1084.456s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1085.979s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If the administration raises a base salary that's not a step increase, the school committee is notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1092.304s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1094.946s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the base can go up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1097.769s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're not notified of those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1181.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you send us copies before the meeting of the digital, I have the digital teacher's contract, but it would be nice to have the other collective bargaining contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1192.044s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you could send that to all of us, that would be useful so I could review the information in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1198.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so every contract has different rules for step increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1202.95s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.171s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.631s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, so I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1221.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1223.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so you can have multiple step increases at once or would it just be one step at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1230.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like every year you would get no more than one step increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1246.051s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, that's all my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1247.072s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2453.611s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2459.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: 44,954 children's and young adult books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2461.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A mountain of material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2463.433s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But only one small part of what our library provides to the children of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2468.274s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Beyond these books, or CDs, or DVDs, or curriculum support,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2473.676s">[Ruggiero]</a>: hundreds of story time hours and tutoring sessions, the most important parts of our city library are the safe halls sheltering the students of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2485.284s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have all seen the pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2487.846s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We need a library without a leaking roof or rotting floors or flickering lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2493.59s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it is for this reason that I ask you to request that the city council approve the construction of a new space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2502.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A place where children can not only study for the MCAS, but also a space where WIM can take a child to the dialogues of Plato or the history of DNA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2512.642s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2513.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's build a new dry home for the greatest minds and a place for children to wander amongst them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2521.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A few members wish to speak on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2523.986s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to invite them to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2527.507s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if anyone has any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3720.761s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible that we could have an official appreciation certification that we could do through the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5207.018s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5208.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5209.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I wanted to know, and maybe Member Mustone explained this, but I just wanted to know would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5217.419s">[Ruggiero]</a>: parents be able to also get an introductory meeting like what Alice is and why it's important and why we're choosing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5223.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5226.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible I'd like to make a motion that we pursue a community event because a number of parents have been asking me this very question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5233.146s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we can actually have a full forum on what Alice is, why we're moving toward it, and why we think it's important for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5240.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can someone second that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5576.788s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just have a question about professional development days in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5580.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you would, usually the different topics be scheduled in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5585.371s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was just because of the current situation that we decided to move this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5588.412s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5589.052s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5590.464s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in terms of the ALICE program, I just wanted to know a little bit about how the decision was made to move forward with ALICE versus like these other programs that we're mentioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5603.131s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, that was part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5619.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we know that the Medford PD fully approves this program the most?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.825s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That helps me understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5643.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to clarify from my mindset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5647.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6400.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6401.108s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6402.969s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a question for you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6404.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do you, if there is someone in the community that has the ability, like a retired individual, would it be possible that they could help tutor kids in these AP classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6414.311s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've had a couple, when I was knocking on doors, reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6416.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They were retired professors of physics that might be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6420.693s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or if you had someone in the community that was able to help out with tutoring, would you guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6495.407s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could I ask the deputy superintendent to look into how we could create such a program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6526.746s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps we could look at something doing in collaboration with the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12676.828s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12678.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first is so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013 and I was wondering what accounts for that drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12690.034s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12693.476s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have children completing a survey<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12697.45s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey and profit with this information will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12707.592s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12709.373s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12712.613s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12755.276s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, what was the drop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12757.937s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The drop was pretty significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12759.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12826.22s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5087.874s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5091.556s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5093.298s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first is, so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5101.224s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I was wondering what accounts for that drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5104.766s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5108.209s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have children completing a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5112.18s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey with this information it will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5122.329s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5124.11s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5127.353s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5170.003s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, what was the drop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5172.665s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The drop was pretty significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5174.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5240.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?<br><br>
