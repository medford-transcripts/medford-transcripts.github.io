    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1040.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Dr. Stray, as I was reviewing your resume, your special education work really stood out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1046.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to describe the most difficult dilemma you faced when you were managing the special education department in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1053.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And as you address that challenge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1055.291s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like you to focus on three specific areas for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1057.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, what made your decision challenging?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1061.375s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Second, what interests were pitted against each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1065.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And third, ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of your decision to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1089.352s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of this decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2575.882s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Strait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2576.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really enjoyed the conversation, talking about community engagement and successful budgeting, which involves a lot of what I was going to ask you next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2590.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no, they're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.271s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.891s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2592.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Speak as long as you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2594.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm really interested in this conversation about strategic planning and turning that into budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2600.735s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to talk specifically, if you could, about how you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2609.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So your team has come together, they've put together a strategic plan and a draft budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2613.879s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you receive their input and how do you change the numbers based on that input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2619.321s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2623.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for maintaining that budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2628.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, plans don't always work the way you think they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2632.151s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how do you identify when things begin to go wrong in the budget and then address that problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2835.911s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources in the community would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2897.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, what indicators do you look for to notice points where your plan is beginning to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2904.952s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how do you adjust them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4322.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm a certified teacher myself, and one of the things that I think about a lot is this idea of risk in education and trying experimental new ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4332.658s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On one hand, you want to try the most innovative approaches, but on the other hand, when you deviate from a known path, in some respects, you're risking educational time that will be lost on the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4344.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm interested in knowing about is tell us about the most innovative educational practice you've tried, something that was experimental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4355.336s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would like to know about some of the resistance you received from the community and how you went along implementing that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4952.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to ask also about discipline, because I don't think we've asked a lot of those questions so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4957.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to give you a hypothetical situation, and I'd like to hear how you could address it for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4963.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4965.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like you to imagine a student who has filmed a teacher without the teacher's consent or knowledge and puts an inappropriate but not terrible voiceover over this YouTube video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4983.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So something that isn't inflammatory but something that is not really appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4988.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you address that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4992.751s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's assume this student has some discipline issues in the past, but nothing serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4998.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Similar sorts of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7488.402s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, first off, I just wanted to know, is the live stream okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7493.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so that's being addressed okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7498.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So here's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7500.651s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Over the past few days, I've been looking through my emails in preparation for these interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7505.852s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What has surprised me is how some very intelligent, passionate, and engaged parents of our community have lost faith in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7513.774s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some have urged me not to consider any candidate from within our system, even as one as qualified as you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7519.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To these residents, how would you rebuild their faith?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7523.856s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In your experience, how is trust built?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7526.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How is it damaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7527.94s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what actions can we take to ensure greater community participation at all levels of the Medford school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7649.728s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you work to, for some, I've talked to a number of parents and especially the ones in high school actually do have a very high opinion of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7658.26s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to make sure I make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7660.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But that said, I mean, among the other parents, how would we reach out to them to create a higher trust environment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7748.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9121.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As all cities in Massachusetts, severe poverty touches the lives of some of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9127.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What types of challenges do you think that these children endure and how would you help them succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9220.121s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you like to share a particular experience that you've had in particular dealing with a student that had severe poverty and how you helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10650.754s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to talk to you about budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10653.036s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So community engagement is critical to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10656.418s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That said, how would you construct your first draft of next year's school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10661.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10666.465s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10670.688s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for the budget itself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10803.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you engage with the community to do presentations for the budget and how would you receive their input as you move along?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10860.851s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, and finally, how would you notice if there was a problem with the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10865.42s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it is, like you said, a fluid document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10867.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what indicators would you look for when things start to go wrong, and how would you adjust it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2082.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Good evening, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2085.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2125.803s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2127.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2136.071s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2151.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Despite spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2165.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2349.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2358.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2364.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thankfully, I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2370.786s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2479.994s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2483.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2499.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2504.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2516.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5151.646s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5152.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some operational questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5156.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5164.076s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5425.945s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5426.925s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5435.933s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that's not doing very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5437.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They fail a large number of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5440.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5535.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5541.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5549.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6808.777s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6810.84s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6817.308s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6925.27s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mentioning accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6932.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6936.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you look over teacher performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6939.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7049.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.437s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.837s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10161.388s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10356.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Also, I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10368.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11029.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Follow up, Mr. Oshiro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11031.002s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You used the phrase robust curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11033.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you explain what that means exactly?<br><br>
