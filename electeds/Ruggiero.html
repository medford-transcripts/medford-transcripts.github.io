    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1326.667s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1330.37s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So going through the list of resignations here, I noticed that our nutritionist retired.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1335.974s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So who's current, do we have any backup nutritionist, or is Rhetta the only one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1345.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So are we anticipating on hiring someone new?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1348.805s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if so, when are we going to post the position?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1371.906s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, my concern is that not having a nutritionist on staff for the entire district I think is not a great idea as we're piloting a new program like you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1382.934s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I seriously would like to suggest that we start looking to fill that position as soon as possible or find some sort of solution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1390.64s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Secondly, just I suppose a little greedy for me, I mean, who's gonna be taking care of the blueberries in the middle of the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1397.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know what's going on with the outdoor,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1407.77s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So right now we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1411.912s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1412.292s">[Ruggiero]</a>: She was just taking it on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1413.533s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know she did a lot of work, including making hummus for the kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1417.414s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This is concerning to me, especially with some other information that we have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1424.978s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I just would like to be updated when we find out more about it and when we're going to be filling out the role.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.055s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4477.835s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And thank you very much for all the hard work on this issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4480.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know this is not just important to me, but our entire community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4484.778s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I do have a couple of questions really quick about the initial observations of the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4490.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So September 16th, you said, that we did the initial map testing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4494.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4496.224s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So can you give us a sense of, it was the REI score, was that one?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4502.347s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it RET?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4503.328s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.009s">[Ruggiero]</a>: R-I-T.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4506.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So on that score, is dyslexia viewed as sort of a place on the spectrum?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4514.072s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is dyslexia, how is dyslexia exactly tested?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4518.034s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because that's sort of an either or type of prognostic measure versus sort of like a value on a bell curve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4574.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what we're looking at here is sort of a battery of different skills, and so if a kid sort of, for lack of a better word, bombs a bunch of regions or domains on those skills, then they're forwarded to someone, or how would that work?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4679.498s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess my concern with the issue, and I have no doubt on the abilities of the staff to handle these issues, but being able to address dyslexia is a serious concern that people devote an entire medical career to, basically.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4694.135s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have someone who knows how to handle these kids versus sort of a generalist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4698.92s">[Ruggiero]</a>: you know, environment that you would have from the teachers address these issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4702.784s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, I mean, there's certainly a difference between reading difficulty and dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4707.669s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I guess that's what I'm trying to suss out here on these metrics you're bringing ahead.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4714.736s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like, if you see, like, five red flags,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4717.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you say, OK, so we'll give this kid a couple of months to try to, we'll really focus, we'll bring in some coaches or whatever it takes to get this kid moving, or do we start moving that information ahead with the parents, say, look, this child might need help outside of school in addition to the work that we're doing inside of school, and we've got to figure out a partnership.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4739.176s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do you understand the question I'm trying to say?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4823.69s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think it's important that we recognize this as a committee, that we're not screening for dyslexia, we're screening for reading ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4831.395s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so the question I have would be, let's say, for example, you give a student this test and they don't do very well for whatever reason.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4841.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So intervention is applied.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4843.464s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When is the next test happen?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4906.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Does that help?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4907.876s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I certainly do not doubt the ability and the hard work of our teachers, but I think the reason why we're having this conversation now is the recognition that some kids slip through the cracks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4918.823s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean that some children who had dyslexia weren't identified in maybe the quickest way possible.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4926.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or maybe we could do a better job of identifying earlier to make sure that these kids.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4930.631s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm trying to get a hold of is what is the educational roadmap.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4936.234s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I understand a kid, let's say a kid doesn't do great in fall, he doesn't do great in winter.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4942.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's say he doesn't do great in spring either.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4944.96s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When do we begin to start huddling up and say,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4948.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: well, maybe this child is dyslexic and that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4951.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it's not, it's just a different way of thinking.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4954.323s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's so we need to address something outside of school or some other technique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=4959.145s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5054.61s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, and I completely understand what you're saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5056.872s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So my son is sick, for example, let's say he has a cough.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5059.614s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We take him to the doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5061.095s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The doctor runs a battery of screens and maybe prescribes him an antibiotic.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5066.059s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if he's still sick in a number of other weeks, then we do other things.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5069.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no doubt what you're all trying to do.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5072.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess one of the things that's not clear to me is the course by which it goes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5077.969s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I understand it's certainly<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5079.83s">[Ruggiero]</a>: somewhat you play it by the kid, so each kid's a little different.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5083.372s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5084.513s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But it's important for me to understand that after, let's say, eight or nine months of intervention, we're not going anywhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5090.476s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There's sort of a stopgap or a necessitated next move that we have to make sure, because I mean... So we don't let it go that long.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5099.081s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sure you wouldn't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5124.555s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess so as I'm talking to different people, there is the perception or belief or parents have this experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5132.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I'm trying to make sure that we don't have the experience where someone had to pay for their own assessment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5138.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They told the kids just a little has a little trouble with reading or will never be a novelist or something.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5144.244s">[Ruggiero]</a>: These are words the parents will tell me that was was told to their child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5147.765s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They paid for an intervention, and now they're actually working with an outside consultant to make sure that that child has the help they need, and they're catching it in the sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5156.673s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have no doubt.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5157.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I'm a teacher myself.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5159.095s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I understand when you have a classroom of students, sometimes maybe their dyslexic kids can often be very bright and very good at hiding and shielding their certain inabilities.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5173.088s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I guess I just want to make sure when I talk to this parent, I can say to them, well, these things won't happen anymore.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5179.334s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have a new screening program and we have a new roadmap to making sure that kids get the process and the help that they need.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5187.082s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Does that make sense?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5195.47s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5196.091s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5197.232s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I want to make sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5198.954s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, Madam Superintendent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5436.72s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think it's important to recognize I'm not other members that would like to ask.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5441.123s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well let me ask a few more questions member.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5444.165s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to get a sense of the early assessments that have been taken.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5447.366s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean can you give us a sense of what percentage of children have been identified with needs or certain deficits and reading skills.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5472.495s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so yeah, it would be really great to hear an update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5475.278s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for all the hard work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5477.66s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really do appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5478.701s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think it's great that we're doing the screening now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5481.023s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6140.968s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6143.594s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to follow up on Paul's point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6146.757s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is data collected about our students unbeknownst to them or is there any personalized information that Lexia will then harvest on our students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6156.768s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I assume they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6157.649s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I hope they won't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6164.376s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6165.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of, I just wanted to get one second because as we were talking about this letter that goes out to all parents, are the different areas of testing necessarily aligned between the maps and Lexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6177.098s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I imagine like phonemes are in there somewhere and sentence comprehension is in there somewhere.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6182.762s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So there's<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6183.903s">[Ruggiero]</a>: broad areas that could be used when you send this report to parents and saying, we're concerned about sentence comprehension, but we're on it and we're focused on these particular materials.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6193.471s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could something like that be done?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6773.17s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6776.772s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We get the RFP in hand?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6848.135s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I would much rather have another committee meeting than before approving a $1.3 million contract.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6854.499s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just voicing my opposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=428.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=429.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Joseph.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=430.547s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let me shake your hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=454.397s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=455.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to say that when I originally saw the images online and I read about them in ScienceDaily.com when I first saw them, I was just blown away by the images.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=465.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it's just really exciting for me to know that our hometown made a little contribution to that moving forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=471.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd just like to know, Joseph, can I ask you a couple of questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=473.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=474.346s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I'd just love to know, what in particular was your contribution to the project?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=533.601s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=536.343s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=537.603s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=538.684s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you just help us understand why this is so special and why it's so difficult for, why this discovery hasn't been made before?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=583.88s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And can you tell us the location, how many light years away it is?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.04s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's absolutely amazing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=612.761s">[Ruggiero]</a>: For someone who's not prepared to speak, you certainly do know the topic very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=616.864s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's very clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=617.824s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like, I'm sure this invitation is already being extended.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=620.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The discovery was extraordinarily, I mean, was inspirational to me, and I'm sure a number of our other students would love to see your work and see some pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=628.092s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I imagine a number of science students were very excited about black holes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=632.916s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've never actually seen them, because my son's first word was actually black hole, because I subjected him to all the videos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=640.221s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that there are a lot of students that would be really inspired by what you've done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=643.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for what.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=644.406s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=645.187s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you all.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2057.984s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2058.964s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2059.665s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a couple of questions about excused absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2063.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's assume for a moment we had a child with extraordinary abilities, perhaps they were like a chess master at a very young age, and they had a tournament to attend and it conflicted with school hours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2074.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would that student be able to receive an excused absence to attend a tournament?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2090.188s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I assume the administration wouldn't penalize a child.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2146.423s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2148.664s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm slightly disappointed by the stance our schools took for a couple of reasons.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2154.047s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I certainly understand member Van der Kloot's thought that we need to review the policy and change the policy and perhaps the direction that we should move forward.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2164.312s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The whole point of this walkout is to draw attention to the fact that adults aren't solving this problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2171.756s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the fact of the matter is that by not sort of excusing these absences, we're actually providing almost proof to that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2183.042s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Look, it's more important for you to go<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2185.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: practice with your color than deal with the fact that the oceans might rise by a couple of feet in a couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2192.29s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is, I think, ultimately what disappoints me the most about the school's proposition.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2198.256s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, to sort of echo what member Ruseau mentioned, we would not excuse students to attend a hate rally.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.306s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2206.746s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that's, that, no, it's not the question, just like a child who is a chess prodigy, we'd all get together and say, you know, this kid's doing well in school, we'll make sure they make up their material, or a child that's going to Spain, perhaps, we'll make sure that they make up their material, they won't miss any schoolwork, and we'll give them excused absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2225.342s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That position could have been taken here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2228.504s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I guess that's what I find<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2231.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There is wiggle, I mean, once again, we don't have the policy at hand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2235.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But we as a community, as a country and a world, have to recognize that there are things that are more important than words written on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2244.169s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And we need to, if we have the capacity to, just like I'm sure in Boston, they don't have a only climate activism is excused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2253.773s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And just sort of one last point in this regard.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2257.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I also think it's a little,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2259.898s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't necessarily know whether teachers should be there.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2263.222s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean part of the idea of this walkout is for students to express their anger and frustration about what we as adults are doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2272.313s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You know and we all share responsibility in what's happening in our world right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2277.5s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think that these are important things to keep in mind.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2279.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In terms of the excused absence, I think we can call it what we like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2286.4s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We should not penalize these students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2287.86s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We should excuse these absences.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2290.441s">[Ruggiero]</a>: People should not be made to feel like, oh, I have to choose between my world or a bunch of kids I play football with that I really love.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2297.362s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's not a fair choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2648.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I support where member Van der Kloot is going with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2651.928s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to offer a friendly suggestion or two amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2654.97s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to excuse the 1% of students right now that did not attend school on that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2662.612s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The 1% that you said there was a dip.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2665.494s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like to excuse all students that did not attend school that day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2669.946s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think that makes more sense than, if we're going to start actually beginning to take action on what's happening on climate, I think then we have to recognize in talking about policy, about which students need to be excused when, I don't necessarily think that, that addresses the issue to the spirit of what the students are trying to protest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2690.616s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would like to stand behind them in any way possible, and this is the way I think we can do it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2799.346s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We don't have the policy in front of us to tweak it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2801.908s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We need language to tweak it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2819.243s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And that is the action that we critique.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2821.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're talking about 1% of students, if there were some students that were sick that day, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, okay, we'll count them among them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2829.368s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We'll count them among the excused.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2830.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think there's going to be some sort of huge consequence to this behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2834.551s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I don't think that we're setting some sort of awful precedent that if people want to go to Charlottesville and hit someone else in the car that we're somehow supporting them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2842.134s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I think this, with all due respect to the committee, and with all due respect, I think it sends more of a message to our support of the students, that if we vote now and excuse all the students that weren't able to, that have unexcused absences on the book, now we can do that as a committee, rather than send it to a subcommittee where we talk about it and it comes again in like four weeks.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2890.191s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2996.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I suppose that this is my reservation in all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3002.944s">[Ruggiero]</a>: While I deeply understand students, they wanted to go, they were worried that they would get an unexcused absence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3008.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And now we're going to retcon it in retroactive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3019.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe that's something that will actually, they'll remember that they had a moment when they could have gone.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3027.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They could have standed out for the climate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3031.017s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But they were worried about some sort of consequence or inconvenience or problem.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3035.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And maybe next time they are more willing to actually stand up for the environment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3042.05s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Maybe next time they're more willing to move forward with this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3048.377s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I think I'll let it pass for now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3635.302s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3636.863s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just would like to ask that when the plan is proposed, we have options.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3642.648s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's not like this is what we think is the best.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3645.791s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I thought that the process that we went through for the superintendent search was excellent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3651.436s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to make sure that it doesn't go to a subcommittee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3654.238s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You guys present us a book, and we vote on it, and we're done.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3657.24s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's something I thoroughly hope that we can all be involved in, because these are serious decisions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3662.542s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I commend member Rousseau for doing research on this regard, because that's useful for me to know as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3668.924s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to maybe suggest that we add a mandate to this subcommittee, that they provide us with maybe three different plans, or... Just for general information, a feasibility study would have to happen at some point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4717.903s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4718.424s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Khan, for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4720.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to ask some questions about illustrative math.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4722.486s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4723.206s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I think this is how it works.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4726.568s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So when kids complete online exercises, all that information is recorded for you to look over.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4731.39s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4734.251s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, when the online classes, that information isn't compiled globally for you?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4755.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, the exercises themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4756.932s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4757.372s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're not using those.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4758.113s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, exercises themselves are on paper.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4760.174s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That was my misunderstanding.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.195s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4761.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4762.475s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have a sense of, I remember that printouts and kids carrying binders were a key element of this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.36s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4769.88s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of how our compliance percentage is going?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4773.543s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know it's early in the year, but I remember as a math teacher, I would have a certain percentage of kids and I'd open up their bag and all the papers would come<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.185s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4815.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you give us a sense of how things are working so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4818.126s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Obviously, I know it's very early in the year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4878.14s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Personally, I think it's very exciting that we're trying a new program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4880.32s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just very nervous about the implementation and I just want to make sure I have a couple questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4884.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So help me understand a little bit about the pedagogy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.242s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4887.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So here we have there is a page that gives I imagine there's like a page that hits all of the modalities that they're doing sort of a guide for the lesson and then the teachers choose from like a potpourri of exercises that they feel would best fit their students that basically how these classes work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4948.237s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do we have a sense of how the teachers, so far, so good?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4953.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that what we're hearing so far?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4979.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is there like a test that students are going to be administering?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4982.446s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or is it sort of like all the teachers have a lot?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.569s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=4986.929s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's the PD day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5016.848s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much for these reports.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5018.309s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate as much information about this particular program, because I'm very excited about it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5024.173s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6107.87s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, one last question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6108.992s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I forgot to ask you this, but it's on my list.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6112.055s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know what percentage of the two class books that are being taken out for children that don't have access to computers at home?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6121.247s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we know how many of those books are being checked out?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6162.497s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I mean, I imagine just sort of with the demographics, I'm sure there's some classes that it's a much higher population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6168.881s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, are there lots of teachers saying, Faiz, I need books like now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6173.344s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Are a lot of teachers bugging you about that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6221.859s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I look forward to the update.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6222.759s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6699.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you for the report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6700.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: This was, I'm speaking for myself, but I think for the other members as well, this was very important that we work on this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6708.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I had the element of the dyscalculia, I'm mispronouncing it, of course, I'm sorry, elements of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6716.282s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do any of these screenings actually address those concerns as well, or dysgraphia is the other issue, or these are all directly, we're mostly concerned with dyslexia in these initial incidents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.01s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6734.991s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And in terms of the workshops being very competitive.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6739.615s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the idea here is that the teacher is going to attend the PD and then they're going to come and share the ideas that they learned from these workshops to all the other teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6781.716s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6782.636s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It seems like a strange process.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6784.097s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, the teachers you would expect to have the professional development would be the ones that are struggling the most to address the problem in the population.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6792.702s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And while I think it's great that three teachers were selected to learn this program, I mean,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=6799.105s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It'd be great if we could have all the teachers attend.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1167.341s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We do have that if there is like a stated emergency that would require that that the chair refuses to recognize point of clarification But but you're not saying an item not on the agenda can be discussed<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1178.206s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, in terms of an emergency situation, so we do have the authority via open meeting laws to discuss those issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1185.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If the chair refuses to put that emergency item on the agenda, we can force that issue to be recognized under open meeting law as long as there's a super majority and we wouldn't violate any open meeting clause if it's an emergency situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1219.652s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A supermajority would have to agree that it is an emergency.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2204.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Two questions as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2205.338s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2206.278s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first question I have was your mix of the opt-in versus the opt-out model that you have.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2212.461s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the original screening, students are just going to have the survey if they want to fill it out or not.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2217.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that an option?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2218.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if they get included in the study, it requires both consent of the student and the parent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2223.467s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that still the model that we're using?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2225.429s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Great.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2226.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the second question I had is, you mentioned before that it would be possible to include other questions, a couple of other questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2234.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It would be great if we could have a question also on vaping and a question on maybe activity levels, including like diabetes and like sugary drink consumption.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2262.0s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, it would be nice if we could have a question about sugary drink consumption as well, because that is a really rising health cost, as you noted.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2284.122s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I don't know if this requires an amendment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2286.703s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I also don't want to jeopardize the scientific value by including every single question under the sun.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2291.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But if it doesn't actually jeopardize the scientific value of your study, I would prefer questions about obesity and sugary drink consumption and activity levels to also be included<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2302.077s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps Ms.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.487s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2316.927s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's the most important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2317.687s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I understand.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2318.448s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't want you to jeopardize the scientific value of what you're doing by expanding out the scope.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2349.662s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I don't think this requires an amendment, but if you could look into that for us, I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2361.201s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Well, I would imagine, I mean, I'm speculating, I don't have the scientific data in front of me, but I would imagine that children that tend to be less active and also have a poorer dietary environment<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2373.596s">[Ruggiero]</a>: also have a higher likelihood to use marijuana.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2376.318s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know if I have any evidence of that, but it would seem at least sort of, you know, you imagine sort of the person smoking pot, watching TV, eating Doritos.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2385.326s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, that could be a cliche, or perhaps there's some scientific truth to that fact.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2388.849s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't know.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2416.789s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, the reason why I mention it is I've had a couple of parents now talk to me about, you know, their child was involved in middle school sports and they were very athletic and then the vaping and the drug use came into their lives and all of that stopped.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2431.118s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, I mean, I would be curious to see whether that correlation actually is valid or if it's just sort of like word on the street what I hear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2439.509s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2528.074s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Free breakfast, lunch feasibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3291.527s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So thank you very much for rushing out this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3294.228s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know that we all asked you to expedite it and with all the other budgetary work that you had.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3299.951s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really appreciate it because as I mentioned before as a former educator, I know what it's like when kids show up hungry and I've seen the effects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3307.834s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've taught at both kinds of schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3309.795s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I do share Member Ruseau's reservations about not doing an after the bell program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3316.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When kids have the opportunity, if mom and dad are running late, that kid doesn't eat.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3321.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And one of the issues that we talked about at the superintendent review was making sure we have a consistent program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3328.292s">[Ruggiero]</a>: throughout the entire system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3330.295s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I guess the way I feel about it is that, you know, if you're a child in poverty, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Columbus or the McGlynn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3336.662s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just want to make sure that kid's fed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3338.544s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to suggest under this pilot, since we're running a pilot, I would like to have a consistent after the bail program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3346.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That would be what we test, not sort of we try this, we try this, we try this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3350.694s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I want to see what happens when the entire district has an after the bell program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3355.137s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if we have something like 90% participation, then we would know that we have an issue.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3361.286s">[Ruggiero]</a>: seeking a second on that or has anyone else had a motion?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3455.581s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I believe, and I understand, it's like one more thing that member Ruggiero has thrown at the principals.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3462.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But on this particular issue, I do believe it has a significant impact on educational standards.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3468.531s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it will be seen throughout the entire school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3471.013s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would, if none of my, no one wishes to second this motion, that's fine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3474.816s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I would like to make a motion that we do a universal after the bell program for breakfast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3481.341s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That's the one we pilot.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3482.382s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if it doesn't work,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=3483.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we can't get it to work by November, then we can regroup and say, you know, it just didn't happen at the McGlynn because of rodents.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2234.005s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2235.486s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, the story that you just shared with us, can you come back to the podium please?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2239.868s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm sorry.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2243.03s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Your story that you shared with us is not, I mean I've talked to other parents that have had similar experiences as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2248.993s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to recommend that we, oh I'm sorry, excuse me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2253.68s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The experience that you shared with us is a story I've heard before, especially with dyslexic children.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2260.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And to this end, in regards to what you've brought up, I would like to, at least maybe not tonight, if we can't get it on the agenda, but maybe we can do it another night where we can ask for a report for dyslexia, like a dyslexia audit from the school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2274.775s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would something like that be possible, Superintendent?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2325.721s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My concern would be just making sure that we're doing the best for curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2328.923s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I appreciate the presentation that we're going to have tonight, but it would be useful for me to understand where we are as a community versus just research.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3896.18s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3897.201s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3898.481s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, doctor, for this very informative presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3900.821s">[Ruggiero]</a>: There are a number of things that you brought up that really interested me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3904.985s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One of the things I guess that concerns me, so we can expect, according to your research, we can expect 10% of the students in our school system at all grade levels are suffering from dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3917.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Of that 10%, how many, I wasn't sure if I caught it in your presentation, if I missed it, I apologize, but what percentage of students that are in that 10% category are actually aware of their dyslexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3936.845s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would they be medically diagnosed with... No.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3951.995s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, let me clarify my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3953.597s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So of the 10% that have dyslexia,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3957.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How many have a medical, what percentage of that 10% have a medical diagnosis of dyslexia?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3993.484s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that I would like your advice on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=3995.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So for the students that are in the sixth grade, the seventh grade, they've moved beyond their optimal time for treatment, and they're sort of, they went through the wait to fail model, I guess, and they're in the fifth grade, sixth grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4008.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What steps should we take to address those students?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4059.026s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You mentioned the tablet program that you're developing right now on an iPad.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4064.349s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What sort of training is necessary for teachers to quickly and adequately spot dyslexia early on so they can get the best treatment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4108.722s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How long does this little iPad quiz take or game?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4144.981s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So it would be something that we could maybe Xerox off and just let the kids play with for 20 minutes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.441s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4194.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4661.244s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4662.645s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, just a follow-up question on the item.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4665.627s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If we could just sort of work towards having an audit of where we are with the various dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4672.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Our next presentation is going to address many of these questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5998.654s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5999.976s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So currently at the Roberts, can you tell me how many students have IEPs based on dyslexia right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6013.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And is this for all the elementary schools?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6019.083s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you have a ballpark figure?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6028.163s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So let's add that to the report as well, please.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6056.897s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, yeah, I understand that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6058.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, it just seems back of the envelope, right?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6060.799s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we have around 2,000 kids in our elementary school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6064.28s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we know, at least based on the research, what we've heard, that's about 200 kids that are suffering with it right now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6071.644s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So, I mean, the question is, I would like to know, how many of those kids have educational plans in place right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6079.307s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I don't think that this... For dyslexia.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=6085.748s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, that's right, because that's what we're, the idea here is trying to address this issue, just making sure that we know where we're at, because I'm getting a sense that maybe we don't.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8704.656s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Motion to enter Executive Session to deal with the legal matters?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8708.897s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We still have some items left on the agenda.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2082.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Good evening, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2085.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2125.803s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2127.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2136.071s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2151.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Despite spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2165.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2349.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2358.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2364.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thankfully, I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2370.786s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2479.994s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2483.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2499.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2504.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2516.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5151.646s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5152.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some operational questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5156.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5164.076s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5425.945s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5426.925s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5435.933s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that's not doing very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5437.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They fail a large number of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5440.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5535.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5541.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5549.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6808.777s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6810.84s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6817.308s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6925.27s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mentioning accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6932.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6936.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you look over teacher performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6939.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7049.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.437s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.837s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10161.388s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10356.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Also, I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10368.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11029.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Follow up, Mr. Oshiro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11031.002s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You used the phrase robust curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11033.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you explain what that means exactly?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1040.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Dr. Stray, as I was reviewing your resume, your special education work really stood out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1046.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to describe the most difficult dilemma you faced when you were managing the special education department in Andover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1053.389s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And as you address that challenge,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1055.291s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like you to focus on three specific areas for me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1057.953s">[Ruggiero]</a>: First, what made your decision challenging?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1061.375s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Second, what interests were pitted against each other?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1065.518s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And third, ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of your decision to move forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=1089.352s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And ultimately, how did you mitigate some of the negative consequences of this decision?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2575.882s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Dr. Strait.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2576.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I really enjoyed the conversation, talking about community engagement and successful budgeting, which involves a lot of what I was going to ask you next.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2590.31s">[Ruggiero]</a>: No, no, they're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.271s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I apologize.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2591.891s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They're perfect.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2592.771s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Speak as long as you like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2594.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm really interested in this conversation about strategic planning and turning that into budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2600.735s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to talk specifically, if you could, about how you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2609.198s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So your team has come together, they've put together a strategic plan and a draft budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2613.879s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you receive their input and how do you change the numbers based on that input?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2619.321s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2623.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for maintaining that budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2628.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because, you know, plans don't always work the way you think they will.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2632.151s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So how do you identify when things begin to go wrong in the budget and then address that problem?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2835.911s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources in the community would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2897.491s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, what indicators do you look for to notice points where your plan is beginning to fail?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=2904.952s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how do you adjust them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4322.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'm a certified teacher myself, and one of the things that I think about a lot is this idea of risk in education and trying experimental new ideas.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4332.658s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On one hand, you want to try the most innovative approaches, but on the other hand, when you deviate from a known path, in some respects, you're risking educational time that will be lost on the student.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4344.409s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what I'm interested in knowing about is tell us about the most innovative educational practice you've tried, something that was experimental.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4355.336s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I would like to know about some of the resistance you received from the community and how you went along implementing that plan.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4952.832s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted to ask also about discipline, because I don't think we've asked a lot of those questions so far.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4957.216s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I want to give you a hypothetical situation, and I'd like to hear how you could address it for us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4963.021s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4965.245s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like you to imagine a student who has filmed a teacher without the teacher's consent or knowledge and puts an inappropriate but not terrible voiceover over this YouTube video.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4983.8s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So something that isn't inflammatory but something that is not really appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4988.783s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you address that situation?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4992.751s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's assume this student has some discipline issues in the past, but nothing serious.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=4998.015s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Similar sorts of problems.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7488.402s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mayor Burke, first off, I just wanted to know, is the live stream okay?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7493.905s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, so that's being addressed okay.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7498.067s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So here's my question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7500.651s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Over the past few days, I've been looking through my emails in preparation for these interviews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7505.852s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What has surprised me is how some very intelligent, passionate, and engaged parents of our community have lost faith in our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7513.774s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Some have urged me not to consider any candidate from within our system, even as one as qualified as you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7519.695s">[Ruggiero]</a>: To these residents, how would you rebuild their faith?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7523.856s">[Ruggiero]</a>: In your experience, how is trust built?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7526.479s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How is it damaged?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7527.94s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And what actions can we take to ensure greater community participation at all levels of the Medford school system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7649.728s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you work to, for some, I've talked to a number of parents and especially the ones in high school actually do have a very high opinion of you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7658.26s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I just want to make sure I make that clear.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7660.723s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But that said, I mean, among the other parents, how would we reach out to them to create a higher trust environment?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=7748.442s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9121.883s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As all cities in Massachusetts, severe poverty touches the lives of some of our students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9127.787s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What types of challenges do you think that these children endure and how would you help them succeed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=9220.121s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you like to share a particular experience that you've had in particular dealing with a student that had severe poverty and how you helped them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10650.754s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to talk to you about budgeting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10653.036s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So community engagement is critical to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10656.418s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That said, how would you construct your first draft of next year's school budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10661.782s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you involve the residents of Medford in subsequent drafts?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10666.465s">[Ruggiero]</a>: What resources would you develop to augment limited funds?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10670.688s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And how would you hold your administration responsible for the budget itself?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10803.561s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Would you engage with the community to do presentations for the budget and how would you receive their input as you move along?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10860.851s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, and finally, how would you notice if there was a problem with the budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10865.42s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Because it is, like you said, a fluid document.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/O8bUu4AaRl4&t=10867.625s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So what indicators would you look for when things start to go wrong, and how would you adjust it?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=770.005s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you're asking for a committee of the whole specifically to handle, for these questions to be addressed?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=823.472s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Just another question of clarification.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=826.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How long would it take you to answer some of these questions?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=828.54s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'm just worried that we're going to go a little too fast.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=831.604s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I mean, I'm inclined to second your motion so we can debate it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=835.428s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But I'm just, I wonder, how long would it take you to get this payroll information?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=855.559s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could I make a friendly amendment to your resolution before, could we make it in two weeks?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=859.701s">[Ruggiero]</a>: One week seems a little quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=863.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The chair will call it at a reasonable time.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=891.941s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I'll second the motion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1072.129s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1073.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just have some questions for you cause you know, I'm concerned if there are issues.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1078.293s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It's okay if we, if this is not the appropriate time for these questions, I just trying to get my head around all of this.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1084.456s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1085.979s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If the administration raises a base salary that's not a step increase, the school committee is notified.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1092.304s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1094.946s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So the base can go up or down.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1097.769s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We're not notified of those?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1181.878s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could you send us copies before the meeting of the digital, I have the digital teacher's contract, but it would be nice to have the other collective bargaining contracts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1192.044s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you could send that to all of us, that would be useful so I could review the information in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1198.747s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so every contract has different rules for step increases.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1202.95s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.171s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1204.631s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, so I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1221.922s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Right, of course.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1223.363s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And so you can have multiple step increases at once or would it just be one step at a time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1230.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Like every year you would get no more than one step increase?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1246.051s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Okay, that's all my questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1247.072s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2453.611s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mr. Ruggiero.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2459.712s">[Ruggiero]</a>: 44,954 children's and young adult books.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2461.653s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A mountain of material.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2463.433s">[Ruggiero]</a>: But only one small part of what our library provides to the children of Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2468.274s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Beyond these books, or CDs, or DVDs, or curriculum support,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2473.676s">[Ruggiero]</a>: hundreds of story time hours and tutoring sessions, the most important parts of our city library are the safe halls sheltering the students of our schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2485.284s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We have all seen the pictures.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2487.846s">[Ruggiero]</a>: We need a library without a leaking roof or rotting floors or flickering lights.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2493.59s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And it is for this reason that I ask you to request that the city council approve the construction of a new space.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2502.319s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A place where children can not only study for the MCAS, but also a space where WIM can take a child to the dialogues of Plato or the history of DNA.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2512.642s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2513.663s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Let's build a new dry home for the greatest minds and a place for children to wander amongst them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2521.385s">[Ruggiero]</a>: A few members wish to speak on this resolution.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2523.986s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I'd like to invite them to speak.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2527.507s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And if anyone has any questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3720.761s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible that we could have an official appreciation certification that we could do through the school committee?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5207.018s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Mayor Burke.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5208.038s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just have one question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5209.478s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I wanted to know, and maybe Member Mustone explained this, but I just wanted to know would<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5217.419s">[Ruggiero]</a>: parents be able to also get an introductory meeting like what Alice is and why it's important and why we're choosing this?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5223.422s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That is a good question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5226.763s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is it possible I'd like to make a motion that we pursue a community event because a number of parents have been asking me this very question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5233.146s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we can actually have a full forum on what Alice is, why we're moving toward it, and why we think it's important for the city.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5240.949s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can someone second that?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5576.788s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, I just have a question about professional development days in general.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5580.749s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you would, usually the different topics be scheduled in advance.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5585.371s">[Ruggiero]</a>: It was just because of the current situation that we decided to move this up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5588.412s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5589.052s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5590.464s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So in terms of the ALICE program, I just wanted to know a little bit about how the decision was made to move forward with ALICE versus like these other programs that we're mentioning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5603.131s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, that was part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5619.943s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So we know that the Medford PD fully approves this program the most?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.325s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.445s">[Ruggiero]</a>: OK, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5624.825s">[Ruggiero]</a>: That helps me understand the situation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5626.166s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5643.996s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I just wanted to clarify from my mindset.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5647.138s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6400.128s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yes, thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6401.108s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you very much for this report.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6402.969s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have a question for you guys.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6404.549s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do you, if there is someone in the community that has the ability, like a retired individual, would it be possible that they could help tutor kids in these AP classes?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6414.311s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I've had a couple, when I was knocking on doors, reach out to me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6416.692s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They were retired professors of physics that might be interested.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6420.693s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Or if you had someone in the community that was able to help out with tutoring, would you guys?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6495.407s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Could I ask the deputy superintendent to look into how we could create such a program?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=6526.746s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Perhaps we could look at something doing in collaboration with the library.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5087.874s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, through the chair.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5091.556s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5093.298s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The first is, so the alcohol use from the 6th to 8th grade dropped pretty precipitously from 2011 to 2013.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5101.224s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And I was wondering what accounts for that drop.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5104.766s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And the second thing I had is maybe just helping us understand the analytics.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5108.209s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So you have children completing a survey.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5112.18s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey with this information it will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5122.329s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have like a sense of like heroin use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5124.11s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I know overdose is a serious issue in Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5127.353s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So do we have a sense of underage heroin overdoses in Medford right now?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5170.003s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Oh, what was the drop?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5172.665s">[Ruggiero]</a>: The drop was pretty significant.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5174.106s">[Ruggiero]</a>: If you have 10%, that's a significant selection.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=5240.918s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And do you have a sense of how many kids are using but don't report on the survey?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12676.828s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have two questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/81TW9SO-xRE&t=12697.45s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Do we have any sense of how many people are actually users but are concerned that if they fill out this survey and profit with this information will be seen by a teacher that they're handing it in?<br><br>
