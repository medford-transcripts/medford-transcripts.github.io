    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2082.724s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Good evening, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2085.567s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2125.803s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I see.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2127.164s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2136.071s">[Ruggiero]</a>: When you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2151.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Despite spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2165.579s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2349.178s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Yeah, when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2358.622s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2364.842s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thankfully, I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2370.786s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2479.994s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2483.915s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2499.599s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2504.218s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=2516.608s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5151.646s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, Doctor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5152.267s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some operational questions for you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5156.85s">[Ruggiero]</a>: So first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5164.076s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5425.945s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5426.925s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5435.933s">[Ruggiero]</a>: that's not doing very well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5437.514s">[Ruggiero]</a>: They fail a large number of their students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5440.016s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5535.506s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5541.79s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=5549.012s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6808.777s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you, good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6810.84s">[Ruggiero]</a>: On your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6817.308s">[Ruggiero]</a>: With some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6925.27s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Mentioning accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6932.99s">[Ruggiero]</a>: As you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6936.871s">[Ruggiero]</a>: How do you look over teacher performance?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=6939.351s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Sure.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=7049.591s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.437s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10156.837s">[Ruggiero]</a>: I have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10161.388s">[Ruggiero]</a>: My first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10356.708s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Also, I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=10368.355s">[Ruggiero]</a>: And tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11029.38s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Follow up, Mr. Oshiro?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11031.002s">[Ruggiero]</a>: You used the phrase robust curriculum.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=11033.966s">[Ruggiero]</a>: Can you explain what that means exactly?<br><br>
