    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2410.574s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you so much for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2412.916s">[Olapade]</a>: I have a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2415.139s">[Olapade]</a>: So on the first slide about the 251 students that were recommended compared to the 201 that actually attended, was the reduction from the recommendation to the actual because of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2425.981s">[Olapade]</a>: parental decisions or was it a?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2465.216s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2466.137s">[Olapade]</a>: And then for the dates and times slide with the six week, four week and various programs, is there a set duration for each program or is it the same for all of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2475.502s">[Olapade]</a>: And then it just depended on the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2500.6s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2501.141s">[Olapade]</a>: And then...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2502.062s">[Olapade]</a>: for each student that gets directed towards one program or another, is that based off both the recommendation of the department plus the conjunction with their parental or their custodian, like whoever's working with them day to day in their classroom and their parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2551.059s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3240.905s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3241.665s">[Olapade]</a>: A question about the students that are entered into this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3244.026s">[Olapade]</a>: Is there a process in which we work with them going to the next school year about how to either be more consistent with attendance or about how to kind of work with your teachers after school about making sure that they're not in danger of falling behind their credits just so that understandably that these students were struggling to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3260.051s">[Olapade]</a>: Are there ways for us to kind of continue to support them going forward that they may not have had previously?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3318.198s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4924.631s">[Olapade]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4928.318s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4929.038s">[Olapade]</a>: For the high school enrollment data, is it possible for us, it doesn't have to be, obviously, right this moment, but could we have the Medford High block separate to the Medford High plus the vocational program, just so that we understand how those numbers are changing for the current time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4943.302s">[Olapade]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=273.139s">[Olapade]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=367.364s">[Olapade]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=418.76s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=422.323s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1713.102s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm like Larry, I can offer to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1715.824s">[Olapade]</a>: I have no experience in this particular, but I'm happy to learn if people feel like I would be an addition, I'm happy to be involved, but I do not have any experience directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1727.153s">[Olapade]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9522.134s">[Olapade]</a>: uh so thank you mayor and thank you for doing this i have two questions you mentioned briefly that for other grade levels i'm assuming this is just for seniors not for juniors and below okay but juniors and below can have a spot and do we have what we need spots wise or is this a lottery system to determine who gets a spot i've been told that we have the amount of spots okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9595.677s">[Olapade]</a>: And then my second question is, is that when it comes to cleanup costs at the end of the year, what does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11394.254s">[Olapade]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2762.142s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2762.543s">[Olapade]</a>: Um, so a question for both the DEP team or the assistant superintendent comments about flushing protocol I understand that every three years with the LCR rule suggests that that's been like the EPA suggesting every three year for testing but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2777.182s">[Olapade]</a>: If we go above the 15 parts per billion, it changes to a different protocol timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2783.51s">[Olapade]</a>: What does flushing actually mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2785.232s">[Olapade]</a>: Like, I keep hearing it, but I want to understand better, like, what that protocol actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2788.136s">[Olapade]</a>: What's the methodology that we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2789.778s">[Olapade]</a>: Why is it that we do that compared to some other method of cleaning up the system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2793.863s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2889.273s">[Olapade]</a>: So it's not a flushing of the entire water system, it's just specific portions of the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2894.535s">[Olapade]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2896.423s">[Olapade]</a>: And then I guess I actually want to agree with my fellow committee member I think that there should be some explanation about how the actual costs, how we're incurring those costs of the, the yearly or try yearly testing just because I think that there's a way for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2911.938s">[Olapade]</a>: afforded if depending what the cost would be to having a more more consistent process just because evidently even though we these buildings were built post the 84 rule about changing the piping that's still an issue evidently so I think there is a way for us to kind of have a conversation about testing more consistently I would like to know how to do that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2931.802s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5015.785s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, I can say really quickly, so I know where we have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5018.126s">[Olapade]</a>: I can say just from a younger perspective, I think needs increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5021.388s">[Olapade]</a>: We understand that as we kind of continue to develop as a city, we're noticing as the school side that the needs of students are increasing individually, as a family, as a school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5030.473s">[Olapade]</a>: Every single person is needing more to be assisted to meet their needs of education success, educational equity, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5036.896s">[Olapade]</a>: So I think it's really important to understand that the needs of the city 40 years ago, the needs of the city 20 years ago, or even five years ago, pre-COVID, are comparably different than they are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5047.04s">[Olapade]</a>: And so I think that though I understand that there seems to be this understanding of how money is so drastically different than it once was, we have to understand that at least on the school side of things, the needs are so severely different now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5057.343s">[Olapade]</a>: And that's why there isn't a new need financially, a new shift of how we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5062.385s">[Olapade]</a>: I think that as someone who was recently both in university and in the school system here, I can tell you that it is incredibly important that even our school spaces are incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5071.231s">[Olapade]</a>: I think there is a population that feels though that as long as you're being taught by someone who really does care about the students and you're a student who really cares about the material, the school space and the environment you're learning in isn't nearly as important as those two core components.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5085.259s">[Olapade]</a>: but we are, we do understand through statistics and through studies that the school space, the learning space is just as important as a teacher who's partly committed to the work and a student who wants to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5095.443s">[Olapade]</a>: So we have to understand that these needs are shifting, and I want us to understand that that's what's happening, that's why the money's changing, I think, as much as it has been in the past couple of years.<br><br>
