    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=387.72s">[Olapade]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=389.14s">[Olapade]</a>: Present.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10677.324s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10677.744s">[Olapade]</a>: I think I just want to echo what our student representatives are saying.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10682.387s">[Olapade]</a>: And I think what we're hearing from the community and email and other communications and just passing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10688.823s">[Olapade]</a>: I said something about this in the previous meeting where how do we weigh the costs of education to student preferences student interests and how we support our students in every aspect of their experience in the classroom and outside the classroom.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10701.79s">[Olapade]</a>: And I think that what's happening here is that we are all noticing and recognizing that this can't happen.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10706.553s">[Olapade]</a>: We can't do it this way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10707.593s">[Olapade]</a>: Our students deserve more.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10708.914s">[Olapade]</a>: And I hope that we continue to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10711.315s">[Olapade]</a>: advocate for that and work towards finding some way that we can avoid these cuts or in ways when if we do have to have these cuts how we can consolidate properly so that student experience inside out to the classroom is not being affected in any direct way.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10726.332s">[Olapade]</a>: I think what's most important to recognize is that our students here are speaking not only from their personal experience from the experiences of those they are part of their kinship, the people that they're recognizing people that they're seeing as being ones who need to speak for what they believe in, and I can't thank you enough for being here and speaking for your experience.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10745.73s">[Olapade]</a>: I wanted to speak to Jerry if he's still here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10750.236s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10750.636s">[Olapade]</a>: I said two quick questions on the slideshow so on slide five, and I just mentioned before from the previous meeting on May 6, you know, the the bullet points some theater sections will be offered as part of a teaching assignment to align with student interest.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10765.601s">[Olapade]</a>: How are we clarifying or how do we determine student interest because evidently students want these types of programs I understand that this particular point suggests that students are not as interested in the in school, you know theater program necessarily but out of school of course that's the case.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10779.685s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10821.0s">[Olapade]</a>: And then on slide 11, with the guidance counselor for the FY 25 staffing, according to this, that you're not going to reduce the MHS staffing in any way, but for the McGlynn and the Andrews,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10832.014s">[Olapade]</a>: If we just, you know, just do the basic math if you were to reduce the MHS from six to four and then move to those counselors to the ones that make land one of the interest to maintain those staffing numbers from FY 24 at the middle school levels, I mean at the elementary, you would have a, you know, to 220.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10848.391s">[Olapade]</a>: students to one counselor, and then you would have a 295 to one counselor at the MHS, which is more consistent with the national averages you're suggesting.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10856.176s">[Olapade]</a>: I don't love using national averages.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10858.718s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm sure most of us would not like to, and I understand that we might have to in this unfortunate case, but that seems to be more consistent with that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10902.903s">[Olapade]</a>: And then I think the last comment is kind of piggyback off what I said previously, I think that when we are receiving emails and communications from people in the public and we're seeing parents and students, most primarily saying, how do we advocate for our students when we're not seeing that from our government.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10919.331s">[Olapade]</a>: We're not noticing how they're being supported and that's their responsibility and I think it's our responsibility to find ways that we're actually doing that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10925.354s">[Olapade]</a>: And I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10926.855s">[Olapade]</a>: At what point does it stop, because I think that member Graham mentioned that if we continue this, the previous meeting when we, if we continue the system of not making decisions that are going to financially support our students, people are going to come here and people are going to stay here and we're seeing that trend, the middle school and high school level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10942.564s">[Olapade]</a>: And I think that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10944.265s">[Olapade]</a>: I don't know how to make the immediate fix and I'm not sure we necessarily have one direct fix and I think cuts is not the way, especially at this level.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10951.394s">[Olapade]</a>: And then we have the other amount of money that isn't really being discussed that could be even more cuts potentially and so I think that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10958.57s">[Olapade]</a>: I just don't know what we do if cuts is the only fix, because at what point do we then start cutting programs?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10965.012s">[Olapade]</a>: Because that's not on the table now, but that will become a problem if we continue down this path.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10970.554s">[Olapade]</a>: And I understand that you're not the one that created the system that we currently live in financially, but I think that we need to continue figuring out ways to avoid cuts.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/3RWkmZ9GDFQ&t=10978.917s">[Olapade]</a>: I know that our student representative suggested a prop two and a half, and other ways that we can improve our financial situation here at Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1207.82s">[Olapade]</a>: Here's I'm sorry to interject here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1209.901s">[Olapade]</a>: Here's a question.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1211.321s">[Olapade]</a>: Has there been some thought at all about<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1214.563s">[Olapade]</a>: the moving of one of the middle schools that's in that area and replacing it with the high school?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1219.147s">[Olapade]</a>: Because I know that I've spoken to some people in the community, and this is a question on my own, where if you're to have the high school be more centrally located, as we're talking about, let's say, if you were to replace it with the Andrews, let's just say for the moment, you move the Andrews closer to the West Medford area, so you have both an elementary school in the Brooks, and then you have a middle school in the West Medford, slightly more North Medford area, for example, and then you have the,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1242.964s">[Olapade]</a>: Kindergarten through high school, you know more central central to South Medford, okay So Would that be I mean, that's not crazy.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1281.922s">[Olapade]</a>: Absolutely.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1283.242s">[Olapade]</a>: I think, I mean, it's not a matter of, oh, we should just<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1287.296s">[Olapade]</a>: remove the building is it, is it at all possible to, again, just as because we're just you know praying on Hail Mary's here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1294.065s">[Olapade]</a>: Could you, could you redo the Andrews for example and make it high school age student and that age appropriate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1303.891s">[Olapade]</a>: for example, because I don't want to level the building or start from scratch.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1307.332s">[Olapade]</a>: I think you're right.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1307.852s">[Olapade]</a>: It's too new of a building to do what you would, in theory, do and start from the beginning.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1312.412s">[Olapade]</a>: But could you use that as a foundation to say, we know how much space we've been using thus far for the Andrews.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1319.574s">[Olapade]</a>: Could we work off of the standing foundation of the Andrews?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1385.307s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, I think that's partly why I was thinking that McGlynn wouldn't make as much sense because to your point about the two schools, they have a bigger student population and they're having the new playground installed.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1396.67s">[Olapade]</a>: The Andrews, less students, but it's an older, it's an older amount of students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1401.611s">[Olapade]</a>: The students are a different age grouping.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1403.912s">[Olapade]</a>: That wouldn't be,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1405.772s">[Olapade]</a>: that isn't and wouldn't be present if we were to remain, keep the high school, for example, where it is.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1412.435s">[Olapade]</a>: So if we were to have the Andrews be closer to the West Bedford area, that would then mean you could have students be able to potentially stay closer to home, for example.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=1419.518s">[Olapade]</a>: That might not be a big thing we need to worry about right now, but I think the McGlynn might need to stay because of what it offers, even though the space itself is more consistent with what we would need to consider that choice.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3268.683s">[Olapade]</a>: Motion to adjourn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bv-PbDpiP-8&t=3288.447s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11600.015s">[Olapade]</a>: Aaron Olopade, 105 Brooke Street, Medford.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11603.236s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you all for having me.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11604.836s">[Olapade]</a>: Council President and City Council, thank you and good evening.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11608.237s">[Olapade]</a>: As we stand at the crossroads of tradition and progress, we as a community are called upon to make a decision that will shape the future of our city and the generations for which we hope to ensure that future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11616.979s">[Olapade]</a>: I speak to you today, not just as an elected official of the Medford School Committee, but more importantly, as a member of this great community we call home.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11623.561s">[Olapade]</a>: We all understand that our city is more than just a collection of streets and buildings, is a living, breathing, vibrant community that is a testament to our shared values and the spirit that we as Medfordites embody.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11633.885s">[Olapade]</a>: We are facing challenges today that are not new, nor are they easily fixable.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11637.907s">[Olapade]</a>: Our schools are struggling to provide the quality education our students deserve, our road and building restoration efforts are hindered, and our essential services are limited in ways that create a sense of concern.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11648.011s">[Olapade]</a>: These are not abstract issues, they are real, and they affect each of us in ways that may not be discernible on the surface.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11654.616s">[Olapade]</a>: To address these challenges, we must bridge the social and ideological gap and make a collective investment in our future, investment being the operative word.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11662.481s">[Olapade]</a>: This is why I'm speaking in favor of the 2.5 prop increase and its current wording.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11666.184s">[Olapade]</a>: I understand that the word tax often carries a heavy burden for many, and it's natural to be concerned or fearful about the financial impact to oneself, one's family, and one's assets.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11676.451s">[Olapade]</a>: But I ask us to all consider what this increase could mean for our community.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11680.322s">[Olapade]</a>: It represents our commitment to ensuring that every child in our city has access to top-notch equitable education, our dedication to maintaining our municipal buildings and grounds, and providing aid to our civil service workers and the associate personnel with the resources they need to operate.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11694.155s">[Olapade]</a>: A 2.5 increase in property taxes is not just a financial decision, it's a moral one.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11699.18s">[Olapade]</a>: It's a testament to our willingness to support one another,<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11701.721s">[Olapade]</a>: to lift each other up in times of need and to invest in the common good.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11705.444s">[Olapade]</a>: This increase will enable us to fund critical infrastructure projects, support local businesses, and create programs that uplift the most vulnerable among us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11713.289s">[Olapade]</a>: We must remember that a city is only as strong as the bonds that unite its people.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11717.172s">[Olapade]</a>: By supporting this tax increase, we are saying that we believe in our city, its people, and ultimately its potential.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11722.875s">[Olapade]</a>: We are affirming that we care deeply about our neighbors, our children, and our future.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11726.803s">[Olapade]</a>: This is a pivotal moment for all of us.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11728.803s">[Olapade]</a>: Let us choose to be a community that rises to the occasion, that understands the value of solidarity and shared responsibility.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11735.104s">[Olapade]</a>: Let us be a community that does not shy away from challenges, but faces them head on with courage and compassion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11740.845s">[Olapade]</a>: Together, we can ensure that our city remains a place where our youth can be nurtured, our families supported, our kinships acknowledged, and the opportunities available are limitless.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11749.927s">[Olapade]</a>: I ask you to join me in supporting this investment, not just as a financial necessity, but as a statement that our commitment to Medford is rekindled.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/h9rFEwBYeQg&t=11756.65s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2713.288s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you very so.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2714.83s">[Olapade]</a>: So I have some opinions on this as a former member of City Year Boston.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2719.835s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm excited to see that the possible partnership does exist.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2722.537s">[Olapade]</a>: I think the mission and the goals of City Year as an entity, as an AmeriCorps program is phenomenal.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2728.904s">[Olapade]</a>: I had a great time doing it when I graduated from high school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2731.746s">[Olapade]</a>: I was working in an eighth grade mathematics course in Charlestown.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2735.911s">[Olapade]</a>: And so I got to work hand-in-hand with educators, the administrative staff of Edwards Middle School, and then City or Boston themselves.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2746.314s">[Olapade]</a>: A couple of things for people to know on the committee.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2749.175s">[Olapade]</a>: One of the really interesting things about how City Year operates is that we receive quite a bit of formal training preceding our time in the schools.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2758.177s">[Olapade]</a>: And while we're in our program, we're still receiving that training.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2761.899s">[Olapade]</a>: We have a lot of one-on-one<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2764.283s">[Olapade]</a>: coursework that we go through.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2766.444s">[Olapade]</a>: We did about six weeks of training preceding the start of the school year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2770.565s">[Olapade]</a>: Full-time every single day going to work sites, working with your team.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2775.226s">[Olapade]</a>: You then are landed in a work site around the greater Boston area and you'll work with your team for the full year depending on your preferences or your ability and your age will determine how you are posted to your workspace.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2788.791s">[Olapade]</a>: So<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2790.856s">[Olapade]</a>: Only college graduates are allowed to work with high school age students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2794.377s">[Olapade]</a>: City as an entity usually is from the 3rd grade to the 10th grade.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2798.119s">[Olapade]</a>: We understand through research and a lot of studies that 3rd grade, 8th grade, and 10th grade are the focal points of maturization, and that's where a lot of students find themselves needing to determine if they can continue on with the current coursework that is being given to them by the state or by their school.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2814.845s">[Olapade]</a>: By the third grade, that's when research has determined that if a student is falling behind, hitting certain academic thresholds, they'll never recover.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2823.17s">[Olapade]</a>: If they can't continue to find those thresholds, more often than not, it's going to be harder and harder for them to find the missing material and retention that they need to stack up against their peers, which is why City Year has continued to be an entity that's, I think, in over 30 states, probably, and three different continents at this point.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2842.92s">[Olapade]</a>: I found a great love for doing the work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2844.422s">[Olapade]</a>: It's what got me excited about education in general, was that work right after high school, working as an 18, 19-year-old, working in a classroom with a partner teacher, getting to work with a subsection of the class each day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2857.692s">[Olapade]</a>: You're in class all day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2859.233s">[Olapade]</a>: They do a lot of really good work.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2861.435s">[Olapade]</a>: I will say that as we continue to have a conversation about a partnership, I want to make sure that we're conscious about how they're not treated and we shouldn't treat them as full-time teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2871.963s">[Olapade]</a>: They don't have the education or the certifications to be that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2874.846s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm not suggesting that that's what's happening here, but it's important that we as a district understand that they are support staff who have done really good work and are there to support our educators and our teachers as much as possible and the community that they'll be working in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2888.86s">[Olapade]</a>: But they are not, I don't think that we should treat them as being full-time staff.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2893.324s">[Olapade]</a>: because they don't have the qualifications to do that.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2895.644s">[Olapade]</a>: And so as we continue to figure out how we're going to implement a team in one or more schools, I think it's important that we are communicating just religiously with that school about how they'll fit into a classroom day in day, every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2911.988s">[Olapade]</a>: Because with my school and how my program worked, I was working with the same teacher every day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2916.348s">[Olapade]</a>: Some schools need to have different needs, so you might be switching from one teacher to another.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2920.089s">[Olapade]</a>: But my school, the primary focus was one teacher each day.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2923.271s">[Olapade]</a>: Math and English are the two primary focuses of City Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2926.654s">[Olapade]</a>: Now that may have changed in the last five years since I did it, but math and English were the two focus subjects.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2931.677s">[Olapade]</a>: Social emotional learning was a really big thing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2934.139s">[Olapade]</a>: Teen mentoring was another big part of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2936.22s">[Olapade]</a>: Outside community programming was another big part of City Year.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2938.702s">[Olapade]</a>: So there's so many benefits this organization has to offer any community, any district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2944.726s">[Olapade]</a>: It's really important that we understand that<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2947.128s">[Olapade]</a>: They have a mission and a plan as an entity, as an organization, and they, I think, do a good job of trying to fit into what each district is asking of them.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2957.598s">[Olapade]</a>: It's a matter of how do we, I think, utilize their skill set and what they're offering us to the best of that cost to us of that $100,000 at the reduced rate that the superintendent mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2969.486s">[Olapade]</a>: So those are just some of the first thoughts that I had about this and I'm excited about the potential of it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2973.648s">[Olapade]</a>: I just want to make sure we're really careful about how we're implementing them and what that actually looks like for the students especially, but the teachers themselves and that we're not leaning on them too much because that's going to potentially burden the staff in general in a way that we don't want.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2989.477s">[Olapade]</a>: It's going to put us in a position where we're not conscious about the lack of<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=2994.52s">[Olapade]</a>: certified, you know, educated, educate teachers, when we have a support staff who are there to support us the best of our ability.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3002.15s">[Olapade]</a>: So thank you for letting me rant for a moment.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3197.387s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes, I heard it through a family friend of ours.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3200.108s">[Olapade]</a>: When I was looking at college opportunities, we had the opportunity to attend a City Year sponsored event.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3208.431s">[Olapade]</a>: The former executive director, Sandra Lopez-Burke, I believe her name was, was one of the panelists at the discussion.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3215.854s">[Olapade]</a>: So I was able to speak with her after the event, and she kind of illustrates some of the things that City Year was doing.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3221.897s">[Olapade]</a>: And I was a senior at the time, and it really excited me about what they were offering students.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3227.338s">[Olapade]</a>: You know, in the major city and I thought that it was a really cool opportunity for people who are graduating from high school and college and that that you know gap year period where you kind of had some more time to discern your interest in what you want to pursue, and so I was able to apply and work in.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3242.714s">[Olapade]</a>: in close proximity with her city or Boston's headquarters is the same headquarters building as city or as the entire nonprofit, I still believe.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3250.941s">[Olapade]</a>: And so that was a really cool opportunity for me to be in that space and see, I think people who were super charged about the educational opportunity that they were offering to students and supportive of our teachers.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=3262.191s">[Olapade]</a>: And so that was what got me excited and interested in the program originally about five, six years ago.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7516.541s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7519.063s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7901.57s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, so just a couple quick, you know, just line items that I'm sure will be explained very, I know that the most important thing for I think the committee understand that I'm sure we all do is that just the costs of living have gone up.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7913.435s">[Olapade]</a>: So a lot of the ways that we need to pay for things have gone up as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7916.997s">[Olapade]</a>: For example, when we're looking at the special education line item, you know, there's an increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7922.253s">[Olapade]</a>: I can just find it right here that goes up from the 2023 2024 from 15 million to upwards of 19.5 million.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7930.18s">[Olapade]</a>: So just things like that where there are those really noticeable increases, I'm assuming it's just because of cost more than any other flagship programming that we're doing or any major differences in the district.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7941.151s">[Olapade]</a>: If that's untrue, that might be really good for us to have some more<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=7946.215s">[Olapade]</a>: direct explanation from the administration about how those programs might be costing us, but if it's just increased because of cost of living, then that's something that I don't necessarily need more clarification on.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/2sWy59yRtEY&t=11575.802s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm happy to waive the first reading, like member Reinfeld mentioned.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2410.574s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you so much for this presentation.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2412.916s">[Olapade]</a>: I have a couple of quick questions.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2415.139s">[Olapade]</a>: So on the first slide about the 251 students that were recommended compared to the 201 that actually attended, was the reduction from the recommendation to the actual because of...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2425.981s">[Olapade]</a>: parental decisions or was it a?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2465.216s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2466.137s">[Olapade]</a>: And then for the dates and times slide with the six week, four week and various programs, is there a set duration for each program or is it the same for all of them?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2475.502s">[Olapade]</a>: And then it just depended on the total amount.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2500.6s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2501.141s">[Olapade]</a>: And then...<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2502.062s">[Olapade]</a>: for each student that gets directed towards one program or another, is that based off both the recommendation of the department plus the conjunction with their parental or their custodian, like whoever's working with them day to day in their classroom and their parents?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=2551.059s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you so much.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3240.905s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3241.665s">[Olapade]</a>: A question about the students that are entered into this program.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3244.026s">[Olapade]</a>: Is there a process in which we work with them going to the next school year about how to either be more consistent with attendance or about how to kind of work with your teachers after school about making sure that they're not in danger of falling behind their credits just so that understandably that these students were struggling to begin with.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3260.051s">[Olapade]</a>: Are there ways for us to kind of continue to support them going forward that they may not have had previously?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=3318.198s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4924.631s">[Olapade]</a>: Mayor.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4928.318s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4929.038s">[Olapade]</a>: For the high school enrollment data, is it possible for us, it doesn't have to be, obviously, right this moment, but could we have the Medford High block separate to the Medford High plus the vocational program, just so that we understand how those numbers are changing for the current time?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/qepI_nDiY5s&t=4943.302s">[Olapade]</a>: Is that possible?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=273.139s">[Olapade]</a>: Here.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=367.364s">[Olapade]</a>: Second.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=418.76s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=422.323s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1713.102s">[Olapade]</a>: I'm like Larry, I can offer to support.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1715.824s">[Olapade]</a>: I have no experience in this particular, but I'm happy to learn if people feel like I would be an addition, I'm happy to be involved, but I do not have any experience directly.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/0u-fMI_TT0Q&t=1727.153s">[Olapade]</a>: So, yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9522.134s">[Olapade]</a>: uh so thank you mayor and thank you for doing this i have two questions you mentioned briefly that for other grade levels i'm assuming this is just for seniors not for juniors and below okay but juniors and below can have a spot and do we have what we need spots wise or is this a lottery system to determine who gets a spot i've been told that we have the amount of spots okay<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=9595.677s">[Olapade]</a>: And then my second question is, is that when it comes to cleanup costs at the end of the year, what does that look like?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/dAjG9wnL6rU&t=11394.254s">[Olapade]</a>: Motion to approve.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2762.142s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2762.543s">[Olapade]</a>: Um, so a question for both the DEP team or the assistant superintendent comments about flushing protocol I understand that every three years with the LCR rule suggests that that's been like the EPA suggesting every three year for testing but<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2777.182s">[Olapade]</a>: If we go above the 15 parts per billion, it changes to a different protocol timeline.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2783.51s">[Olapade]</a>: What does flushing actually mean?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2785.232s">[Olapade]</a>: Like, I keep hearing it, but I want to understand better, like, what that protocol actually looks like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2788.136s">[Olapade]</a>: What's the methodology that we use?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2789.778s">[Olapade]</a>: Why is it that we do that compared to some other method of cleaning up the system?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2793.863s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2889.273s">[Olapade]</a>: So it's not a flushing of the entire water system, it's just specific portions of the building?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2894.535s">[Olapade]</a>: Correct.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2896.423s">[Olapade]</a>: And then I guess I actually want to agree with my fellow committee member I think that there should be some explanation about how the actual costs, how we're incurring those costs of the, the yearly or try yearly testing just because I think that there's a way for us to<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2911.938s">[Olapade]</a>: afforded if depending what the cost would be to having a more more consistent process just because evidently even though we these buildings were built post the 84 rule about changing the piping that's still an issue evidently so I think there is a way for us to kind of have a conversation about testing more consistently I would like to know how to do that as well.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/kgJb8ZwdaF0&t=2931.802s">[Olapade]</a>: Thank you.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5015.785s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, I can say really quickly, so I know where we have to go.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5018.126s">[Olapade]</a>: I can say just from a younger perspective, I think needs increase.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5021.388s">[Olapade]</a>: We understand that as we kind of continue to develop as a city, we're noticing as the school side that the needs of students are increasing individually, as a family, as a school system.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5030.473s">[Olapade]</a>: Every single person is needing more to be assisted to meet their needs of education success, educational equity, and the like.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5036.896s">[Olapade]</a>: So I think it's really important to understand that the needs of the city 40 years ago, the needs of the city 20 years ago, or even five years ago, pre-COVID, are comparably different than they are today.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5047.04s">[Olapade]</a>: And so I think that though I understand that there seems to be this understanding of how money is so drastically different than it once was, we have to understand that at least on the school side of things, the needs are so severely different now.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5057.343s">[Olapade]</a>: And that's why there isn't a new need financially, a new shift of how we can<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5062.385s">[Olapade]</a>: I think that as someone who was recently both in university and in the school system here, I can tell you that it is incredibly important that even our school spaces are incredibly important.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5071.231s">[Olapade]</a>: I think there is a population that feels though that as long as you're being taught by someone who really does care about the students and you're a student who really cares about the material, the school space and the environment you're learning in isn't nearly as important as those two core components.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5085.259s">[Olapade]</a>: but we are, we do understand through statistics and through studies that the school space, the learning space is just as important as a teacher who's partly committed to the work and a student who wants to learn.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/eYLl0XsNfvs&t=5095.443s">[Olapade]</a>: So we have to understand that these needs are shifting, and I want us to understand that that's what's happening, that's why the money's changing, I think, as much as it has been in the past couple of years.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=457.092s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=457.192s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=457.293s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=457.473s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=457.733s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=458.354s">[Olapade]</a>: Yes.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1104.132s">[Olapade]</a>: So if you go up to the part D of the reporting section of discrimination.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1111.134s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, bullet four.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=1115.046s">[Olapade]</a>: which I agree with Maru, so that doesn't make, how do you determine?<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2144.935s">[Olapade]</a>: Step seven, if you keep going down further.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2468.402s">[Olapade]</a>: If I may, it seems like it's reading as if the timeline coordinator will not discipline a party witness or other participating entity if they make a false statement about sex discrimination, or if they felt as though it was, but it was not actually based off of the determining criteria after a review process had occurred.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2489.147s">[Olapade]</a>: So there will be no repercussions towards the original respondent.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=2494.748s">[Olapade]</a>: I think is how it reads.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3437.369s">[Olapade]</a>: I think another difficulty is trying to, if there are components of things that we want to change without changing like state or federal guidelines and the terminology that they're using.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3449.735s">[Olapade]</a>: So I don't want to do anything that's going outside of what their expectations or recommendations are.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3455.378s">[Olapade]</a>: So we're not kind of following their requirements.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3459.42s">[Olapade]</a>: So that's another difficulty, I think.<br><br>

    <a href="https://youtu.be/bQ7rGA39hAo&t=3583.137s">[Olapade]</a>: Yeah, I'll make a motion.<br><br>
