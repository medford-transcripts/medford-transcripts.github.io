 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6237.342s">Hi,</a> Erin DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn street. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6239.723s">Uh,</a> I live in the Hillside and the number of rats in the area has grown tremendously, especially this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6248.323s">I</a> personally called the health department less than a week ago and they're extremely helpful and very receptive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6255.285s">I</a> think accountability has to come in play. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6257.666s">I</a> think people aren't taking care of the weeds in their lawns and they hibernate in the ground and they make holes in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6265.808s">So</a> people think, and they live near food sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6269.43s">So</a> gardens, fruit trees, those types of things, and they need water. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6274.051s">So</a> they're gonna live near those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6278.416s">My</a> question is, if you do create this commission or whatever, would you go to different areas of the city and speak on this issue in a community way? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6291.145s">Like,</a> go up to Hillside, gather the people there, go to the South Methodist Fire Station, have a meeting there, go to the community and educate them in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6302.412s">It</a> has to be hands-on, and if you really <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6306.034s">communicate</a> to them, you're there in their area to help them and hear their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6311.001s">I</a> think that going out to the community rather than just robo calls and on the online, and you really see the people that you are representing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6321.997s">face-to-face</a> in that they see how much you care about this issue, they'll all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6327.219s">They'll</a> talk about, I mean, I have no problem ratting someone else for not taking care of their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6333.662s">And</a> that's how I feel because I am afraid of rodents. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6337.464s">And</a> that owner, and if they're renting, I'm like, you're collecting the rent, pay someone to do it if you can't do it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6345.407s">If</a> you're elderly, get some help, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6348.953s">but</a> don't leave it so the rest of us have to live with rats. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6352.795s">That's</a> one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6353.676s">So</a> the community piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6354.997s">The</a> other piece is, Walkling Court is scheduled for demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6362.081s">Is</a> there a plan in place for the hillside area on rodents? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6369.325s">Is</a> that part of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6370.726s">How</a> much money is allocated to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6373.148s">What</a> are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6373.988s">What</a> are we pre-planning? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6374.869s">Because</a> I live in that neighborhood and I haven't heard anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6379.511s">I</a> know they'll reach out to the media community about like 400 feet from the building, but what about the rest of us that live in that area? <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6387.357s">We</a> need notification and we need notification about how, what they're doing to mitigate that before it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6393.141s">Cause</a> everybody who's talking about it, I'm worried when that happens, just like the green line, which I walked by yesterday and I read this big, walked in front of me at 5.20 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6406.414s">I</a> won't walk after seven o'clock because the rats come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6410.295s">It's</a> pretty bad when it's still sunny and they're walking in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6414.617s">So</a> I'm just, I'm really grateful that this is being addressed and I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6425.452s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j7cOY__Bzdc&t=6426.372s">My</a> time must be up.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=6994.632s">Hi,</a> Aaron Benedetto 21 Dearborn Street, so I know they are very well that's my word. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7001.74s">Really</a> City Hall is our best location based on availability of parking ADA compliance <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7009.369s">and</a> just generally available for all people to come and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FLTVHcz7fAI&t=7014.83s">I</a> know it's a little further than some of the other places you have, but we have vetted those places and they are not as accommodating as we need either for the reasons I stated before.<h2><a href="../2023-04-03_bPsPwj5vBSI/2023-04-03_bPsPwj5vBSI.html">MSC Budget Committee of the Whole - 4.3.2023</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2630.04s">You're</a> unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2631.822s">I</a> was trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2632.743s">It</a> wasn't allowing me and then they asked me not to. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2634.984s">But</a> anyway, Erin DiBenedetto, 21 <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2636.726s">Hamlin</a> St. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2638.307s">First</a> of all, I'm all for putting more of the energy through their power system as long as it's <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2647.341s">quiet,</a> and it has been for quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2654.007s">I</a> also need to comment that the construction that's going on up across right now, they're not being neat with keeping things off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2663.616s">Even</a> tonight as I walked by, there was piles of sand and rock in the street with cones wrapped around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2672.293s">and</a> some trash bags behind a barrier that really doesn't, that barrier doesn't need to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2678.876s">I've</a> called a couple of city Councilors and Vice President Rick Caraviello has been very helpful in getting them to clear that area so the street stays wide and safe for both pedestrians and cars.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2699.545s">It</a> goes to speak as just when they're doing the Boston Ave project, I hope that they keep that area safe and clean as they do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2708.135s">It's</a> a great improvement for their community, but while they're building, they need to be aware of the hillside community. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2715.16s">Also,</a> I would like to be re-added to the emails that Rocco mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2720.383s">I</a> just want to be clear that not all- What information, Mr. President?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2748.902s">Okay,</a> I respect that Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2751.885s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that the project is safe for the residents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=2756.169s">So</a> yes, I'm in favor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4425.779s">Thank</a> you, President Flanagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4427.74s">Erin</a> DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4430.02s">I</a> agree wholeheartedly with the addition of Tufts filing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4435.082s">We</a> don't know in our neighborhood what is happening and what construction is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4440.024s">And</a> if the city council is where I go to when I ask those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4445.666s">So</a> it would be really nice if you had that information as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XL6CFVX_DxQ&t=4449.567s">So</a> I'm hoping that the council or one of the councilors will amend the amendment to include Tufts University.<h2><a href="../2019-12-18_jsdIPdqDPt8/2019-12-18_jsdIPdqDPt8.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 16, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2640.654s">Looking</a> for my report. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2647.402s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2649.445s">It</a> was right in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2652.135s">So</a> we had our first meeting of the year for the special education subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2659.076s">We</a> had many administrators present, Diane Caldwell, Joan Bowen, Toni Wray, Paulette VanDeKoop, my associates, Paul Rousseau, Jenny Graham, the school committee elect member, Jenny Graham, Neil Osborne, Emily. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2678.393s">Lazzaro,</a> Lisa Kingsley from the Curtis Huff School, Melanie McLaughlin who will also take office soon as a school committee member, Tonya and Alex Lurie, Tonya Solomon. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2691.1s">So</a> we had this meeting to go over what we accomplished last year and we had set forth two goals last year and we made tremendous amount of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2701.165s">And</a> the first goal for the community was raising disability awareness training and <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2709.818s">And</a> just helping our summer out of school time activities for our students with special needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2716.284s">Before</a> school, after school, summer camp, vacation camps, and we did a lot of work, especially Diane Caldwell, on new handbooks, more parent friendly, <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2730.805s">and</a> to make it friendly for families that have students with needs to come forward so we know ahead of time and can plan for those students' needs and be ready for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2743.254s">And</a> we also try to get parents to enroll earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2747.938s">So</a> we have staffing and <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2751.422s">we're</a> set up appropriately for all of our students in the summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2755.966s">So,</a> look forward to that in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2758.789s">Registration</a> will be going out earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2762.873s">So,</a> and together we wanted to raise awareness and especially like in curriculum and use examples of <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2773.263s">challenging</a> situations that students could have more empathy and more inclusion of all students' needs in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2783.454s">And</a> Shelly Gross ran some programming for our teachers and it was a great hit and more of that is going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2790.16s">So</a> those goals are going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2792.122s">And</a> we talked about what goals we'd set forth for the next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2798.084s">And</a> since I won't be chairing the committee, no decisions were made on those goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2802.366s">And</a> we felt like the new chairperson would bring those goals forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2808.529s">But</a> we did identify some areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2811.331s">Looking</a> at special education curriculum, what's being taught and how it's being taught was one idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2817.634s">And</a> community hosting accessible recreation programs was another idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2829.022s">Increasing</a> the programming at the Curtis Huff School was an idea, and focusing on students with disability in our upper grades, because sometimes we focus a lot on the <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2840.032s">lower</a> grades in teaching students to self-advocate at those grade levels, and maybe a unified sports program similar to the one that they have in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2852.084s">And</a> to get Medford more involved with the Challenger event that Malden is very involved in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2859.771s">I</a> know that a lot of us went to Challenger Day, and I'd love to see a larger participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2865.621s">And</a> some of these aren't year-long goals, but they're quick hits that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2869.625s">And</a> whoever runs this committee, I think hopefully some of my colleagues that have been serving on it will continue at least one. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2881.718s">So</a> there's some history brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2884.0s">But</a> it's been a great committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2887.215s">The</a> keeping the goals to one or two, possibly three, is very important in my mind because you can see effective change. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2896.304s">You</a> can really work on issues and dig in on them and make a difference in children's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2902.17s">If</a> you have 20 goals, it's very hard to meet all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2905.994s">So</a> that's our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2910.603s">It's</a> been a great honor to be the chairperson of that committee, and I'm glad that the mayor established that and that we are serving our students in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=2919.609s">So</a> thank you. <a

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5156.54s">I</a> just want to say thank you to my family for giving up time with me to give me time to serve this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5164.763s">Service</a> is a big part of our family life and I'm blessed to have served Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/jsdIPdqDPt8&t=5170.065s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-12-17_cflR-3VqII8/2019-12-17_cflR-3VqII8.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 18, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=823.628s">Welcome.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2323.45s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2324.794s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2325.014s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2326.014s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2327.035s">To</a> follow up about South Street, can we make sure that an auto call is sent? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2332.696s">So</a> especially with how cold it's been, we don't want to accidentally have any children waiting out there for the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2340.799s">We</a> can definitely do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2343.06s">And</a> just maybe to everyone, because kids might take a bus home to that area to walk to a grandparent's or a caregiver's <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2354.859s">House,</a> not just the kids that necessarily are living right in that area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2368.83s">Definitely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2369.531s">And</a> just, I don't know if we're gonna discuss it now, but there has been some emails and letters of concerns of bus crowding, but we can wait till further in this meeting, but especially middle school buses being overcrowded at the end of the day, going home now that some clubs have ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2391.226s">So</a> I don't know if you could look into that and get us an update.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=2396.049s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3544.766s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3545.286s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3546.466s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3548.247s">My</a> question is more about funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3550.147s">This</a> program is now so important to our community, our school community, as well as our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3559.33s">If</a> for any reason this grant doesn't come through, we need to make sure that there's a plan B. I'm sure my colleagues, as the year continues, will help you in the budget if that wasn't to come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3573.982s">And</a> somehow some way, but are there is there a plan B other than the Cummings are we reaching out to? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3580.285s">Mr.</a> Bloomberg again, what are we doing?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3633.501s">And</a> what costs are involved? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3635.263s">Like,</a> what do you need each year to be able to run this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3638.545s">I</a> mean, if we put it out there and people are listening and they hear these children, there might be a donor out there that is listening right now or at some point and hear what you need and be able to step up and help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3651.617s">So</a> if anybody's listening, we could use checks for CCSR.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=3687.146s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4329.102s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4330.163s">How</a> did this money come about? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4332.446s">Did</a> you apply for a grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4334.162s">I</a> applied for a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4335.043s">So</a> I just wanted to say thank you very much on behalf of the students and the community, the school community, to take that initiative on and apply for grants that help our students should be recognized because that's very important in tough times. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4351.137s">And</a> this gives children an opportunity to work with their hands and their minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4355.581s">And</a> that's a great benefit that you've just offered all of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4359.684s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4430.441s">Very</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4431.022s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4431.782s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4432.803s">I</a> just wanted people to know that the current cosmetology is going to remain open while you're building the new area. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4440.788s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4450.054s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4450.455s">So</a> just so the community does know that during construction and during the movement, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4455.591s">that</a> they can still go and get treatments and services in the spa currently.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4462.48s">Which</a> when I broke my arm, I took advantage of a few years ago and brought my mom and my sister and everybody got something different meals here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4471.411s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4473.319s">everything,</a> and it was helpful because I had that broken arm, so I appreciated it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4478.243s">So</a> everybody in the community should really utilize these programs that they have up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4482.906s">I</a> don't know how many customers they're getting right now, but it's a great option. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4488.11s">You</a> can get your oil changed, your hair and nails done, or any other cosmetology thing that they offer, and then go to lunch and pick up your car and you're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4498.538s">It's</a> a great way to spend the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4500.08s">It</a> might take you a little longer to get your hair cut or done, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4503.282s">than</a> at your regular spa, but it's really, it's really a great, great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=4511.012s">And</a> just wanted to let everybody know to go to utilize it even while we're relocating.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6322.148s">I</a> have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6324.469s">In</a> order to get people to take these jobs, we have to offer <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6331.293s">at</a> least minimum wage, just like every other employer in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6335.295s">And</a> it would be very upsetting if we continued and did not at least offer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6340.537s">So</a> that's my first thing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6359.162s">So</a> you're telling me it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6360.362s">Okay,</a> so I'd like that update at our next meeting and the explanation as to what we're paying and what the rule is, and if not, what our moral obligation is as an employer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6375.747s">So</a> I would request that through the superintendent, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6380.22s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6381.401s">Thank</a> you for putting this all together in the year and a half, almost two years that you've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6387.203s">I</a> know you hit the ground running. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6389.083s">I</a> know you had a whole program to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6391.564s">I</a> know Diane Caldwell was doing this program prior to you as well as her other jobs and I thank her for all those years of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6400.068s">But</a> the reason we can't expand is because we have someone in your position that does care about not only the students but the staff and the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6409.658s">and</a> take pride in all pieces of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6412.179s">So</a> I applaud you for your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6414.9s">I</a> also do agree with my colleagues that there are more people on the wait list than you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6420.438s">These</a> are the people who have signed on to the wait list, and I know personal family members who have not even applied because they feel like it would take too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6431.6s">But</a> I don't agree with everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6435.241s">I</a> don't agree with keeping it secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6437.402s">I</a> agree with telling everybody what a great program it is, and everybody has a chance to get in there in April, and that just because you're in there now doesn't guarantee <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6449.064s">your</a> seat forever and that you should take a chance and apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6453.227s">And</a> maybe recommend people that they know to become employed within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6460.211s">Celebrate</a> some of the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6461.853s">Highlight</a> them on our online. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6464.114s">Highlight</a> them in our paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6466.456s">Show</a> that Medford is here working for working class families. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6471.419s">That</a> we do provide great care for our students after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6474.921s">That</a> we are in need of more people <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6478.164s">to</a> staff these because the more we talk about it and celebrate it, the more people who have retired might want to do two days a week and come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6488.192s">Celebrate</a> some of those things and do it like a PR outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6493.897s">Yeah,</a> and just make people excited like the CCSR kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6498.161s">get</a> them down to do projects in the afternoon and commit to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6501.183s">We</a> do have one CCR project. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6502.284s">She's</a> coming to teach music to our little guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6504.285s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6505.326s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6505.927s">So</a> there's 150 kids from Medford High School that do volunteer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6511.711s">And</a> I know you've exhausted very, very many ways of hiring people. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6517.355s">I</a> might have thrown you a few myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6519.736s">But</a> I commend the work that you do for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6523.219s">And</a> I just ask that we, moving forward, make sure that all our people are paid well. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6528.393s">and</a> we celebrate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6530.134s">Also,</a> you should know what the income is. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6532.455s">You</a> should know that whole budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6534.095s">I</a> know it's not, it's a separate entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6537.756s">I</a> think having that information, finding out if there is extra money there to lure people in, to keep people for longer is an important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6547.32s">So</a> I also ask this committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6551.337s">to</a> ask the superintendent to have the assistant superintendent provide us with the budget and where we are now and what we've spent so far this year on this program, what has come in, what has gone out, what we're paying for, an updated budget on this, as well as I think our school committee is due for a budget analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6573.019s">complete</a> budget analysis where we are so far in our school budget, so I, you know, I request that that be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6580.812s">Yeah,</a> I know, but I think that's coming, but in addition to that, add this piece to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6588.324s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6611.297s">that</a> they need every day to learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/cflR-3VqII8&t=6612.098s">And</a> that homework is also being done so parents don't have to do it at your class.<h2><a

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1096.755s">This</a> is a great initiative, and I think it's a way to highlight the new bistro and to show other community members that they could utilize this space and rent it and do other things with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1111.064s">Once</a> we have them in the door, we can tell them about all the other great programs like getting their hair done and their oil changed and a dent pulled from their car. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1120.81s">So</a> like even if we have people there that night to just highlight some of those other things, it would be a great idea.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1132.098s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1132.478s">And</a> maybe we can even use the deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1135.53s">open</a> it up there, too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1140.493s">That</a> would be great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1142.033s">Great</a> idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1142.654s">Great</a> thinking outside the box.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1679.792s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1681.452s">First</a> of all, I want to say thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1684.553s">There's</a> a lot of work that your department's done to onboard <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1689.286s">and</a> to do exit interviews for people who have retired and left. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1693.188s">I</a> appreciate you doing it so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1694.689s">I</a> had some more questions, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1697.99s">I</a> wanted to know how many open positions do we currently have throughout the district and what those positions are, like if we do need <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1709.847s">Substitutes</a> for specific teachers or categories, how many people are on leaves and what kind of job titles we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1717.456s">So</a> I can help because I work in education. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1720.439s">I</a> might hear of people available throughout the community if the community knows that we're in a situation where we do have openings. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1727.227s">Someone</a> may have a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1729.537s">that</a> have a licensed teacher or retired teachers might see that and see the need and step up for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1736.102s">So</a> I asked for it for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1738.724s">And</a> it can be ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1740.265s">It</a> can be in the next few weeks, whenever you can get it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1800.681s">And</a> that includes like open temporary positions for short-term and long-term leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1805.687s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1806.288s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1806.888s">That's</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1808.63s">I</a> agree with my colleague about substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1812.234s">A</a> parent had asked me if substitutes or paras or other professionals within the building are trained <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1821.573s">with</a> our emergency plans for the building that they're serving in and their lockdown procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1828.339s">So</a> my hope is through the administration, there could be some type of procedure or policy in place for each building for onboarding of temporary and new staff that gets hired after the initial orientation week, just so we check all the boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1846.068s">Another</a> question that's come up is, are all people within our schools, even volunteers, are quarried?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1853.591s">Yeah,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1855.052s">Just</a> putting every question that I've received out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1858.353s">My</a> other concern is, as my colleague noted about this specific science teacher, part of the reason there was concern is because eighth grade is a year that we test for MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1869.978s">And</a> if they've had substitute last year and they're again <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1874.442s">But</a> I trust your judgment and if you're telling me that Substitute is a certified teacher and you're supporting them with the new programming and that our director of science is gonna be checking in and really helping them along the way, that I would feel comfortable telling parents that as they approach us and ask us and bring forward their concerns, which I'm really grateful for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1899.094s">We</a> get a lot of emails and a lot of reach out <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1902.71s">people</a> on my porch around town, I'll text you different things that people are asking to just clarify, because I don't know them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1911.679s">I</a> did notice today when I was on the website that I think we're not having a meeting on November 4th, so our meeting dates have to be updated there, because that hasn't been updated, just to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1925.979s">So</a> people are aware that I don't know exactly which dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1929.36s">I</a> was trying to fill out my, if we're rescheduling the next Monday is a holiday, Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1935.041s">So</a> I didn't, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1938.402s">I</a> didn't know if we were going to try it next week or after that, but it's just, just so we're all aware and on the page with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1944.983s">I</a> do try to check different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1947.024s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1949.287s">I</a> was sad to see that our nutritionists left, especially in the middle of a program, because we were really hoping for success with this new breakfast program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1957.99s">I</a> also was wondering, at the last meeting, we talked a little bit about the middle school bus just getting there right on time for class. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1964.672s">And</a> has any movement happened with that so that children are there early enough to ensure they have time to grab a breakfast or eat their breakfast before going in? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=1974.856s">I</a> know I'm putting you on the spot with that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2084.957s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2085.658s">I</a> know there's a great effort here to provide breakfast for our community, and I think it's a good start, a really good, strong start. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2094.206s">And</a> I also just, my only concern was a parent in the Hillside area expressed concern that the bus doesn't get there early enough for their child to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2104.396s">It's</a> not that they're not releasing them, it's that the bus is pulling up right on time for class, so their child doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2110.771s">It</a> doesn't affect this particular child, but it could affect other children from that area that might need time to eat. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2119.306s">because</a> it is before the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2120.987s">That's</a> just a concern when we're talking to the bus company to get them there early enough so that they can participate in all of the program, because without the participation, we're not gonna be able to continue this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2136.754s">So</a> it's very important for everybody listening to make sure their children or grandchildren go to school early and have a nice breakfast, and it sounds delicious. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2144.857s">I</a> wish that I was there to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=2147.947s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5875.111s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5876.192s">I'll</a> try to be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5877.452s">First</a> of all, when I saw this and I saw that we were only piloting two items, I was very happy because the less money we spend on assessment means more money that we might possibly have for intervention. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5891.438s">So</a> I was like, yay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5893.26s">save</a> a dime now so we can spend it later on actually making progress with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5899.105s">So</a> I had a little different take than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5901.307s">And</a> I'd also, at this point, like to make a motion that the district establish a consistent document that all parents receive after each testing just to be informed that their children, where they lied after, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5917.055s">where</a> they fell after each assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5919.798s">So</a> that way, the Columbus School, the wording is the same as the McGlynn School and at the Roberts School and every K through second, it's not teacher specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5930.37s">This</a> teacher does it during report cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5933.874s">I</a> just like it sent out a form <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5936.557s">district-wide,</a> consistency, everybody gets the same, and I request that in a motion form, and I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5971.777s">Maybe</a> the cover letter that goes with the results could be the same language and set up in the same format. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5978.43s">So</a> that way understanding is, I just want that communication piece to be given to every parent after each screening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5987.299s">So</a> that way we're consistent and we're consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5990.542s">I've</a> always been about consistency through the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5994.647s">So</a> I just want to make sure that every parent receives it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=5999.344s">after</a> every screening and any progress or any red flags are identified there in a way that we use the same language for each school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6062.143s">So</a> I'm not saying every. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6065.143s">letter</a> is gonna look the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6067.405s">All</a> the content is the same and the wording and the language that we're using as a district is the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6073.609s">The</a> district has provided three different opportunities to assess your children in reading, that type of a form thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6082.455s">These</a> are the results that we've received so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6085.236s">We</a> will update you again in the winter and in the spring and after each assessment <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6092.563s">a</a> follow-up letter goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6093.983s">So</a> that type of generalization wording, not the specific thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6097.644s">I</a> think we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6099.025s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor to make sure that that happens for every school building in the elementary schools.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6106.107s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6861.664s">So</a> I was just wondering when was the last time we did a cost analysis as to moving this in-house and hiring people from our community to take on <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6872.731s">some</a> of these tasks as opposed to outsourcing? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6876.155s">And</a> I know we have custodial staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6880.479s">Have</a> we done any looking at the cost savings by outsourcing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6886.766s">And</a> could we get that kind of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6890.929s">I</a> just thought if we can give MedFed people or surrounding towns people jobs with benefits and we can get this work done through hiring people within our community, it's a great opportunity here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6906.695s">And</a> year after year, it goes up and up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6908.696s">And</a> when was the last time we stepped back and say, what do we actually need? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6912.057s">And</a> can we hire people either part-time or full-time and provide benefits and expand our workforce? <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6918.62s">And</a> I just look at it as a possible win for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6922.361s">by</a> providing jobs, so I don't know, I haven't seen that data since I've been here for eight years, so I just thought it was appropriate time to ask for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6932.211s">And</a> even if not for this contract, I'd like to see that and make a motion for that to happen, even if we have to move forward with this contract, so that way the committee looks at this <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6943.169s">or</a> maybe we do a one-year contract while we look into this, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6947.432s">But</a> I just, if we have an opportunity to give someone a job that lives in Medford, in our schools, that takes pride in our buildings and in our students, and it's cost-effective or close to it, I would love to see that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6963.023s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=6988.606s">When</a> was that last reviewed is my question, and can we review it again?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7023.846s">I</a> totally agree, and it is last minute, and as I was sitting here, that's what came to mind, and that's why I'm bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7030.995s">So</a> what I'm requesting is <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7033.444s">by</a> December, we get a cost analysis, and maybe we move forward now, but in the future, we have that data, and more recent, and then I won't be on this committee at that point, but the committee will have data and information as to whether they wanna keep going with outsourcing, or if we wanna provide good jobs for good people who live in MedFed, and that's what I would hope that this committee does.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7099.777s">So</a> I would like to make a motion at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7103.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7103.58s">Sorry,</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7105.442s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7106.158s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion that we approve this contract for our annual contract instead of a three-year, and that cost estimate be done prior to the end of our negotiations at the end of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/UR250MtFq2M&t=7187.058s">I'd</a> like to make an amendment to that motion and add that a study be done prior to the next three-year, the end of this contract.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2176.977s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2178.378s">I</a> first wanted to comment on the patrols that go in through those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2182.859s">When</a> it first started, there were so many comments from offices on scanners that I was getting phone calls from my neighbors, what's going on at the schools, why are the police always there? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2193.462s">And</a> I said, oh, that's just them being visible and more active within our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2199.405s">And</a> people were very pleased to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2201.746s">So</a> thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2204.068s">And</a> I have some concrete questions about the program, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2208.19s">How</a> many officers will be trained? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2210.331s">Will</a> they be at all schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2213.553s">And</a> will the same officers go to the same schools so that they can build relationships? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2218.455s">Or</a> will they alternate?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2287.182s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2288.002s">Um,</a> and is there any cost involved, um, with, with funding this program to the school district?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2298.112s">Not</a> at this time, but in the future, you're anticipating any?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2316.195s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2316.775s">Thank</a> you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2318.536s">So</a> I understand your idea of getting all the officers in and through. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2324.548s">But</a> in the beginning, I think some consistency for our younger children is to getting to know them, and then switching on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2333.879s">Oh,</a> now you get a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2335.3s">That</a> consistency, especially for some of our students, it takes them time to build relationships that it might be something worth looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2344.211s">just</a> as a basic thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2346.694s">I</a> really like the idea of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2349.297s">I</a> am thrilled about it and we get books on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2353.001s">This</a> is a win-win all the way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2355.483s">I</a> really appreciate the police department's partnership with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2358.963s">and</a> the social-emotional impact it will have on the children of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2363.586s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2364.286s">Thank</a> you very much for bringing it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2835.149s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2835.569s">Thank</a> you for the updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2836.75s">I</a> really like hearing everything going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2840.012s">It</a> also reminded me about when you mentioned the free breakfast, I was at a meeting last week and a parent came up to me and said the middle school bus was getting there three minutes before the time to go to class. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2853.719s">So</a> there's really no time for those students to go and get a free breakfast before the bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2859.543s">So</a> could we look at- Yeah, I'm gonna follow up with transportation to try to figure out what- All buses, let's just check to make sure kids are there early enough to have their free breakfast.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2871.589s">It</a> didn't affect this particular family, but it just brought to light that some kids who might need breakfast <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2879.891s">really</a> need to be there early enough so they can have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2882.213s">And</a> if not, then some way those children should be allowed to have their breakfast, even if it's after the bell or somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2889.02s">I</a> will look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.021s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.462s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=2890.802s">I</a> appreciate that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3578.938s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3579.418s">First</a> of all, I'd like to thank you for all the security measures you put in place with yourself and all of the people working at our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3587.105s">The</a> lighting changes, the camera changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3590.407s">You're</a> very responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3591.668s">Your</a> department has been excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3593.79s">And</a> not just now, but you've always <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3597.551s">done</a> a great job.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3599.453s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3600.655s">At</a> this point I'd like to make a motion for this committee to move forward with studying the security director position so that way when we have this app in place we have someone to <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3613.549s">actually</a> answer that in security measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3616.351s">I</a> know that we had put it forward last year in conjunction with the city position, but since that didn't get approved, I would like to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3625.979s">I</a> think this is imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3627.56s">I</a> think we should have this in place for next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3630.422s">So</a> I need one of my colleagues to second the motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3634.605s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=3636.545s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4242.472s">I</a> look forward to hearing more about your continued progress with your learning walks, Dr. Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4249.215s">I</a> did notice on the back of requested reports, at our last meeting, I requested an update on math supplies, materials, and consumables. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4258.799s">Would</a> you just add that to the list of reports with the school committee dates? <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4264.997s">Since</a> we were talking about math blocks, I thought it was appropriate at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/CUpSL015tZc&t=4268.359s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM/2019-09-25_35_tTrt91mM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 23, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=692.58s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=693.561s">Um,</a> Joan, Joseph and I know each other very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=696.523s">His</a> older sister was also a scientist and did many activities with my daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=703.629s">So</a> I saw him as a very young child and he always <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=708.168s">had</a> this interest in science, and whatever he put his mind to, whether it was playing his instruments, or for Medford High School Orchestra, or following the girls around to the Broad when they did their internship there, I knew he was going to set off and do wonderful things. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=728.263s">I</a> just thought it would take a little longer, Joseph, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=732.265s">So</a> if this is the beginning, I can't wait to see what's next. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=735.726s">I'm</a> very proud of you, for yourself, and for MedFed, and for all the teachers that have helped you along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=743.489s">And</a> mostly because I know the two parents in this room are very similar to myself and my husband, and they're beaming with joy to see you here getting another award. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=754.053s">Because</a> this isn't your first year, and I don't think it will be your last. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=757.383s">Welcome</a> back to MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=765.667s">So</a> thanks for coming back to see us and keep coming back.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=769.769s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2880.103s">Mastone.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2904.271s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2905.712s">I</a> understand and I can feel your frustration and you want to take action immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2910.254s">I'm</a> just concerned for the students that chose to show up on Friday to now get that change, their frustration with the fact that we changed the policy and they could have gone and still marched or still played <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2925.854s">and</a> that would escalate that frustration from both their parents and those students that made a choice that was extremely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2935.541s">So</a> for that reason, I'm going to ask you as another member to just really trust that this policy will be looked at effectively by all of us, because we all want to take action immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2948.95s">And</a> what I can do is suggest that that committee meets as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2955.0s">to</a> expedite your concerns and to say that we are going to take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2961.864s">We</a> aren't going to sit very long on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2964.586s">I</a> would just hate to be one of the students that showed up and then found out that I could have gone after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2974.012s">That</a> would be very hard to process. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2977.435s">As</a> a child, that would be very hard to process. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=2980.017s">So</a> for that reason, I ask you to wait and trust in our committee, this committee, this very active committee that wants effective change to change this policy very soon and very quickly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3377.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3379.507s">That's</a> pretty much what I wanted to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3382.754s">Mr.</a> Brown was present, and he said there are a lot of experts, not only as teachers in the vocational school, but throughout the community that would love to come and be present and active on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3395.768s">And</a> a lot of the work that they could do, they could do <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3401.053s">initial</a> groundwork with the expertise we have in-house without having to pay for anything and just go over just basic information and really research things by professionals that live in the community and it wouldn't cost any money initially and then we can build on that and <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3421.448s">like</a> build with the foundation and then build up and just not incur costs right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3427.152s">So</a> that's what I wanted to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3429.373s">I</a> think it's an excellent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3431.215s">I</a> think it could be a three, five, 10 year vision for what needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3436.938s">And</a> until we see that, once we have a vision, then we can make steps to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3442.472s">And</a> we need to know where we are so we can figure out where we need to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3446.877s">So</a> I applaud this committee and its work for bringing this out from that evening and moving forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3454.706s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3742.199s">We</a> should, I would like to set up some guidelines of what that committee, since we're building the committee now, can we just put out some guidelines that who we want on that committee, and if any members would like to be on that committee could also express interest at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3759.067s">So</a> that way, Kathy already offered to be the chairperson of the committee, and I can second her being chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3767.549s">I</a> don't know if she can nominate herself.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=3807.709s">So</a> not only is it school committee members, but it's also community members and teachers May it did appoint me as the person and I requested that committee be added so in a similar way we need to have a way for people in the community to contact one person and
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5040.949s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5042.987s">I</a> have a few questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5045.028s">But</a> before we start, you said there have been a few struggles. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5048.33s">Can</a> you tell us a little bit about what those struggles have been?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5117.877s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5119.239s">Through</a> the chair to the superintendent, could you give us some information as what's holding up any orders? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5125.385s">We're</a> three weeks at least into the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5128.648s">I</a> would assume that with the new academic program, we had them up and running and ready for teachers for day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5135.755s">So</a> could we get an update either by email or <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5140.419s">somehow</a> reach out to us as to when all the materials are going to be delivered to all teachers, not just regular ed, but special education, as well as EL teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5153.668s">Because</a> I have talked to a few people, and from what I'm hearing, the teachers should have two kits. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5160.713s">I</a> think there's two different kits that they're working from. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5164.836s">And</a> the consumables should be replaced yearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5170.276s">And</a> in those consumables, there are a lot of things like colored paper, tracing paper, bingo tabs, playing cards, whiteboards, colored pencils, and measuring cups. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5183.161s">Because</a> I look through the programs to see, and there's a long list of things that teachers need. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5191.024s">What</a> is missing? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5192.485s">What</a> are they waiting for? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5194.065s">And</a> how long will they be waiting are a few of my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5199.33s">And</a> this seems like it's a very, from what I've reviewed, looked like a very language-based math program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5206.459s">And</a> what are we doing to help our students that aren't reading at grade level and helping them to access this as well as our <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5218.937s">non-English</a> first language students that may have trouble with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5223.999s">Not</a> only are they having trouble possibly with the math piece, but if they can't get the language, they can't do the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5230.061s">And</a> I'm sure that gets frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5232.001s">So,</a> um... Ms. DiBenedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5233.602s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5256.993s">So</a> do those co-teachers have books and have access to the programming that they need in order to provide additional supports to these students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5305.396s">And</a> do the teachers have the consumables necessary to do lessons with the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5311.119s">Because</a> I hear from you and from teachers that they don't have what they need to, at this point, <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5320.953s">pull</a> out those specific lessons from the programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5324.937s">And</a> we are three weeks in. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5326.358s">I'd</a> like to know when, either from you or from the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5557.935s">My</a> concern is more for consumable and non-consumable. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5561.398s">The</a> list that I have right here for sixth grade, the consumables, yes, they are easy to add, easy to pick up things. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5570.767s">Doc</a> stickers, power <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5572.742s">drink</a> mix, colored pencil, masking tape, index cards, sticky notes, glue sticks, paper cups, food coloring. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5579.323s">Those</a> things you can bring from home or whatever, but I'm just wondering if we're expecting teachers to do that annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5586.145s">And</a> non-consumable items that we should have, do we have measuring tapes, cups and spoons? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5592.966s">Do</a> we have wooden and plastic cubes for them to be using? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5596.127s">Do</a> they have the 10 base blocks, the cinders, the meter sticks, the digital scale, the scissors, the snap cubes, the tape, the bingo chips, the playing cards, the whiteboards? <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5607.137s">There</a> are many, many items for these non-consumables. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5610.64s">And</a> not only do we need them in the regular ed students' hands, we need them in every classroom that is teaching this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5618.166s">I</a> want to make sure if we're hitting a program, we're up and running day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5622.57s">Teachers</a> have what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5624.187s">Education</a> is starting. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5625.607s">We're</a> not waiting for deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5628.708s">We</a> knew we voted for this early last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5631.548s">I</a> don't get why we're still waiting for supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5634.909s">I</a> want to make sure that our teachers have the materials to teach it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5638.83s">Math</a> is a focus for this district this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5641.91s">I</a> want to be successful in saying we bought the best program and we can prove it because we started off right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5650.432s">Let's</a> get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5652.096s">for</a> your sake, for our children's sake, for our teachers' sake, that's all I'm employing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5658.219s">We</a> need to be ready, day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5661.361s">And</a> we need to fix this as if this is not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5664.782s">So</a> I would like an update at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5667.784s">I</a> would like a list of what teachers have, everything that's recommended, and what they're missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5674.047s">For</a> all teachers, not just regular ed classrooms, I want to know how many books, who's missing what, who needs stuff, and how much money it's going to cost to get it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5682.315s">that</a> we didn't provide enough funds for. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5684.596s">Because</a> this is a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5686.456s">And</a> I know you've been working very hard, and I applaud you for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5690.337s">But</a> you can't do it by yourself, and I want to stand up and help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5693.458s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=5693.958s">So</a> I make a motion for it to come before us again with that list.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7085.982s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7087.983s">Diane,</a> thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7090.126s">And</a> thank you for making sure that all students K through 12 will get the screenings, not only to you, but to the district as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7098.21s">All</a> of us were very happy to see this come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7102.972s">I</a> also want to know what our next steps are going to be as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7107.155s">Once</a> we identify students' needs and how we're going to work with them to close that reading gap so that way they are meeting all reading
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7121.255s">Yeah,</a> benchmarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7121.996s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7122.536s">My</a> brain is tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7123.777s">Sorry</a> So I just like to know like what our next steps as a district are <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7130.478s">And</a> I also heard last time that there was a dyslexia committee and if we were going to open that up to parents and when, how that will look and what will that look forward to?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7188.678s">And</a> I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7189.559s">I</a> think we've done a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7191.381s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7191.701s">It's</a> clear that that the groundwork is here, but we need a plan for the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7196.425s">Like,</a> so once we're, our children are identified, maybe we could have some conversations, um, from now till Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7203.551s">So</a> that way, as children are identified, we have a plan to move them forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7231.232s">Right,</a> because in your quote, it says right there that it says you either are identified as needing supports or in interventions or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7243.015s">And</a> I just want to know what our plan for interventions are once children are identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7248.496s">So</a> I know you won't have this answer now. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7250.736s">Maybe</a> this is a future question, but let's have those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7255.138s">I</a> don't know if it should go into the <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7257.591s">curriculum</a> subcommittee and just have some ideas and brainstorming. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7261.717s">So</a> as a district, what we can put in place to help move these students forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7267.087s">and</a> to make sure that those benchmarks are made and that we make progress for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7272.829s">I</a> also wanted to know when the district's MCAS scores are going to be released, and I wanted to follow up on students that, you know, weren't doing well a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7284.774s">I</a> still want to make sure that those students' growth has caught up and is moving forward and that we're not losing any <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7295.794s">reading</a> skills or ELA abilities in any specific grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7302.097s">Like</a> we looked at that a few years ago and I'd like to look at that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7306.36s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7307.26s">I</a> know those, that they're not common knowledge yet and I know it will be soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7312.203s">So</a> maybe we could convene a curriculum subcommittee meeting sometime mid to late October. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7319.167s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=7321.803s">Thank</a> you for all your work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8125.629s">That</a> summer program, is there any way to make sure that we can offer that every year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8163.939s">It</a> looked like it was a lot of fun had by everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8167.742s">And</a> I think the forward thinking of bringing in <a href="https://youtu.be/35_tTrt91mM&t=8171.989s">Students</a> from Leslie is is a great plus for our community because we don't have to pay them they get x Experience and we get expertise to choose from when we do need to replace our retiring best teachers Thank you Thank you<h2><a href="../2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU/2019-09-11_OQKxfahlemU.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 9, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=284.958s">On</a> the next page, 8 of 17, I had a question regarding school, a third of the way down, under Trotter-Richard, $290.12 school committee superintendent's dues.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=314.06s">expenses</a> Okay, I know that mr.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1357.258s">Could</a> we invite Joseph Farah to come <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1361.345s">and</a> give him a commendation for his work and his accomplishment and bring him back into the Medford fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1370.09s">I</a> know his family very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1371.491s">His</a> brother is also a Medford High School student. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1376.034s">The</a> whole family has <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1378.155s">has</a> excelled in science throughout their career. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1381.497s">One</a> of their children graduated with my daughter, Una, and they're a remarkable family. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1386.739s">And</a> if we could do some type of presentation for him and bring him back and show all of MedFed how proud we are of our students that step out, because if he's at UMass Boston, he's around, and I think his family would love something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1400.766s">We</a> need to celebrate what's happening in MedFed in a big way. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=1404.768s">We</a> can definitely do that.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2176.602s">And</a> how much access to a facility will <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2180.341s">your</a> group have?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2198.338s">You</a> bring in porta-potties so you don't have to enter the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2200.74s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2201.14s">and</a> the building's secure and locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2203.201s">That's</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2204.743s">I</a> just worry a little bit about security.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2219.853s">And</a> prep and cleanup will be done by your group?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2224.236s">I</a> still have a few more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2226.615s">So</a> all of those seem very favorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2230.198s">And</a> I know that you're applying for a liquor license on the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2232.879s">I</a> just want to make sure that there's nothing left over. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2235.401s">It</a> is a school grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2238.003s">I</a> just want to make sure someone walks around.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2254.945s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2255.966s">I</a> had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2257.127s">Do</a> they register through community schools so we know who's using our facilities for liability purposes? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2264.612s">Not</a> so much for you through the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2267.554s">You</a> know how they have to apply to use any facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2270.136s">I</a> just want to make sure that that paperwork's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2272.397s">and</a> those applications in that format are logged in so that way we know what time they're coming, what time they're leaving, what the name of the group, who the responsible person is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2282.105s">If</a> there's an issue, we have a contact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2284.327s">Any</a> group, even if we donate any part of any of our schools, should be filling that out just so if something were to happen or found later, we can have someone <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2294.737s">We</a> have the documentation to reach out correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2297.981s">So</a> I just want to make sure that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2301.084s">And</a> I don't see any reason for this not to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2304.468s">My</a> other question is, do we rent that facility to a church on Sundays? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2308.313s">And</a> how is the parking going to interact? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2311.276s">Because</a> I think they have a service.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2325.766s">And</a> have we notified them that this will be happening in the timing, so that way, you know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2336.054s">Because</a> I know that other people in the community have asked to do road races and use that area, and timing has been an issue, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2344.36s">that</a> their service is either 11.30 or 12, I'm not positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2349.769s">So</a> as long as the timing is worked out, it's just something that has to be followed up on because we have steady renters and we just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2358.099s">that</a> it works and it's safe parking and people are only parking where it's appropriate, not on the field, out and back where the kids practice football. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2367.607s">If</a> all those concessions are put in place, especially logging in and noting that it can be free but it has to be logged that you're using the facility and who the contact people are and people are there in place, I have no problem with it and I make a motion to second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2510.08s">When</a> I was at the cardboard canoe races, I thought of a really good idea, like the school committee and the city council should each make a canoe next year and participate in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2522.047s">I</a> thought it would be a lot of fun for the kids to see and the community as a whole, and we should join in on the fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2528.01s">So</a> I don't know if my colleagues are interested, but I thought it might be something we should plan for the beginning of next year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2769.703s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2774.546s">It's</a> not on, Erin? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2777.367s">Is</a> it on? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2778.992s">Yeah,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2780.432s">Over</a> the summer, I know that there's a strong group here in works all summer through, and it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.233s">Thank</a> you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2787.813s">So</a> that when the kids come back and the teachers come back, you're ready for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2791.994s">I</a> just have a few questions about some items that you talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2795.575s">How</a> are our administrators evaluated? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2798.035s">And</a> are they evaluated annually in a similar format to the teachers?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2846.802s">And</a> your evaluations are done by the superintendent on an annual basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2851.626s">For</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2852.587s">For</a> top administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2853.949s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2854.729s">And</a> that's done annually in a similar rubric? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.051s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2857.592s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2858.392s">I</a> just want to make sure we do it fairly for the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2864.004s">I</a> had a few questions about specific, I got a note from a parent regarding the dyslexic reading committee and how parents might be able to join that committee.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2888.555s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2889.295s">Also,</a> you know, there was still some, <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2894.025s">some</a> questions about evidence-based programming, but I'll speak with them directly about that, or maybe when we get after the training and you do an update to us about the training.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2924.501s">And</a> how about the dyslexia evaluation? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2928.023s">Are</a> those currently happening on our new kindergartners? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2931.486s">Do</a> we purchase that? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2933.207s">that</a> program, remember last year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2954.871s">MAPS</a> Growth?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2971.889s">I</a> just, after the conversations we had last year, I thought we were implementing an evaluation for incoming kindergartners this year to evaluate where they were with dyslexia. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2983.415s">And</a> then we were going to take that until DESE provided us more information at the end of this year for the following years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=2992.068s">Did</a> that, that did not happen?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3004.092s">But</a> this committee voted to move forward and it was between a checklist that teacher observed and checked off or an actual assessment that assessed the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3017.682s">is</a> my memory and I thought we were moving forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3020.705s">I'd</a> like to go back and if we're not, I think we need to relook at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3023.667s">I</a> actually thought it was in the budget for this year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3027.51s">So</a> maybe the superintendent could put it on the agenda for next week and we can like talk before that next meeting and we could talk about that and make sure that we're all clear about what's happening with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3040.061s">And</a> my last item is the new math program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3043.703s">I</a> did get some calls about that and I was a little I reached out to the superintendent about making sure El in special education teachers had a teaching book and I think that's happening, but I just want to make sure that the colored paper that the teachers need to <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3063.815s">to</a> operate this, and the manipulatives are available to all our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3069.199s">So</a> I would request that we put this on the agenda and have the director come forward and see how it's going so far, see if we have enough money to sustain us for all those new needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3083.017s">and</a> the paper volume, and just maybe an update on how it's going since it's a brand new program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3089.101s">And</a> I would also suggest have an update from Rocco as well on the new science program. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3094.845s">I</a> know that he gets a lot of things in the mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3097.587s">And</a> I haven't heard anything from anyone about that, but I'd love to celebrate that as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3106.834s">Oh,</a> perfect timing then. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3107.934s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3109.462s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3111.048s">Again,</a> thank you for all the work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3113.255s">I</a> know it's been a tremendous.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3417.518s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3418.69s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3420.09s">I</a> do remember that us being hesitant to buy something, but most of the programs that you're going to buy, you're going to use them for the kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3429.494s">And</a> that's why we weren't going to wait for DESE to make their decision, because we as a committee felt it was too important. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3437.731s">to</a> move forward and then we'll alter it as we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3442.373s">But</a> my understanding was every kindergartner at this grade, at this year, was going to be tested and we weren't waiting because we don't want, that was a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=3454.017s">So</a> when you come forward, just please keep that in mind.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4703.951s">Um,</a> thank you for the update on the CPA requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4707.652s">I</a> was going to ask that, um, John, thank you for you and your team for all the work that you do, not only through the summer, but through the whole year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4714.894s">It's</a> greatly appreciated.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4724.157s">So</a> now that I have you smiling, can we get all the rugs cleaned in all the classrooms at all the schools and not just the Brook?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4737.339s">Especially</a> the kindergarten rugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4739.64s">We've</a> heard over the years how important that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4742.16s">And</a> if we're doing it for one school, they probably all need them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.221s">Without</a> a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4746.841s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4747.021s">So</a> that's an easy one. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4748.922s">We'll</a> get you saying yes to things.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4756.333s">The</a> Curtis Tufts, can we get our friends to come in over the holidays and over the breaks to continue the painting that happened?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4770.921s">And</a> that would be great if we could finish painting that building and spruce that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4776.204s">So</a> since we're not doing the stairs there, I'm sure there are a lot of needs in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4781.848s">Can</a> we allocate those funds that were for the front stairs to something else in that building? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4786.991s">Because</a> there are a lot of needs there and sometimes that building's forgotten.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4793.84s">I</a> just want to make sure that building is cared for well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4827.485s">Yeah,</a> in general, though, that school is looking very worn, and it's a face of Medford, and it needs some help. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4835.934s">It</a> needs some Medford Mustang banners. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4838.777s">It</a> needs some pizazz. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4840.279s">You</a> painted the sign out front, and you keep it very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4843.563s">Maybe</a> some more plantings. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4845.565s">It</a> needs attention as well as the other buildings in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4848.808s">And</a> actually, that's really at the beginning of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4852.834s">It's</a> the face, the welcome of MedFed, and it should stand out that it's part of our public school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4858.342s">So</a> I would really recommend some more love and care given to our Tufts, and I'm always gonna advocate for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4866.028s">You</a> know, they got the new shades, the floors are getting done, and they look beautiful when they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4874.983s">I</a> know you've done them, and I know it's a lot of labor to do that, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4881.364s">And</a> I appreciate all the years that the last few years really updates have been happening in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4886.828s">I'd</a> just like to continue that and make sure that that school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4903.072s">I</a> have two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4904.393s">The</a> first is the more moisture issue at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4907.554s">Is</a> it in an office that's currently occupied? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4910.036s">And</a> if, uh, is it safe? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4911.877s">That's,</a> that's my question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4916.159s">And</a> it's, it's not in the area where children are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4970.19s">Okay</a> in the inside Area will be cleaned up in yeah, we're gonna be taking out parts of walls and replacing them and <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4978.158s">And</a> it's contained to that one little area. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4980.559s">Exactly,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4985.602s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure it's safe.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4989.063s">And</a> I'm sure you do too. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4990.484s">And</a> then my last one is could we get an update on the curbing and all of that that happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=4997.542s">Was</a> that under you, or was that DPW?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5069.154s">So</a> when we last left our meeting, I thought we were getting that machine in that does the cement.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5104.739s">I</a> mean, we all know how busy they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5107.66s">So</a> did all schools get the granite curbing that needed them?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5130.019s">First</a> of all, however it happened, I'm sure it was much more expensive, but it was a great need for the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5138.806s">I</a> appreciate it being done, as well as many teachers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5156.824s">And</a> I'm just glad that that was done in a way that it's going to be done for many years and not have to just keep revisiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5164.208s">I'm</a> sure that was a greater expense, and I'm not sure where those funds came from, but I'm glad you found them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5171.772s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5172.713s">And</a> I know a lot of work went into it over the summer, and it's appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5176.995s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5178.276s">Thank</a> you again.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5877.465s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5878.525s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5879.325s">If</a> we're requesting the data on charter schools, we should also include private and parochial schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5887.087s">Because</a> if the drop off is between ninth and 10th grade, it could be an MCAS issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5892.089s">And</a> we want to make sure that it's still our children if we're educating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5901.211s">Whether</a> or not it's our dollars, it's still our.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5909.256s">Oh,</a> well, kids that don't want to take MCAS when they go to parochial private schools, they're not held to that standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5918.539s">So</a> I want to know if students are leaving Method High for that reason as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5924.04s">It's</a> just as important that we make sure we're educating them and feeling confident so that they don't feel like they have to leave for those reasons as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5945.223s">All</a> of them?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5947.145s">If</a> we have reasons while people withdraw, if you get the reasoning, if they're going to, like you, when people withdraw, you have to report to the Department of Education the reason whether they're forwarding to a <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5960.052s">another</a> public school district, if they're going to a charter school, if they're going to private, or any way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=5968.499s">And</a> just for our own information, because if ninth graders are feeling like they're not comfortable passing that, and parents are moving them, we want to know that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6573.193s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6574.354s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6575.254s">I</a> had some questions and I'm not sure you'll have the answers to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6579.056s">It</a> was about the summer fun camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6581.538s">Last</a> year we worked hand in hand at the special education subcommittee to make sure that the staff was trained to and had paperwork ready for all students with any needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6596.7s">So</a> that they would be met and I was also curious about having did the price increase in the summer fun camp affect enrollment in any way and if we provided it more families with Vouchers or scholarships to help them through that So maybe you could just get back to us on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OQKxfahlemU&t=6623.819s">I</a> <h2><a href="../2019-06-26_9OsqmilNK4I/2019-06-26_9OsqmilNK4I.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 24, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=495.283s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=496.363s">As</a> usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=498.744s">So,</a> on page 2 of 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=505.88s">About</a> almost halfway down, Erzner, first name Eric, $107.82. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=512.341s">It</a> says pending classification.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=549.318s">Yeah,</a> we just don't usually see that pending classification notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=555.199s">OK,</a> so the next one is on page 8 of 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=560.481s">And</a> it might be the second grouping of second packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=573.704s">It</a> says legal services for $3,000 more than halfway down. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=580.666s">Judith</a> Impatori? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=583.007s">Yes,</a> that's under the IDEA grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=586.067s">And</a> we couldn't use in-house legal services? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=593.57s">It's</a> specific for special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=595.47s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=601.494s">That</a> is all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=603.276s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=603.957s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=648.517s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=650.118s">So</a> we had a Special Education Subcommittee meeting on May 28 of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=654.7s">And</a> we talked further about the two issues, two items that we have been working on throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=663.585s">The</a> first is disability awareness program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=665.666s">And</a> the second is out of school time programming for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=670.589s">So,</a> in it, we had many people in attendance, committee members, Paulette Van der Kloot, Paul Rousseau, we had the CPAC coordinators, co-chairs rather, and we talked a little bit about the new PD program that was given to district teachers where disability awareness was infused with the existing curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=694.065s">And</a> Teachers Wrote Inclusive Curriculum in an Impactful Presentation was given by Melanie McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=700.452s">For</a> the first of these six classes, approximately 45 teachers attended this programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=707.48s">It</a> went extremely well and was very well received by <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=712.185s">the</a> professionals in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=715.949s">We</a> went further on to talk about our OST, which is something I call it, is out of school time programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=721.996s">That</a> would be before and after school programming, summer programming, and camps that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=729.683s">Inclusive</a> and welcoming wording was added to the summer fun camp and before and after school handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=736.486s">The</a> summer fun camp staff are hired and ready to go and inclusive training will occur prior to the first week of camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=743.85s">Before</a> and after school programs were not fully staffed at the end of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=748.972s">They</a> reached out to returning college students coming back home and tried to fill the gaps with those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=761.377s">Enrollment</a> for next year, for the after school, <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=765.279s">Program</a> is there is a long wait list at multiple schools inclusive training will begin Be given to all of those new team members prior to the beginning of the school year and we ended this meeting with the goodbye celebration for Kathy Medaglio and thanking her for all her years of service to the method public school community and <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=787.382s">She's</a> been a wonderful director of student services, and we've been very lucky to have her serving our students in our community for all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=799.171s">And</a> she's sitting here this evening, so again, I want to thank her.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=959.311s">I</a> have actually two questions regarding this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=962.412s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=963.212s">on</a> page three, towards the bottom, section six. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=967.235s">It</a> says, any Method resident in attendance may be given permission to speak once at the school committee meetings regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=978.624s">It</a> just makes it sound like a resident can only come to the mic and speak once throughout the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=984.889s">The</a> wording of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=987.631s">Yes,</a> go ahead.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1004.514s">Great,</a> just looking for clarification there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1006.596s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1007.036s">And</a> my second question isn't on the next page, four out of 15, section eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1011.82s">Section</a> eight, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1013.622s">Group</a> committee members who wish to place items on the agenda will provide written notice to the chairperson by Monday noon prior to the scheduled meeting or at the discretion of the chairperson based on extenuating circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1027.717s">So</a> I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1028.918s">Does</a> a chairperson get to decline any item brought forward by a member to be put on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1035.56s">Because</a> that happened to me last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1038.642s">I</a> wanted an item added to the agenda and the chairperson executed their right not to put it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1045.805s">And</a> I would like that addressed in this policy.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1097.561s">I</a> would like to see a change where the chairperson does not have the right to put a member's item on the agenda, only because as elected officials, we're here to voice for the community, and I think that a chairperson <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1114.349s">having</a> that override really prevents you from doing your due diligence as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1121.972s">So</a> I am requesting that that be added to this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1223.66s">All</a> right, well, I can just, I accept that that's the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1230.105s">I</a> also feel like it's a little bit of censorship as a, that one person from our committee gets to decide whether or not something is discussed on any given week. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1243.394s">So,</a> I object to that, but I'm happy with moving forward with this at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1250.7s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=1274.253s">As</a> you are aware, Medford Public Schools ended classes on Thursday, June 13th.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2529.815s">Do</a> you want to go back to your?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2781.663s">Thank</a> you for your work on this is this the same program as breakfast after the bell or is that a different program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2831.815s">Do</a> we look into the Breakfast After the Bell and the grant opportunity of $10,000 per school that signs up for the Breakfast After the Bell program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2844.745s">I</a> know, I'm asking if you looked at both programs and made an informed decision between the two.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2874.476s">No,</a> I'm happy that you're presenting us with an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2877.658s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that we were taking <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2880.699s">Every</a> opportunity given to us when a private group approached a committee member with an opportunity to write the grants for us, for us to receive $10,000 per school to do a startup. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2893.384s">I</a> just wanted to make sure we looked at that as well as this program and picked the right program that we can sustain long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2900.047s">And</a> if we're just picking one and not looking at all options, I want to make sure that all students are fed for indefinitely, not just a pilot program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2917.094s">It's</a> a non-profit programming that helps many school districts throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide at no cost to them, and they don't gain anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2929.978s">It's</a> a public service that they provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2933.119s">And</a> they do it in the most needy of areas throughout the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2938.222s">And</a> they graciously offered to help MedFed write the grant, actually write them for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2945.466s">And</a> I just want to make sure that we're looking at every option available to us so that we have the correct program that we can sustain throughout the whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2954.554s">The</a> future of Medford Public Schools, I just want to feed hungry kids, but I want to do it in a way that it doesn't have to stop in December because it's costing us too much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=2963.738s">I</a> just want to make sure we do our due diligence and do it once, do it right, and make sure we did our homework.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4287.942s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4290.803s">It's</a> not on the agenda.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9OsqmilNK4I&t=4293.504s">Motion</a> to approve.<h2><a href="../2019-06-05_q-Y9QUDQ70c/2019-06-05_q-Y9QUDQ70c.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 3, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=578.846s">I</a> just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=583.07s">See?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=585.332s">Mic</a> tags. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=586.233s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=586.833s">So</a> on page 1 of 23, the second one from the bottom, Boston Public Schools for $2,222, guidance, contracted services, <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=598.185s">Do</a> we contract with Boston Public Schools?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=610.393s">Thank</a> you, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=611.694s">On</a> page two, there's a few guys, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=616.117s">On</a> page two, about 10 up from the bottom, Groundmasters Corp, $5,025, building operators, I was just wondering,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=634.807s">Do</a> we outsource some of that work, the groundmaster? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=638.269s">They</a> are a contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=639.65s">Okay,</a> what kind of, do they do specific stuff that our in-house don't do any of the grounds? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=645.033s">I</a> know I see them up at the high school growing lawn.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=653.359s">Further</a> down on that page, for $50,000 to Robert W. Arvine and Sons, contracted services. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=661.804s">That</a> just seemed like a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=663.085s">I</a> just thought I'd ask.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=671.81s">Oh,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=673.071s">I</a> just like to know different stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=674.892s">I'm</a> nosy. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=676.033s">OK,</a> next page. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=678.194s">Just</a> about six or seven down. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=683.357s">Fringe</a> benefits from method retirement system. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=686.518s">What</a> are fringe benefits?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=699.924s">And</a> I think I only have one more, Christine. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=702.925s">And</a> it's on page 9 of 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=709.137s">It's</a> the one I always ask you about, miscellaneous charges, but it looks like it's a lot of money for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=714.522s">It</a> says Medford High miscellaneous charges is $35,266. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=716.684s">Student</a> activities, the prom. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=722.543s">Okay,</a> I'm just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=724.264s">I</a> just like to know what those big line sums are because I forget from time to time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=757.856s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1294.416s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1294.956s">I</a> want to congratulate Albert. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1296.417s">I've</a> known him for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1298.278s">His</a> older sister was also wonderful in science, as was his older brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1303.74s">We</a> have seen them come before us for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1307.422s">And</a> we still have one more year left to go, so I can't wait to see what that's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1312.524s">Secondly,</a> I also want to comment on having those new science labs and opening up opportunities not only for our vocational students, but our <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1322.496s">high</a> school students and bringing Tufts down and partnering with them and it really opens up so much for students in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1332.119s">I</a> know myself as when my daughter was a junior, she was able to go to the Broad and work in the organic chemistry lab and that opened up doors for her actually through today. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1342.301s">So</a> Method has amazing programming and kids do wonderful work and <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1348.693s">I</a> don't know, but I see rocket science from Albert. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1352.054s">I</a> think I've always seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1353.675s">We've</a> heard that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1355.335s">I</a> can't wait to see what he grows up and does for all of America and us in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1361.717s">So</a> our future is great because of students like that, and because of the educators who devote their lives and times to make sure our students have all those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1370.78s">So</a> thank you to them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1760.02s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1760.94s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1762.141s">I</a> see a lot of English Portuguese. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1765.742s">We</a> don't offer Portuguese as an AP class at Medford High, do we? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1770.744s">That's</a> my understanding.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1838.05s">So,</a> Mayor Burke, that's what stood out to me because I knew we didn't have Portuguese as a class <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1845.497s">at</a> MedFed High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1847.078s">I</a> know we have a large population of Portuguese people moving into MedFed in that it might be an opportunity to add that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1857.724s">But</a> also, just even maybe working with that ESL director to encourage more of our students that have been in the ESL program to initiate and to feel proud and strength and show them your native language <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1875.376s">you</a> can still take that with you and not lose it while you're here and it can be celebrated through these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1885.127s">I'm</a> hoping to see more of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1925.721s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=1926.161s">Thank</a> you for your time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2078.635s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, can you just clarify the total cost of the trip? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2083.48s">Insurance,</a> I want to make sure you understand that insurance is not an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2087.104s">It</a> has to be included in the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2089.546s">We</a> made that motion many years ago when we had to cancel a trip abruptly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2159.668s">So</a> the $2,100 is for the ground tours and the hotels and all of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2165.149s">Does</a> that include the flight? <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2167.289s">It</a> includes the flight. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2169.51s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2170.19s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2170.71s">So</a> that's for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2172.09s">And</a> how are chaperones chosen?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2186.434s">And</a> then... How much do chaperones pay?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2213.749s">In</a> the language as well, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2486.376s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2487.797s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2488.778s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2489.198s">I</a> wanted to say welcome to MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2490.96s">I</a> had the opportunity of meeting you at a subcommittee meeting for personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2497.985s">I</a> enjoyed meeting you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2499.246s">I</a> think that your talents will be greatly used here in MedFed and welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2505.351s">I</a> motion to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2675.619s">Mayor</a> Burke, I love our food policy and how we make sure that when kids are in line, they're not stigmatized if they don't have money and that we're going to continue to give them a lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2688.087s">I</a> just don't want, I know they can't take other items, they can just take a general lunch and like money isn't discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2696.87s">at</a> that point when their friends are in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2699.492s">I</a> just wanted to reiterate that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2702.635s">It's</a> a very important point. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2704.296s">I</a> also wanted to talk, actually a community member texted me this morning with an offer to help us write a grant for $10,000 per school for Breakfast After the Bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2717.567s">So</a> I would like to connect that person to our superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2725.193s">and</a> our superintendent in charge of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2727.854s">And</a> see, I know we have it on the books to look into, Breakfast for All, but this is one particular program called Breakfast After the Bell. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2736.959s">This</a> community member runs a group that will provide you someone to help you write the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2744.773s">And</a> it's 10,000 per school, not per district. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2747.855s">So</a> every school in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2749.396s">And</a> I would love to see it all the way from kindergarten through our 12th graders, because our high school students are hungry as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2755.799s">So</a> I wanted to just keep that in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2758.681s">I'll</a> provide the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2760.222s">I</a> think I would love to see if we can get a grant to help us get underway with that initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2767.746s">I</a> know two of our schools get breakfast now. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2770.524s">I</a> would love to see every student have breakfast and have a successful day, because they're not walking into a classroom hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=2778.27s">So</a> just those two comments, and thank you for the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4482.464s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4483.686s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4484.246s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4485.668s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4486.028s">I</a> think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4486.889s">Stone</a> had her hand raised.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4491.697s">You</a> don't usually put your hand up, so I bow.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4614.707s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4615.968s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4617.048s">First</a> of all, throughout this year, I've gotten to see many <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4624.806s">instances</a> where the collaboration between the Special Education Administration and the CPAC have worked together, and it's been really a joy to watch, because a lot of districts don't have that, and we do in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4639.551s">We</a> have an excellent CPAC that's very well organized and trains us in a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4645.833s">I've</a> learned a lot at some of the meetings, and so have so many of our parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4651.874s">I'd</a> love to see an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4653.942s">in</a> your enrollment and participation in those programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4657.743s">So</a> in any way that the district can help facilitate that, either with the auto call or some ways, I would love to see that as a goal for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4668.506s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4669.166s">As</a> a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4671.587s">And</a> any way that we can enlighten more parents and more families to your programming and to these opportunities to learn more in order to help their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4683.31s">is</a> also a benefit to all throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4687.031s">I've</a> also had the opportunity to chair the special education subcommittee meeting that is a new subcommittee that we formed about a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4695.912s">And</a> I want to thank my colleagues for coming to all those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4699.393s">I</a> tried to provide good snacks and keep it to the correct time frame and really just <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4709.362s">make</a> sure we didn't ask for 20 things when we could ask for two and really facilitate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4715.425s">And</a> I feel like moving forward, if you work on two basic things, three are tops, you make effective change and that change sustains for years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4727.591s">So</a> I would make that recommendation to the CPAC as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4730.952s">I</a> know there's 50 things that you can think of that the district could improve because we all want the best for our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4737.285s">But</a> we really need to focus and plan for next year and see what those items are going to be with the superintendent as well as our new special education director. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4749.093s">I</a> also want to take this opportunity, because it is the last meeting of the year, to call up Kathy Medaglio for a minute, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4756.858s">Oh,</a> when you're finished.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=4941.341s">Yeah,</a> come on over, come on over.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5007.573s">Mayor</a> Burke, if it's okay.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5011.115s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5013.356s">So</a> I know we have another meeting on June 17th, but this is the last meeting where, you know, parents in the district may be watching because their kids will be out of school for the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5023.942s">So</a> I just personally, I've worked as a school committee member for eight years now, and I work in special education in my day job. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5031.811s">So</a> I just want to say how much respect I have, in admiration for Kathy Medaglio. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5036.633s">I</a> know she's retiring this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5040.074s">I</a> just wanted to say what a pleasure it's been to work with you on so many issues for so many families. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5047.577s">You've</a> been an excellent SPED director. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5049.378s">Not</a> only do you pass all of our coordinated program reviews with flying colors, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5055.267s">a</a> really great accomplishment for a school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5058.67s">You</a> also work with compassion, and you keep what's best for the children in the district at the forefront, mostly the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5067.056s">I</a> can't tell you how much respect I have for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5071.379s">Thank</a> you for your years of service in MedFed, and you will always hear from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/q-Y9QUDQ70c&t=5076.563s">I</a> don't know if that's a good thing or a threat.<h2><a href="../2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E/2019-05-22_R-JcMFRQo7E.html">School Committee meeting May 20, 2019</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=323.258s">Mayor</a> Burke, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=329.92s">There</a> was, sorry, I'm saying hi to all our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=335.881s">On</a> page three or four, I had a question under trustees of Boston College. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=341.783s">Is</a> that outside special education tuition, or what type of tuition is that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1082.754s">I</a> second Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1084.394s">Van</a> der Kloot's motion and I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1086.99s">that</a> time has changed, awareness has changed, and we need to look at other resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1095.136s">So</a> I second Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1096.377s">Van</a> der Kloot's motion and ask for a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=1100.54s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3116.511s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, you talked about the decrease in the science curriculum, and this year we have just adopted a new science curriculum, so we're hoping to see growth in the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3129.763s">Usually</a> when you adopt a program like our ELA or our math program, which we've gotten, which we got in the last few years, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3138.557s">It</a> takes an average of three years to see any progress on an MCAS or a standardized test because it takes years of instruction for the students to learn the new vocabulary and move forward in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3154.709s">So</a> even though we got our programming early and we're starting a little early with training, we'll see that in the next few years with science. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3165.976s">And</a> we should be seeing that in the English language arts program, because we did invest about four years ago in a new ELA program. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3174.583s">And</a> we should see that growth among all subgroups because of that programming, because students have had it for consecutive years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3182.57s">And</a> as they grow up, and if we don't, then we have to realize that maybe that's not the right program. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3189.095s">So</a> that's a good way to look at what our curriculum is and make <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3193.479s">good</a> choices going forward, and I applaud you for coming forward and advocating for the students in your school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3200.985s">We</a> need to see more of that here at school committee, and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3206.089s">It's</a> not always easy to go there and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=3208.211s">Thank</a> you for your time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8593.054s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8594.275s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8596.315s">First</a> of all, I want to thank everybody for waiting so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8598.876s">It's</a> been a long night already, and we have a ways to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8602.038s">But</a> I want to talk about enrichment and the opportunities you provide our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8607.2s">Some</a> children learn new things because you're taking time raising money. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8614.143s">They</a> experience things that they wouldn't necessarily experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8619.565s">They</a> get new books and get to read about faraway lands. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8622.866s">The</a> things that you do matter to people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8625.667s">And</a> I just want to really tell you how much, as a school committee member, when you buy books for a library, that touches my heart, because our budget only goes so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8635.751s">So</a> the work you do enriches not only the children's heart, but also helps us as school committee members when we run out of dollars and we wish we could buy those brand new books that everybody's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8648.2s">or</a> send kids to a museum that the school budget just doesn't have the funding for. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8653.442s">So</a> as a member, I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8657.544s">Playgrounds,</a> we saw great work with one of our playgrounds, and that was parent-driven, and that was Cheryl, and well, actually, two playgrounds got improvements this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8670.149s">And</a> we need to move forward with that, and this committee has made that a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8674.511s">Just</a> so you all know, that is on our master plan <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8678.19s">our</a> capital improvement plans, and we do take that seriously, both for safety, both for physical ability for kids, and we want kids to get outside and have time to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8689.472s">It</a> helps the rest of their day, and it helps their learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8692.673s">So</a> just to follow up on that, that that is a committee thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8698.253s">I</a> also wanted to make sure that all of our PTOs, PTGs, are now 5013Cs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8705.335s">I</a> don't know if most of you know me, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8707.517s">but</a> I want everything to be, go through the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8713.319s">I</a> think it's transparent, I think everybody's on the same page, everybody's following the same rules, all the offices are listed, all the bank accounts are there, there's checks and balances, so that's a question I have for this evening to make sure that they're all registered with Medford Public Schools, and when you're raising money, oh, all the, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8736.082s">Right,</a> all the ones, and the city-wide one as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8739.426s">We</a> are not a wide one. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8740.787s">We</a> are just a group of people meeting and fundraising and going back to our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8746.674s">Okay,</a> could you come to the, okay.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8843.793s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8844.574s">As</a> long as that's looked at and there's rules and bylaws and things followed for that grouping that's similar to the other grouping. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8853.68s">And</a> I just want to finish off by saying I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8858.892s">When</a> your children transition into middle school, you step back as a parent, and we are losing an opportunity to keep those parents involved in our district and in our children's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8873.655s">And</a> they're feeling already that their children are more independent, so they have more time to give as their children get bigger and older. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8883.457s">And</a> I would just suggest that we <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=8888.62s">well,</a> that you include the middle school PTOs, especially because it would add value to those students' lives and you have an opportunity to gain help with the citywide program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9006.062s">Just</a> as a follow-up, sorry, and then I'll yield to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9012.246s">A</a> few years ago, you actually helped us develop the online program, so you understand the intent I have for it, be it anybody fundraising, using Method's name, be registered with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9026.211s">So</a> in some way, shape, or form, I would like this group registered, even if it's not as a 5013C, just so that we have it through the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9038.427s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9038.967s">That's</a> my only concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9040.65s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9199.459s">Thank</a> you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9200.119s">Thank</a> you for coming.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9327.374s">Oh,</a> wow, Mia.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9569.681s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9571.002s">I</a> just wanted to say that Joan had an outstanding interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9574.524s">She</a> was prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9575.525s">She</a> knows the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9577.982s">She</a> was well-spoken, she has new innovative ideas, as well as keeping things that we currently have in place going. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9587.047s">I</a> came out very impressed with her through the evening, and she was the clear choice for our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=9594.53s">And</a> I just want to say congratulations.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10426.216s">Right,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10836.193s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10837.353s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10838.954s">So</a> I'm a proponent for breakfast before, after, during, whenever the bell rings. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10846.696s">We</a> all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10849.177s">No</a> student should, no student can focus on reading, math, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10856.423s">anything</a> if they're hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10858.644s">They</a> can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10859.604s">So</a> my question is, how long and how quickly could we do the research necessary so we can begin this for the beginning of next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10869.687s">Just</a> answer some of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10871.527s">And</a> I have one question, is I know that if we're not collecting free and reduced lunch paperwork, that also affects our high school students when they're applying for SAT exams, because they get them <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10885.87s">for</a> less money. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10887.271s">When</a> they apply for colleges, they get reduced rates for their college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10892.335s">So</a> year one, we're doing the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10895.258s">On</a> year two, we still, as a district, have to collect those forms so that way our high school students still receive those benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10904.225s">And</a> I don't want it to be done less important, because it is very important for those kids in order to apply for their colleges and take their <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10914.97s">PSATs</a> and SATs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10916.391s">I</a> know we pay for PSATs now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10918.393s">But</a> those are other issues that we need to see how it affects by not doing that paperwork on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10925.618s">So</a> I'm all for it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10935.806s">I</a> just want to stress the importance that there are reasons to still collect those papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10942.172s">There's</a> things that people don't see in these programs that it also, it continues not just free lunch, free and reduced lunch, it also affects other programming that our students apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=10954.818s">So</a> even though this program says we wouldn't have to collect it, I would still want that data for the district as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11044.334s">So</a> would you be able to provide that report by our next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11047.536s">Absolutely</a> not.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11049.217s">So</a> that's the time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11050.598s">I</a> need to know when would you be able to provide this body with the information so we can move forward for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11057.102s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=11058.6s">I</a> just want to know before we vote on that, if you say, I need till the end of June and before we disperse for the summer, that's great, but if we're going to, I just want to make sure something's in place, that we have all the information, but we still move forward, as my colleague motioned, to make sure our students are fed as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12901.834s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12902.014s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12903.035s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12904.415s">I</a> only have two concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12906.336s">I</a> wholeheartedly believe in research and the data that it can provide both for future treatments of generations of kids <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12916.334s">I</a> also absolutely hate vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12920.275s">And</a> I think that we're going to have major health issues with our 40-year-olds that have started vaping now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12927.337s">And</a> it makes my skin crawl because I'm so worried for this generation of people that are choosing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12935.94s">So</a> I wholeheartedly want to see anything that helps our students succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12941.921s">I</a> want to make sure it doesn't interfere with the academic day. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12945.16s">of</a> our children, because we're here to educate children first, as well as keep them safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12952.481s">But</a> I have two concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12953.962s">One,</a> I don't like passive consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12956.542s">I</a> think there's too many areas of people not seeing that one paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12961.363s">I</a> would like to see signed consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12963.503s">I</a> would like parents to know what their child is in for. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12967.224s">So</a> that's my first concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12969.045s">And</a> I would also like to see student consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12972.525s">because</a> I don't want, I want the students to buy in. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12976.426s">Just</a> from what I heard, that I was taking notes as it was, and we talked about passive consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12982.767s">I</a> had said that in our initial, I mean, our things as well before I came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12988.928s">I</a> just don't believe in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12990.088s">I</a> think there's too many ways that we can lose communication and trust with parents when you do that, and I think that we should have signed consent <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=12998.383s">in</a> this type of a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13000.304s">And</a> really boast what we're trying to do as a community is to change behaviors in our youth and protect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13012.451s">So</a> it has to be like a big campaign that we get by and people are aware of what they're buying in. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13020.156s">So</a> those are my only two concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13022.137s">And</a> when the superintendent's ready to tell us that it won't interfere, <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13027.523s">with</a> programming and she feels that it's the right time to move forward with the vote on this, I respectfully wait for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=13035.238s">And</a> I will motion at that time to move forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14673.729s">So</a> through the mayor to our superintendent, were there any other programs piloted that <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14682.992s">caught</a> in a different way that we didn't have to bump over some bumps the first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14687.573s">Because</a> we haven't had a program in so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14690.213s">To</a> hear concerns is concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14693.394s">And</a> to invest money into a program that has bumps is concerning to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14698.675s">I</a> want all students that's computers aren't working for a week at home to still be able to go home and keep up with the class. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14709.091s">hate</a> to have someone's computer break down and them not to be accessing homework for an evening in middle school and fall behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14715.953s">Because</a> math basics build on each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14718.694s">And</a> that's my only concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14720.875s">I</a> trust that you think that this is the best program, but I'm not sure it's the best for our population.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14826.854s">So</a> I would like to know what the whole financial cost is for us, and I would also like to know if those other districts have the same demographics as ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14837.217s">Is</a> it Arlington, Lexington?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14842.038s">Somerville</a> has... It does, but they also have more money than most districts have. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14846.119s">Somerville</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14846.739s">So</a> they give their students... Yes, Somerville.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=14867.717s">And</a> if it doesn't work in two years, are we going to reassess and provide another alternative?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15438.632s">I'm</a> all, I'm ready to speak.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15444.033s">I</a> do, I've never seen that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15689.127s">Early?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R-JcMFRQo7E&t=15689.668s">Oh,</a> my gosh.<h2><a href="../2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g/2019-05-08_L6pSsRE1l3g.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 6, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2353.877s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2355.158s">I</a> also, I just want to thank the parent for coming forward and putting her face to what we're learning about next. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2363.746s">And</a> her family's story, telling it publicly is not always easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2369.132s">And</a> it helps make it relevant as we learn more and what our next steps should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2377.577s">It</a> puts a picture together for us that what we're working for, and I appreciate you coming forward and sharing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2384.082s">It's</a> very important for us to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2386.965s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2388.586s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=2388.686s">Van</a> der Kloot, did you want to?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4397.52s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4398.561s">Thank</a> you, and thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4401.582s">It</a> sounds like you're working with a lot of different districts, and we want to know how we can get <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4406.894s">you</a> to work with the Medford district, what would be involved in that, what way you see us beginning, how you could walk us through some of the process, maybe come up with some ideas with our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4419.52s">I</a> don't know if there's any grants we can apply for, because this is a new initiative coming out from the state, and how we get expertise like yourself in helping our children in our classrooms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4512.308s">I</a> had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4513.108s">Is</a> it a funded mandate or an unfunded mandate? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4516.331s">Is</a> there grants available?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4520.054s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4521.435s">You</a> know, it's great to have mandates, but we as a committee or a school district have to find ways to fund these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4530.142s">And</a> if there's fundamental changes in how we need to teach reading and literacy to our early readers or early <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4540.714s">beginning</a> people, I think that education is like a foundation of a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4546.377s">If</a> you catch it early and you have a strong foundation, you have a beautiful, strong house for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4552.32s">And</a> I always would love to do that, and I think this is worth investigating further for our district, and I would like to make a motion at this time through the mayor, to the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4566.752s">please</a> investigate and give us some costs involved in bringing either a landmark program, Dr. Gobb, or something similar before us with this budget so that way we can move forward immediately and less families and children have to come before us pleading for help for their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4586.817s">I</a> think this is tremendous, not only for kids with reading deficiencies, but I think how we look at reading fundamentally <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=4596.232s">and</a> not early learners, so I'd like to make that motion at this time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5490.411s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5493.103s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5494.104s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5494.604s">I</a> have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5495.804s">First</a> of all, I'm wondering if the task force next steps, if the task force can contact the Andover Public School, look at what they're currently doing based on the information we received tonight, and see what screenings they're using, how much they're paying for it, like all of those connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5514.054s">I</a> would appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5515.215s">And</a> maybe even reach out to the landmark program and see what they can have to offer us.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5527.174s">And</a> I want to know why the kindergartners aren't being tested until later in the school year, when we know that even testing them before they come would be the best idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5537.638s">So</a> I would like to do that as their kindergarten screenings happen, because we do screen them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5564.482s">Before</a> you answer that, why are we using an assessment that doesn't assess the student's needs, and it just answers questions to the teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5573.388s">I</a> don't want that type of assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5575.222s">I</a> want the assessment so we do it once and we know what the student need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5579.225s">I</a> don't want it to have two steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5582.327s">So</a> speaking on that piece isn't what I really, I don't think is the direction from what I've learned this evening as the future for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5591.634s">But</a> again, I'm not a PhD and I don't know this and I know you guys are the educators and have that information and background. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5600.064s">I</a> just don't want to be redundant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5601.405s">I</a> don't want to answer questions that a teacher just gets an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5604.186s">I</a> want to know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5651.577s">I</a> get your point, Superintendent, and I have great respect for your academic knowledge and base, but the doctor suggested there are eight or nine programs that she could recommend that are available right now, and rather than buy two programs, I would really rather invest our money right into what we need for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5672.551s">I</a> don't know, maybe you both could speak a little bit more on that so I learn more, but that's the direction I see from what I've learned this evening,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5703.399s">But</a> we're buying this right now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5742.88s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5743.864s">My</a> only point is with that, do we know that the cost difference between one of those eight programs and this program is significant?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5770.925s">So</a> I also look at the long-term piece and how, like, if we know early and we can remediate services early, then you need less services long time, and that actually saves us money as a district when you're looking at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5786.968s">So,</a> you know, I'm hesitant for a quick fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5790.449s">I</a> know DESE hasn't made their choices and it's hard to invest in things, but I just don't want to throw $1.07 away per kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5800.787s">in</a> a year's time of intervention that to me is worth the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5806.03s">I</a> don't know if it fits in our budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5838.319s">No,</a> I didn't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5839.96s">But</a> I just felt like the other one, the other assessment would clearly identify like there's four different areas in a child's area <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5848.789s">that</a> needs direction, the other one would identify the right area to work with, with the child, whereas the other one is just a general, oh yeah, you need help, but you don't know where to actually help, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5861.573s">Like,</a> where the weakness is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5864.014s">Well,</a> there'd be more work after. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=5866.155s">Maybe</a> we could just have a cost analysis.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7520.78s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7522.241s">I</a> know this has been a big project and a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7526.683s">But</a> something I noticed when I'm looking at these accounts, there are areas that I don't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7532.486s">I</a> don't see football. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7533.726s">I</a> don't see boys hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7535.067s">We</a> have girls hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7536.548s">I</a> don't see boys baseball or boys soccer, but we have some of the girls teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7542.05s">I</a> just don't know why <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7544.204s">It's</a> like all activity accounts aren't listed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7547.492s">That's</a> more of my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7548.976s">I'm</a> not even sure if you can answer that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7604.004s">So</a> a little bit of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7606.146s">Many</a> years ago, before I was a school committee member, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7610.14s">there</a> was a question with the student activities account, and at that time, I believe, either when I first got on or right before I first got on, and maybe Member Bandicoot can help me with this memory, is that all student activity accounts were supposed to go and be registered through the high school accounts, and all of these should be listed here, and all money's deposited and processed in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7639.289s">I</a> know the Medford High School PTO at that time had their account in that manner because I was on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7654.043s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7685.708s">So</a> does that mean like a lot of the ones that aren't listed here may be under a 5013C or a not? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7695.481s">non-profit</a> group like, you know, the Friends of accounts and aren't those programs, like we made a motion here about two years ago that those accounts also had to register because they're using MedFed's name and MedFed students to raise money and they were supposed to by September 1st, I believe, or October 1st of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7722.082s">be</a> on this list?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7726.504s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7767.526s">Okay,</a> so my last question, and it might be a mix of both. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7770.788s">So</a> say I see on Facebook that a certain group is having a camp up at our community schools through the summer, and it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7780.717s">It</a> has MedFed name on the camp, and they're running it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7785.0s">Does</a> that money go through community schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7787.602s">Does</a> that go through student activities? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7790.384s">I'm</a> just not clear on how we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7794.247s">Or</a> do they just rent space from us, and they get to charge people at the door? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7801.092s">There's</a> no clarity and accountability for how all this money is coming and going, and that's what I'm afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7809.073s">Not</a> that I believe that people are doing something wrong, but when money's passing hands, there is temptation there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7817.338s">And</a> if the school district is, if they're utilizing our buildings, we need to be paid for that, so that way we can provide heat and electric and paper towels and those type of products while they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7829.165s">And</a> we know, for liability's sake as well, who's in our building when, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7834.888s">Are</a> they our employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7836.109s">Are</a> they renting our facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7837.79s">We're</a> liable in a lot of these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7841.032s">Because</a> if someone were to get hurt and we don't know, that's really scary too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7848.317s">So</a> there's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7850.871s">trying</a> to figure out this puzzle piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7852.932s">And</a> that's really what I'm looking for.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7876.902s">Thank</a> you for providing this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7880.264s">Maybe</a> we could make a motion to have, at some point, maybe in the fall, like a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7888.187s">Look</a> at how money is going through community schools, how money goes through student activity accounts, and how money goes through, you know, friends, and what we know about it, and how we want that structured so we make sure that we're following all guidelines and that things are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7907.473s">In</a> a real way, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7909.975s">in</a> what our responsibility is as a school district as far as liability when they're in our building, if they're renting it from us, as opposed to running the group through us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7923.442s">So</a> it's just been involved for a long time and some clarity would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7929.085s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for that for early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7932.546s">And</a> thank you very much for your time in presenting this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7938.089s">I</a> have a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7941.532s">To</a> look at these three different venues, community schools, the friends of, and student activities and how money goes in and out of each and how we're tracking that system, if there's a better way that we need to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7960.605s">And</a> we can send it to a subcommittee or something, but it's just... <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7965.425s">There's</a> a lot of usage in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7967.826s">And</a> there's other things, too, like when we rent our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7972.247s">If</a> a rental is using our building and they're using more space than they're renting, and if they're going into classrooms and taking people's things, or utilizing things that are in the building when they're not supposed to, those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7987.731s">I</a> think we just need to look at this <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=7990.643s">like</a> whole picture of what we're doing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8517.321s">to</a> provide us with that information before the end of the school year, so we can look at different things together, and just look at them and say, how come this group is over here and we have... And I think it would add more clarity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8532.665s">So,</a> instead of making a motion, just a request to have the activities account next to the friends of under the new way that they have to enroll in the friends of, and that information.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8607.582s">So</a> we had a presentation and we have a form that Emily has that groups provide their bank account information, who's running those groups, and information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8620.647s">That's</a> the group I mean.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8638.306s">So</a> you can compare them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8639.146s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8639.266s">How</a> many groups are listed in that right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8641.587s">Do</a> you remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8641.987s">I</a> don't know off the top of my head.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8660.683s">And</a> it's on the calendar to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8662.764s">We</a> just asked that we add the student activities at that point so we can see both that new group that you have listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8670.188s">Because</a> all of those groups need to do that annually <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8674.983s">So</a> they have to do that by September 1st, and you'll have the information to provide to us by October 1st.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8686.972s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8687.252s">That's</a> why we made it October, give it a month to make sure that we could compile the information and present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L6pSsRE1l3g&t=8693.777s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2019-04-22_LRgDo3q--Pg/2019-04-22_LRgDo3q--Pg.html">Medford School Committee April 8, 2019 meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=604.49s">I</a> had a couple questions on <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=608.229s">the</a> set that says vouchers paid March 30th through April 5th on page three of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=620.753s">It's</a> a $600 conference, but we couldn't read what it was, National Association for Educational of, do you have any idea what that conference was for and who attended?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=653.272s">It</a> says unemployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=655.233s">Do</a> we have people currently on the unemployment?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=728.244s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=729.505s">Just</a> a note about the notes at that thank <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=734.73s">So</a> it doesn't reflect a lot of concerns or ideas that were brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=739.093s">It</a> just gives bullet points, I think, a little bit more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=743.396s">I</a> know at that meeting, we would have put more items on the capital improvement plan, but we were hoping to get a grant for the whole high school, and that's why those items weren't on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=755.884s">And</a> concerns raised whether a big <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=761.434s">grant</a> would be funded by the city council was also raised because it would cost the city money to match grant funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=769.964s">So</a> all that type of information, I always look back at these notes, so if they could be included a little bit more, I'd appreciate it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1146.398s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1148.559s">Paulette,</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1150.36s">I</a> think that this is a beginning of a conversation to make not only that building but all areas around our schools better. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1157.242s">I</a> know last summer that <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1159.647s">They</a> did a walk around the outside of all the elementary schools and identified areas that needed to be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1166.47s">And</a> John did an amazing job with his team beautifying a lot of that, those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1173.153s">So,</a> I want to give kudos to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1175.134s">So,</a> it has begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1176.834s">Maybe</a> we need to do that at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1179.856s">But</a> while I was at an event up at the vocational school the other night, <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1188.223s">Chris</a> Donovan outside in the dock with Fritz and our station manager, our community access manager, they were out there putting up spotlights through the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1201.672s">And</a> he has pictures on his Facebook account and I have some on my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1205.775s">Maybe</a> I'll share them so we can add them to the blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1208.337s">They</a> had up lights, blue lights of the whole high school and it looked amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1212.4s">And</a> certain doorways were all lit up blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1215.482s">It</a> transformed the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1217.616s">and</a> they had up lights around the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1220.438s">He</a> also noted that we do have great lighting up there now because it was dark, but it's very harsh lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1227.003s">So</a> maybe he said he might be able to help us get filter over them so it's still bright, but not as prison yard-like, might have been the wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1241.835s">That</a> was one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1242.876s">But</a> it looked amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1244.537s">And</a> just seeing that little difference made a huge difference walking in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1248.919s">And</a> Fame was up there this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1251.46s">They</a> had Fame written on the wall of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1254.862s">It</a> was beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1256.303s">The</a> school looked really, really pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1259.745s">So</a> there's a lot of different ways we can put lipstick on it to make it look prettier. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1268.758s">So</a> I make a motion to, I second, well, I agree with both my colleagues who want to look at this issue and do some beautification. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1278.758s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1345.857s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=1603.206s">Good</a> evening.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2054.866s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2055.006s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2056.668s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2057.129s">I</a> love the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=2058.03s">Is</a> this a one-year project, or will we have the pickup for additional years?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3414.333s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3414.613s">On</a> this? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3415.514s">Yes,</a> this is regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3416.795s">At</a> our meeting last week when we were discussing languages, we asked for a follow-up report on the number of students at each grade level and which languages they currently took and what they were planning on taking for next year so we could help with our budgeting plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3436.72s">So</a> I know that that's not on the back of our questionable... It's in the budget committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3442.664s">Yeah,</a> okay.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3841.288s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3843.069s">So</a> I don't know if it needs to be in a capital improvement plan or added to next year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3849.494s">I</a> don't know which is the better way to do it, because we do have athletic budget that came before us earlier tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3855.617s">So</a> I'm not sure if this warrants a capital plan and a superintendent of finance would be able to address that, whether we should just put it in for next year's budget under the athletics department and not have to go through city council approval and all of that and make sure that we have the funding there to make sure our gymnasts are all set for the day after Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3883.517s">a</a> different way to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3884.698s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3885.378s">Just</a> making sure those funds are available and accessed right away.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3893.421s">Well,</a> that's my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3896.623s">When</a> I asked for this to be put on the agenda, I also asked for the finance piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3900.724s">How</a> much are we actually making from renting out that area of our school? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3905.526s">I</a> don't know if we have those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3907.547s">I</a> got them for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3908.087s">You</a> want them? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3908.968s">Yes,</a> I do.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3939.813s">So</a> are any of those funds reallocated back into the equipment and the maintenance of that area that you're aware of?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3956.461s">But</a> they're clearly raising that money over a few years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=3970.03s">You</a> know, I would move to add this $20,000 to this year's budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4000.239s">So</a> I make a motion to add this $20,000 to the athletic budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4048.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4049.852s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4050.212s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4051.472s">So</a> just to continue, if we're going to be doing the floor, can we look at that room and see if it needs a paint job? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4057.473s">Because</a> you don't want to paint.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4059.574s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4078.32s">Okay,</a> I just figured since we were in there doing this type of scope of work, it's the right time to look at the whole area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4090.744s">And</a> could we just, I know you said you've replaced some equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4095.385s">Could</a> we just check all the equipment at that time, make sure that this program's up and running, and maybe put it on a schedule to make sure that URIs are serviced?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4106.74s">Okay,</a> and so like maybe we keep a list somewhere, like a spreadsheet, like we asked for for other equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4117.527s">It's</a> really good to have for our athletic equipment, so we replace things as of, like this evening when we're putting more money back into <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=4127.055s">the</a> weight room in that area, so that way we don't get fall behind the eight ball and have to replace everything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5468.08s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5469.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5470.161s">First</a> of all, I really liked all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5473.661s">And</a> it's amazing to see all the things that you have done in less than one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5482.264s">It's</a> a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5482.844s">It's</a> a lot of community time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5484.424s">It's</a> a lot of learning for yourself and growth as a superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5491.846s">I</a> have to comment, though, most directly <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5495.174s">is</a> that your ownership of where we actually are and naming where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5500.056s">In</a> order to move forward, we have to acknowledge where we are, our strengths and our weaknesses, and our areas of growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5507.599s">And</a> I respect that and appreciate that in this report and in you as a person as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5515.622s">At</a> this time, I would like to look towards the mayor to talk to her about the beginning, because there's less <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5522.088s">There's</a> between 40 and 45 school days left to this year, this school year, and then we're out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5529.05s">I</a> know 45 school days from today I think is like June 17th, so like we're right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5534.972s">We're</a> right there between 40 and 45. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5537.253s">That's</a> really not a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5540.133s">So</a> as a committee, we're required to do a review of our superintendent, an annual review. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5547.556s">So</a> I'm gonna look to the mayor to start the process so that way we can, <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5552.618s">give</a> feedback of what we've seen for this year, positive, and our future goals for you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5560.543s">And</a> since you brought this forward, I thought it was an appropriate time to start that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/LRgDo3q--Pg&t=5566.126s">So</a> there's a motion to, I don't know if I have to motion or if I just recommend it.<h2><a href="../2019-04-05_dWFoLPiqEXg/2019-04-05_dWFoLPiqEXg.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 1, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=538.121s">We</a> didn't get a hard copy of that, and we usually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=541.103s">I</a> didn't have a chance to look through that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=543.525s">If</a> there's any questions, can I ask them at the next meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=547.508s">Would</a> you like to table it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=549.93s">No,</a> I'm sure they need to be approved to be paid, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=554.654s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=555.935s">Do</a> you need approval tonight to pay those? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=558.196s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=559.397s">And</a> if the, no.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=562.366s">OK,</a> so can we table that so we can just look at them before we?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=583.679s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=583.86s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=584.921s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=585.381s">I'm</a> hoping if there's anybody in the community that needs to speak first, but I've received a few phone calls and emails about a few issues and I'd like to bring them up under this community participation section.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=605.119s">Well,</a> I could at least bring up the ideas that were brought forward to me so we can put them on the agenda for next week and deliberate at that time, so at least they're brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=614.887s">First</a> was a concern about the gymnastic floor, and I'm requesting an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=621.371s">I</a> heard that there was some kind of presentation at the city council meeting last week, and that there was a work order requested for either the floor or some equipment, and that <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=635.198s">Because</a> of what was said at that meeting, the gymnastic room has been closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=641.46s">And</a> we're not using it as a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=644.481s">And</a> community schools aren't using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=646.182s">So</a> the little cute little three-year-olds I see when I go to Zuma on Saturday mornings aren't there and able to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=651.684s">So</a> I'm just wondering if an inspection has been completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=655.125s">It's</a> scheduled for this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=656.665s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=657.246s">And</a> so could we get a follow-up at our next meeting of where we are? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=661.763s">maybe</a> even an email if that's able to open prior to our next meeting, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=669.005s">So</a> I'd like to add that to the next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=671.526s">The</a> other item is, I got a call about using drain fields for our middle school children for softball, and that the field is gonna be permitted to the middle school <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=689.44s">And</a> there might be some conflict with the youth baseball program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=697.311s">If</a> anybody has some information on that, is our middle school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=715.346s">So</a> it's girls youth softball using it, because the information I got today that it was the middle school club or middle school was using it for a youth softball team in that they were permitted the use of it after the youth little league already got permitted for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=736.775s">So</a> if maybe we could get a report from either the middle school teachers or the Hormel commissioner, or whoever, if Bobby Maloney is the person who takes care of the Hormel, or whoever takes care of scheduling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=752.989s">Hormel</a> commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=753.689s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=754.39s">Hormel</a> commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=755.25s">If</a> they could report to us at our next meeting and confirm that it's not through the schools, it's through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=761.336s">The</a> youth programs, just to clarify because I was informed today that it was under <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=769.228s">the</a> middle school program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=787.962s">So</a> could we have the commission come forward and just assure us that or send us a letter saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=794.44s">It</a> has nothing to do with the school district pulling permits for that field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=799.682s">So</a> that's my second request for the item for the agenda for next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=804.825s">And</a> I just was wondering if there were any issues with the traffic due to the bridge closing in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=813.048s">Any</a> updates on how that affected our Columbus school parents and our children on buses getting to and from school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2555.652s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2556.832s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2557.452s">Could</a> you just explain to people how this works for people who are watching from home? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2561.994s">Like,</a> is it an after school program? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2564.334s">How</a> does it affect their day at school? <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2566.64s">how</a> many children, how children are selected, is it to open to all children, you know, regardless of that child's needs, just a little bit more about it, a little bit more basics, so people tuning in tonight that haven't really, are seeing the growth, especially in our elementary schools, get a clearer understanding of what we're offering and what our purpose is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=2832.221s">All</a> right, thank you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3596.904s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3598.405s">Not</a> only do I agree that we've had great successes, and we're seeing more and more of our students in MEDFED, <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3606.245s">take</a> advantage of these learning opportunities both in school and out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3611.089s">We</a> had the CCSR group here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3613.651s">But</a> when it comes down to send these children, there's a lot of pressure on these families and these groups to raise the money to be able to go to these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3622.878s">And</a> I would hate to take anything away from books, pencils, paper that was budgeted for in a different way to help fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3633.087s">And</a> it would be terrible if we <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3635.118s">came</a> down to it and didn't have the funds available for our students to take part in these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3639.961s">So</a> I second what my colleague is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3642.542s">It</a> will be a priority for me throughout the budget process, and it will be one of my top priorities to make sure that every child that gets to that point shouldn't have to worry about how they get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3655.049s">They're</a> representing MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3657.29s">All</a> I want to say is good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3659.231s">Bring</a> home the whole big awards, <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3663.077s">the</a> shiny trophies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3664.357s">Do</a> your best. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3666.538s">And</a> while you're at it, be yourself, because if they see how you are here, if you present that way there, your glow will shine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3683.361s">Give</a> them all the codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3684.442s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dWFoLPiqEXg&t=3723.235s">Motion</a> to approve.<h2><a href="../2019-03-20_MKGa1KK1-VM/2019-03-20_MKGa1KK1-VM.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 18, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3278.718s">Can</a> I waive that report being read and take item number two, report on upcoming MBTA role closures as priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3294.896s">Motion</a> on the floor for suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3296.978s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=3321.758s">I'm</a> not doing mine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4476.16s">I</a> know we spoke the other night at the open house for the Green Line extension and all the road closures. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4482.984s">My</a> concern is with the rerouting of a lot of this traffic is on Main Street and the Columbus School I spoke to you about is a few blocks away from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4493.209s">So</a> I'm worried. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4494.15s">First,</a> we talked about the backup, and I'm glad that you addressed that with Kirstine <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4499.77s">the</a> school buses and our parents being directed so that they can drop off their children in a safe, appropriate way and not get stuck in the commuter traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4509.477s">But</a> my other concern is how many of our students walk to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4514.02s">And</a> I'm not so much concerned on Main Street, it's just those people that go into the back streets to get around the traffic and the frustration level of the drivers in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4524.427s">So</a> I just want maybe an announcement made to our families from the Columbus School <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4529.163s">that</a> this change is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4530.524s">There'll</a> be a traffic change. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4531.905s">Please</a> advise your children to be more aware of cars in the neighborhood, as well as having our police force updated with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4542.171s">I</a> didn't get a chance to talk to the chief the other night regarding this issue, but some of our students do walk in those neighborhoods, especially our fifth graders that may walk by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4552.497s">So</a> I don't want them to come between two cars <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4556.05s">an</a> aggravated driver going long way down the street.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4598.622s">Dr.</a> Kaye to actually send an announcement to families just to be aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4602.706s">So</a> they're not, so there's a lot of people aren't really wondering what's going on in Somerville with bridge closures. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4609.353s">So</a> it's just a new awareness for those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4612.937s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4943.467s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4944.067s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4947.37s">First</a> of all, I would like to make a motion to approve the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4950.172s">But</a> also, I would like this calendar as well as the last day of school put up on the website so people are very clear as to how early our last day of school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4962.415s">due</a> to the fact that a lot of camps don't open that early. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4966.276s">And</a> I don't know what we have scheduled for our summer fun camp, but having such an early estimated last day of school, maybe we could talk to people about even services throughout the city, recreation programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4983.121s">We</a> need this communicated throughout so parents aren't left without care for their children in an unusual year like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=4991.615s">So</a> those two motions.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5066.926s">First</a> meeting for our community <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5069.715s">It</a> was Diane Caldwell, Assistant Associate Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5073.717s">Kathy</a> Medaglio, Director of Pupil Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5076.418s">Neil</a> Osbon, Director of Diversity and Inclusion for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5080.699s">Bernadette</a> Riccidelli, Director of Curriculum and Instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5084.061s">Anthony</a> Petrellis, Director of Summer Fund Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5087.442s">Alec</a> Luric, a parent. <a

After School Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5098.427s">Kate</a> Quinn, <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5099.429s">Method</a> Recreational Department, Emily Lazzaro, Executive Assistant to the Superintendent, and thank you for taking the notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5107.056s">Dr.</a> Marice Edouard-Vincent, Superintendent of Schools, Tanya Sullivan, CPAC Co-Chair, Melanie McLaughlin, CPAC Co-Chair, Patricia Kane, Della Grace, that's Dr., from Lesley University, Beverly Evelance, <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5124.258s">Evans</a> from Lesley University, Lauren Carlin, ETL from the Andrews Public School. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5131.164s">Our</a> committee had two focuses for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5134.026s">One</a> is out-of-school time, and the second is disability awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5138.79s">At</a> this meeting, we were focusing on out-of-school time planning and coordination for vacations and summer programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5146.825s">We</a> started by describing our current programs, our before and after school program, our summer fun camp, and the city recreational program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5154.79s">We</a> discussed staffing and training for all staff and what types of accommodations are made for students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5162.234s">Before</a> and after school program has a wait list and suggestions were made to work with Lesley University to try to fill <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5170.24s">some</a> staffing needs so we can move that wait list along. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5173.962s">Also</a> a great idea was to have CCSR and honor students from Medford High School to volunteer to help the program more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5184.406s">The</a> summer fund camp was discussed and the idea of an earlier registration for programs so we can meet the needs and numbers of the campers <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5193.119s">was</a> also discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5194.36s">Three-tiered</a> pricing for early registration, regular registration, and late registration was offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5201.606s">A</a> handbook is being created for the staff, one for staff and one for families, so everybody has all the information necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5211.233s">And</a> it's clear how our summer fund clamp runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5214.416s">We</a> have an EMT on staff, a nurse distributing medications, but training for the staff has been minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5221.351s">We</a> are working to increase that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5224.475s">The</a> camp does not ever turn anyone away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5227.698s">They</a> do their best to accommodate all needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5230.301s">Even</a> if a parent needs last minute registration, no child has ever been turned away from the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5238.283s">Students</a> with disability may qualify for ESL in order to maintain and not lose social emotional skills during the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5246.206s">IEPs</a> of those students are shared with the camp administration by our special education department in early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5253.75s">They're</a> changing the registration form to encourage all participants' parents to provide IEPs and 504s for any student coming to the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5264.634s">So</a> we're able to <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5266.705s">prepare</a> for every student's need and make accommodations when necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5272.627s">Method</a> Recreation is also present at the meeting and they have a staff member who has a long history of working with students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5279.929s">They</a> are open to attend any trainings offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5283.31s">It</a> felt like it was a very productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5286.471s">Many</a> steps have been taken already to improve our programming and our communications with families. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5293.148s">The</a> meeting minutes have been attached to these notes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=5297.552s">Any</a> questions, please let us know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6752.897s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6753.938s">So</a> this is really good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6756.439s">Even</a> though a small variable or, you know, different kids or different classes or different people taking the test at different times, it gives us a broad area of which areas, like, which concepts in math we're stronger at and which ones we aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6777.667s">So</a> I like seeing some of this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6781.557s">But</a> I don't know if this is broken down by subgroups and what groups of students need more time, more attention, more tutoring for these types of evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6797.442s">So</a> I'm just wondering if you have that data that might be beneficial for people, for us to make future determinations on what subgroups might need, if they need more time, <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6811.502s">If</a> they need more practice, if they need more facilitators giving the exam or small groups or whatever, we just want to make sure that those students are also progressing and are successful in this and have every opportunity to be successful in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=6830.697s">So</a> for future reference, some subgroup information when this is presented would be helpful.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9182.751s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9183.131s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9184.132s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9185.193s">I</a> want to thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9188.476s">I'm</a> very excited about the new science program, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9192.86s">Other</a> members are thrilled that we're going to be getting that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9196.582s">But</a> I also would like, not for this report, but in future reports, subgroup categories as well as school categories, just to make sure that all of our subgroups are meeting similar benchmarks to our <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9214.408s">to</a> each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9215.568s">And</a> also, CUSP scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9217.969s">I</a> know all of you present CUSP scores, and I know that that data is important and informative for planning purposes, but I also want to know, I want people to know, yeah, we were two or three questions away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9230.792s">I</a> don't want to, not that you are, because I don't think you are, but in general, in past years, it was like, oh, but we were so close. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9239.052s">We</a> want to name what we are so we can move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9243.756s">I</a> don't want to get too tied up on CUSP scores, like we're almost there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=9247.439s">I</a> want to use it for data purposes to build and think, but I also want to acknowledge this is what we are and own what we are, so that way we make concrete steps to move forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11779.995s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11780.755s">Domenico.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11782.076s">I</a> just want to thank you all for presenting the MCAS data in this way and unpacking all of this data and bringing it down to our classrooms and our teachers so that way they're making informed choices of how they're presenting to our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11800.544s">It</a> seems like a lot of information that doesn't go anywhere, but it actually is very important work and even though we're <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11810.015s">It's</a> late for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11811.256s">I</a> mean, the data you provide is very important for us moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11815.8s">Again,</a> subgroup information is something that I like to see, and I don't like to hear the cusps, because we didn't make those benchmarks, so I don't like announcing, well, if we did a little bit better, then we would have got 78%. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11832.274s">It's</a> just not my favorite thing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11841.145s">We</a> almost got a 78, but you didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11843.166s">But</a> we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11844.066s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11844.506s">So</a> I like to put out exactly what we did so people remember the accurate numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11850.029s">That's</a> just a personal thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MKGa1KK1-VM&t=11851.429s">I</a> don't know if other members feel the same way.<h2><a href="../2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s/2019-03-08_qChIJ_zcV6s.html">Medford School Committee meeting Wednesday, March 6, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1303.509s">So,</a> thank you for submitting the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1306.873s">On</a> page 5 of 11, halfway down, it says a person's name, Smith Lena, and it says foreign language textbooks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1321.014s">That</a> makes sense then. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1323.395s">On</a> page 7 of 11 and the beginning of 8 of 11, there is a repetitive payment to a person for professional services. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1334.943s">And</a> I saw it throughout the billing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1336.904s">Is</a> that an employee, or is that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1347.775s">Which</a> evening school program would that be?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1352.056s">Great,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1357.317s">Is</a> that similar with, on page 9 of 11, fourth one up, another employee by the last name of Kirby, and the amount is $1,538?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1377.398s">And</a> then my last question is the last page, second from the last. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1382.9s">It's</a> just a large amount for McGlynn Middle School miscellaneous items for $5,900.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1399.43s">It</a> just, it just seems greater than it usually have for that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1403.713s">Thank</a> you for the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1404.794s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=1405.434s">Motion</a> to approve.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3093.187s">I</a> was there and it was so great. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3095.088s">I</a> encourage everybody in the community to buy some of the outfits that they have at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3104.351s">I</a> love them. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3106.512s">I</a> wear them every Saturday, everywhere I go. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3109.473s">Especially</a> the sweatpants with the little zip at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3114.774s">So</a> comfy. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3115.615s">It's</a> like pajamas you can wear outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3117.275s">In</a> the half zip pullover that says Medford, in the red t-shirt, because we had to search for the right color. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3124.917s">And</a> the red one really pops. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3126.577s">I</a> wasn't sure at first. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3127.917s">But</a> I'm telling you, I spent a long, long time with Hunter and a wonderful teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3134.219s">I</a> had a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3135.559s">I</a> learned a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3136.539s">And</a> the program is expanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3140.961s">I</a> have great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3143.261s">Your</a> number on my bulletin board at home, so that way I can tell everybody where to go and how to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3148.364s">And</a> thank you for all your service, and keep selling. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3151.206s">Whatever</a> you do, keep selling, because you- Your skills that you've learned here are going to carry you forward very well, and we're very proud of you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3329.703s">Can</a> we send a letter of thanks to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3332.624s">Gomez?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3334.664s">She's</a> an excellent teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3336.084s">She</a> was actually one of my children's teachers years ago, and she does a great job for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3343.605s">pay</a> for learning for our staff members is greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3350.248s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=3350.729s">I</a> think that's a great idea.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5436.689s">Do</a> we have to make those changes and That can we mend it to make sure that this paper reflects the amount of students from a proper number Yes, we make that as an amendment to approval of this item also <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5456.469s">I</a> would like to request an update on that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5462.319s">How</a> many outside students we actually have coming in from different districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5467.428s">Yeah,</a> please.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5516.807s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5634.654s">First</a> of all, I have no problem going for this to go to subcommittee because I happen to be on the subcommittee if I wasn't I Would want to be at all of these meetings because the budget is one of our main priorities as a school committee member We oversee the budget and we oversee the superintendent so <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5655.078s">I</a> really feel like I'd support anybody who's not on this committee feeling necessary to attend these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5662.446s">I</a> do have a problem with the date of April 4th and possibly some other dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=5668.472s">So,</a> other than the exact dates, if that could be changed, I'd like to hear from other committee members and make sure that the scheduled time frame works for them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6597.487s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6599.168s">Kathy,</a> Paula and I both want to speak.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6619.613s">I</a> think that having the back and forth, the spirit of it is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6624.858s">It</a> can just be executed instead of the subcommittee, but just do it as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6629.582s">Still</a> do exactly what you're talking about with these dates or similar dates, you know, and just continue forward with this plan, but just increase the amount of members present. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6643.326s">I</a> think that the idea is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6645.127s">I</a> think having knowledge about this and having that back and forth is wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6650.509s">And</a> I'll appreciate having all that knowledge when we go to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6655.21s">But</a> I do think that, as an elected official, we're elected to do those small things. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=6660.272s">And</a> if I wasn't on this committee, I would be upset by not being on it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7851.489s">We</a> received a report on the Manfred High School Student Activity Account. <a href="https://youtu.be/qChIJ_zcV6s&t=7858.29s">Could</a> we add this to the next agenda just so I could ask a few questions to it?

I have great respect, thank you for all you do.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2796.665s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2797.766s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2799.447s">So</a> having done your second set of learning walks, do you notice, <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2808.05s">I</a> know that we've encouraged, as a committee and through our administrators, to make sure that every school has the same opportunity for growth and is on the same...they're learning the same things across the district, and that one school isn't doing something differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2828.982s">consistency.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2988.722s">So</a> I just had one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2990.963s">I</a> saw the EL director. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2994.465s">Yes,</a> as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=2996.186s">Right,</a> and I'm wondering if our special education department was <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3001.644s">present</a> during the learning walks and if they're planning on being a bigger part. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3006.529s">And</a> do we go into small group settings that are also supposed to be learning, like pull-out classes?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=3073.867s">It</a> looked great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4273.662s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4275.183s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4277.204s">I</a> had the opportunity to speak to the superintendent about this prior to her presenting this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4285.648s">I</a> think this is a very fair way to make sure that both schools have equal opportunity for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4296.933s">I</a> wholeheartedly support this idea, and I also <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4301.418s">I</a> would like to talk to the superintendent about an idea that she had when she interviewed with the school committee about the possibility of having one school be a fifth, sixth grade building, and the other school be a seventh, eighth grade building, so that the children are merging, starting in fifth grade and become one group, one class moving forward from that point on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4324.57s">So,</a> I would like to make a motion on the floor to give <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4328.829s">the</a> superintendent time a few years to look at that and maybe whatever contracts we have to change with teachers or to put a team together to move our district forward in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=4345.97s">And</a> I'm looking for support from my other members.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5496.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5498.887s">I</a> just want to remind people when the new schools were built, part of the charter, the request to build the new schools was based on diversity in those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5514.585s">And</a> I know we received funding for those schools because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5517.967s">Racial</a> balance plan we had to enact. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5520.128s">It</a> was a really important piece of our new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5524.31s">And</a> I know they're not new anymore, and we don't receive federal funds anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5528.832s">But</a> the idea, the reason we received it, because it was such a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5532.874s">And</a> if we lost that along the way, we maybe need to renew that at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5541.183s">I</a> mean, as everybody knows, I do work at a charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5544.745s">And</a> there's students from all different socioeconomic backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5551.687s">And</a> the diversity goes up and down depending on the year and how many families love it and apply for their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5562.432s">And</a> I've been there for 24 years and seen those ups and downs. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5566.714s">And</a> we're seeing that a little bit right now with our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5570.205s">It</a> used to be McGlynn was the school to go to when my children were going to middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5575.848s">And</a> then it was the Andrews, and it would bounce back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5579.469s">But</a> I don't know if we ever stopped and looked at it so deeply and see the lasting effects of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5589.974s">So</a> this is our opportunity to make sure that all children are given every opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5600.385s">for</a> the best education and to be surrounded by all different types of people in their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5607.208s">So</a> I don't want to lose this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5609.709s">I</a> think starting now, February, by doing a mailing, doing a phone call, maybe doing a meeting at each elementary school for fifth grade class night or whatever, whichever way we do it, if we do all of those things and make sure we do great outreach and we just, you know, I'm sure the superintendent will <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5630.273s">I</a> think it will be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5630.873s">I'm</a> sure we'll plot a plan with the other administrators and say when we do, you know, open houses at both buildings just so parents can see both buildings, they should still do those because your child's going to be going to a different building. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5644.704s">And</a> at those opportunities, just remind people that there is a new way of how we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5651.569s">Just</a> get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5653.93s">I</a> think it will be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5655.051s">I'm</a> sure that there will be some areas or some students that <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5660.523s">not</a> with their friends and, you know, we can handle things as they come. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=5666.525s">I</a> mean, change is always a little bit hard, but then it's the new way.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=6170.945s">I</a> wanted to get up and clap.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8424.3s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8425.22s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8425.62s">I</a> had two comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8428.142s">First</a> of all, I would like to see at some point this incorporated to every child's IEP meeting, so that way parents have input of what the needs are for their children, because no one knows their child better than a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8442.078s">And</a> I would also like to include all students that are old enough or are able to communicate to be able to have some input of what works best for them in these drafts and maybe on the committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8460.311s">I</a> really feel like if you incorporated people with disabilities onto a committee that is so significant and we all learn,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8485.735s">Or</a> at lunch when students are at lunch.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8504.005s">So</a> I can envision that this being really helpful at any IEP meeting to have parents even aware of just starting to think about it prior to coming to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8516.093s">And</a> not only for our district, but throughout the state of Massachusetts and maybe the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8520.797s">So</a> children with disabilities, that this is on people's radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8526.382s">Because</a> when you receive services, you get a lot of communication from schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8533.267s">And</a> you have different touch points. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8535.269s">Like</a> you might have your school liaison call you and introduce themselves at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8540.173s">And</a> then you have your IEP meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8541.774s">You</a> have more opportunity to reach those parents and talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8545.338s">And</a> I think that that input is significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8549.04s">Not</a> only does the school providing that, but it worked in both ways.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8586.444s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TWpH9s-16mQ&t=8596.687s">So</a> moved.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=102.913s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=107.176s">So</a> on page 2 of 21, the top three items, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=114.855s">The</a> item, the vendor name is Amici's Pizza, and the account description is building repairs.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=198.421s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=199.802s">And</a> then. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=204.639s">I</a> believe that's all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=206.2s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=208.361s">Roll</a> call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=211.283s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.146s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=359.986s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=361.408s">I</a> read through the policies, and I really like a lot of the updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=365.21s">There</a> is something that I came across with a parent <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=369.414s">recently</a> that I'd like to see added, and that is a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders without parental permission.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.531s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=400.771s">Clarification</a> is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=402.712s">Getting</a> a different order from a doctor without a parent being notified is a major issue that I feel that this needs to be added, that parental permission for any, you know, changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=419.599s">Like</a> a nurse is calling a pediatrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=422.841s">Getting</a> a change in a child's medication order or <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=428.55s">And</a> not notifying a parent is not appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=432.313s">And</a> so therefore, I want to make sure parental notification is either given prior to that phone call or after that phone call that an order has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=443.681s">Because</a> in this situation, the parent was never notified of the change from her child's physician to the school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=455.13s">No,</a> I think it should be a policy on this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=458.396s">And</a> I don't think it's a conversation privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=460.697s">It</a> should never have happened to any parent to find out in a meeting in that it should be part of this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=467.038s">And</a> there is a motion on the floor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=471.319s">Under</a> Medication Orders, Parental Consent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=479.341s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=488.137s">Page</a> one.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=501.088s">A</a> consent to administer medication, but not to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=505.592s">Yeah,</a> to administer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=507.054s">But</a> this particular situation was <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=510.138s">the</a> nurse called the doctor, the order was changed after that conversation and the parent was never notified that they called the doctor or that an order was changed and the parent got no notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=524.627s">So</a> I want that addressed in this policy since we're reviewing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=529.049s">I</a> don't think that any parent would want the school nurse to change their child's orders with their doctor and not be notified.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=553.609s">Oh,</a> it absolutely is, because we're talking about policy changes in this department at this meeting, and that's something that I had firsthand knowledge of happening, and it should be addressed in these policies.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=607.04s">Actually,</a> I'm asking to amend the policy and add that a school nurse may not consult with the student's physician and get medication orders or changes without parental permission.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=620.667s">I</a> want that in section E. Section what? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=623.869s">E.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=690.487s">I</a> remove my amendment and again ask it to go to subcommittee, so that way the wording is correct.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=700.252s">Right,</a> but I don't want the document <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=702.638s">approved</a> until this issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.338s">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=704.899s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4025.653s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4027.174s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4028.354s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4029.655s">I</a> see your concerns, my colleagues' concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4033.737s">We</a> just want to make sure that there is no reason that any student's not participating. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4041.44s">I</a> also worry about the small group that's going to be left at the Andrews and what they'll be doing with their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4048.623s">Well,</a> it's a weekend trip, but on that Friday, as long as they don't <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4053.058s">you</a> know, is that community everybody's been reached out to to make sure that they're welcome to go on the trip?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4079.262s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4081.002s">My</a> other question is insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4082.903s">I</a> didn't see it listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4084.383s">Insurance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4086.304s">As</a> part of the fee involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4089.545s">We</a> did have to cancel one of these trips at one point because of things going on in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4095.066s">And</a> as a committee, we voted to make sure that parents didn't lose money and the district helped out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4100.707s">But</a> we made it so that way every trip from that point on had to cover insurance in case that were to happen.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4121.814s">So</a> for cancellation, if the school committee decides that it's for any reason not safe to send our children to another state as that trip comes closer, that is covered, and the parents will receive all of their money back?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4143.592s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4147.473s">I</a> know it might add to the ultimate cost of every child.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.015s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4152.315s">But</a> it is a policy to make sure that that is added to every trip, because we had to cancel at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4160.078s">And</a> it was a financial hardship for some parents to lose their deposits. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4165.42s">And</a> the school system did step up in that occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4170.571s">Do</a> you need this approval tonight, or could you get us those answers before we approve this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4177.612s">Or</a> we can approve it and just make sure that that policy is adhered to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4523.369s">This</a> field trip's been going on for years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4528.373s">It's</a> great for our students to get out in the environment and to do some science hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4535.298s">I</a> think it's a great learning opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4537.84s">Again,</a> I would like to make sure that all students have the opportunity to take part in it, regardless of <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4545.506s">of</a> their financial situations, and I make a motion at this time to approve and move forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4613.871s">There's</a> a second by Ms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4855.63s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4856.731s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4857.811s">First</a> of all, I would like to thank you very much for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4861.353s">I</a> know it was just added to your duties recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4865.195s">So</a> there's a lot of non- <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4867.744s">PTO</a> 5013Cs that aren't listed here, like Friends of Baseball, Friends of Soccer, Friends of those, all of those organizations raise money using Method Public Schools' name, and they're required, based on what this committee voted on, to, in order to be able to do that, is to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4894.171s">have</a> we reached out to those groups, and if so, have they answered us at all?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4956.207s">Also,</a> what type of information other than what's right in front of us are we collecting? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4961.81s">Because</a> I know the superintendent, I'm not sure if she was here when the original, it was an online form developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4971.774s">I</a> don't know if you've received that and that's what we're currently using. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4977.638s">areas</a> of who's the head of your organization, who's the president, who's the vice president? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4983.723s">Are</a> we getting all of that information from these? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4986.466s">As</a> well as, do you have a bank account? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4988.467s">Who's</a> on the bank account? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4989.708s">Like,</a> we wanted specific details. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=4992.371s">And</a> I don't know if that's been provided.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5051.69s">So</a> what about the organizations raising money using Method Public Schools that aren't, that haven't done the 5013Cs? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5061.878s">How</a> will we?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5068.223s">You</a> know, authorize those groups to raise money using our names. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5072.887s">I</a> mean, that, you know, there was this legitimate concern for the development of this project.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5280.692s">My</a> question is, so say a coach decides to run a three-week-long camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5288.558s">You</a> can pay at the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5289.659s">Does</a> that go through community schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5291.541s">Is</a> that going through this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5294.043s">How</a> are we regulating these funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5297.359s">I</a> see it on Facebook all the time, oh, we're running this event, come and pay at the door cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5302.643s">And</a> like, is that money going through the school district or is it going to that subgroup and how will we manage? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5310.049s">It's</a> just too big of an opportunity for money to be used differently than what intended.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5365.849s">So</a> when I see, oh, you can pay at the door, like, there's a lot of cash being handled at the door if there's, you know, 60 kids coming to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5380.763s">a</a> training for a day with specific coaches, and then, like, wouldn't that be the community school's desk that that fund should be going out of and not necessarily up at the door by... No, again, so there's different mechanisms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5429.687s">So</a> what had happened, and most of you had known this, but I'm not sure the superintendent did, is that people were <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5438.529s">charging</a> our students for private lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5443.933s">And</a> instead of paying our school district to use the building, they were paying the Friends of account. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5451.738s">So</a> the facilities were being used.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5507.168s">The</a> schedules are reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5508.429s">Right,</a> but also maybe we need a list of the activities groups so we have a clear picture of like, okay, <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5514.284s">So</a> these are activities groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5515.685s">Those</a> funds go through this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5517.605s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5517.946s">These</a> are our 501 groups, and their funds go this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5521.847s">And</a> maybe we should see how that works, like, annually, just like, so we know how much funds are coming in, going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5529.65s">And</a> I just want to tighten it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5531.551s">I</a> just don't want to go, I don't want what happened in the past to either continue or to happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5538.734s">It</a> was, you know,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5565.405s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5568.01s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5568.35s">I</a> think that this is bigger than we can just discuss here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5572.031s">Maybe</a> this is a committee of the whole to, like, come up with, like, policies and procedures for people being able to collect money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=5579.812s">We</a> do have policies in place.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6019.668s">One</a> last question? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6021.844s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6022.505s">The</a> Method Foundation?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6028.369s">It's</a> on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6029.25s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6029.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6030.23s">Is</a> that on the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6031.211s">It's</a> on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6032.212s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6033.093s">Oh,</a> yeah, I didn't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6034.293s">And</a> my other point is when we get the friends of the activities accounts, we also need contact information for people in charge of those accounts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6046.082s">We</a> want the same information that we're getting for <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6050.032s">the</a> PTOs and the non-profits. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6052.893s">So</a> they should fill out the paperwork in the same manner, whoever's the head of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6060.315s">No,</a> yeah, the friends of Method Soccer, the friends of Method Baseball, the friends of those, if they come up listed under activities, we need to know who's on those bank accounts.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6077.535s">All</a> right, well, what about the groups that have those others that have their own bank accounts that aren't through the schools?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6085.739s">Yeah,</a> but if they're not listed as a 501C3... We wouldn't accept that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6101.488s">And...</a> Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6104.049s">Enforcement</a> of groups that... <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6107.697s">or</a> helping them get on to 501c3 is our next goal then, to make sure that all those groups are self-reporting, because it's mandated by the school district, by the school committee.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6204.543s">With</a> the amendment that we get a follow-up report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6684.987s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6686.368s">I</a> think this is an opportunity for the school committee to work collaboratively with the city council and ask them to join us with our efforts and ask them to provide a similar letter to our governor and our legislative people. <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6704.842s">So</a> could we send a letter to our city council members and if you want any of us to go and speak <a href="https://youtu.be/XIqbZ6WsGvA&t=6715.467s">on</a> behalf of them joining, I'm more than willing to do that.<h2><a href="../2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs/2019-01-16_1uNjYgTELYs.html">January 14, 2019 Medford School Committee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=625.294s">I</a> motion to approve the payroll for this quarter, but I also have questions about the report presented and a request to have a little bit more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=637.859s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you for presenting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=641.167s">When</a> we asked for this quarterly, I know it was a long time ago, we asked for the job title and the annual salaries be listed next to the gross for the pay period.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=665.02s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=667.862s">The</a> job descriptions can be added?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=671.463s">Because</a> I remember the last one, we would say, it doesn't say what, like some people have four paid checks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=703.694s">I</a> know, but I know it can be downloaded to an Excel document, and those job descriptions can be there, because you have people's names. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=710.296s">Like,</a> some people get four paychecks. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=712.503s">So</a> I know some of its longevity, but I don't know what the other things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=717.088s">So,</a> you know, and we are supposed to be able to look at this and look at our budget book to see if we're on track, and that's really the goal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=727.039s">So</a> I would just like to table this so I can check my notes from the last meeting and the formal request that I made at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=735.063s">And</a> if that's OK, should we table in this report?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1833.845s">You're</a> all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1834.585s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1835.605s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1837.006s">So</a> as my colleague was saying about taking 30 random names, last year that's exactly what I had done and compared it to <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1846.955s">the</a> budget book and there were discrepancies in a few people's salaries and steps were given out of time frame that should have been and we had a meeting about it and that's why this report was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1865.091s">But</a> this document doesn't give us enough information and that's why I'm asking to table it <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1870.887s">so</a> we can get more information than what's presented at this time in a way that we can, you know, just pick a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1878.028s">If</a> every one of us picked three and just said, you know, my three were great, then, you know, we're doing our due diligence in moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1886.87s">So</a> that's all I want to see happen, and I want to ask a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1894.771s">Like</a> some principals are supposed to be making the same <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1898.397s">amount</a> of money we made changes at the beginning of that this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1901.419s">And</a> if you look at those two principles, they're not on this base salary in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1907.324s">And</a> I don't want to do all of that on camera for the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1912.087s">I</a> don't think it's fair to name names in someone's salary all the time in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1917.351s">So</a> I'd like to table it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1919.672s">I'd</a> like a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1921.474s">I'd</a> like to look at my notes because they may be different from what you had written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1927.873s">And</a> I definitely need a little bit more information than what's presented in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=1932.517s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2893.652s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2893.972s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2895.353s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2896.794s">First,</a> going back to the in plain sight thing, maybe an auto call to just both middle schools, like the night before, as a reminder to parents that this program is happening, just to say, hey, while you're bringing your children to the dance, or for the other school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2917.658s">that</a> we'd love to see you and it's a great opportunity to mingle with other middle school parents because they take the bus, you don't get to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2925.285s">So</a> that was one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2926.686s">Number</a> two is I really like the superintendent updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2932.691s">I</a> gather a lot of information and it's really informative and not only to me as a committee member but I'm sure anybody watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2943.881s">to</a> just hear highlights of what's happening all over the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2947.203s">So</a> I really appreciate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2948.764s">So</a> take your time and do as long as you need to, because it's really, really fun for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2955.088s">Not</a> that you needed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2957.449s">And</a> then I forget what the third thing was, so I'll just pass the floor along. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=2963.233s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3125.372s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3125.953s">I</a> remembered what my other item was. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3130.433s">Priscilla's</a> Pantry. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3132.194s">I</a> love the name too. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3134.897s">So</a> how many children attended that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3138.223s">And,</a> you know, like how many people are we serving? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3141.364s">Do</a> we have any numbers yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3142.425s">I</a> know it's early, but, and I also, I think I requested a number of like how many homeless families or students we're serving in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3152.068s">I</a> don't know if we have a, glad that I asked for that a couple weeks, maybe a month ago.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3158.07s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3159.21s">Just,</a> I don't know if we could know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3161.891s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3163.032s">I</a> work with homeless population at the school district I work at. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3167.366s">So</a> this time of year, all through the year, more and more families and children are having difficult time paying their rent and becoming homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3179.054s">So</a> things like Priscilla's Pantry, I'm very happy to see our school district, you know, take initiative with that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3187.539s">And</a> just some follow-up, like just some understanding of this population that we're serving is helpful to me.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3201.17s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3201.89s">I'm</a> just curious how many homeless families or homeless students that this district is serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3206.511s">And</a> you can probably find that by the homeless transportation numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3211.913s">That</a> would give you an estimate.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3218.734s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3219.154s">I</a> didn't realize that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3221.9s">I</a> think it's great, the fact that you're teaching them how to cook and be independent people is very impressive to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3228.247s">I</a> was just curious how many people we're serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3231.41s">I</a> want to know what it starts at so then as we watch it grow we can say, remember there was 8 kids and now there's 80 kids.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3526.541s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3526.742s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3527.442s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3528.483s">This</a> is great, a good way to welcome families into their first experience with our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3537.409s">I</a> just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3539.051s">Will</a> interpreters be present at any of the open house?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3551.145s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3551.946s">That</a> represents the Neenah community. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3554.268s">Also,</a> I'm wondering if the registration office, the Parent Information Center, is going to have more staffing this year, later hours, and interpreters available, because last year there were some needs of <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3571.415s">families</a> that came to my attention?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3602.615s">That</a> was my next question. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3603.896s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3619.479s">So</a> I'm more curious about the Parent Information Center and when parents need to access that and if there's any way we can streamline that and be really prepared <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3630.055s">for</a> new families to make it as easy for them as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3634.279s">Because</a> for some families, getting up to the high school is difficult back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3641.685s">And</a> if they have to go repeatedly because they forgot paperwork or they don't understand everything, a few families ran into that last year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3654.215s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3666.481s">As</a> long as there's interpreters and health person there that can help them with the health documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3672.565s">And</a> we're very clear in our packets of what they need to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3676.787s">And</a> maybe staff more, because a lot of this information takes a while to process with each parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3686.742s">So</a> if there's only one person there, or if they step out for lunch, or to go to the bathroom, and if someone comes and it's not there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3885.023s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3886.803s">Getting</a> back to the language that my colleague was talking about, about the after school program, there are some families that didn't even get added to a wait list at the beginning of this year when they tried to add their children on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3905.678s">So</a> I'm not sure we are meeting the needs of our families in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3910.901s">And</a> I would like a report or I would like some information on the numbers of students in the wait list for after school and before school programming so we can maybe start addressing the needs of the district in hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3928.651s">earlier.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3929.072s">I</a> know hiring is very difficult.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=3990.649s">I</a> just want to know what we need to meet the need of the current families on the wait list, even without worrying about kindergartners coming in.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4008.238s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4362.472s">Chaperone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4363.673s">Chaperone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4364.254s">At</a> every trip.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=4371.32s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6124.754s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6126.735s">Have</a> we reached out to our 5013Cs, our PTOs, our friends of, and told, informed them that they are required to register with the Medford Public Schools in order to utilize and fundraise using our... So again, we don't have all of their direct contact information and that's the purpose of gathering it at this point in time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6200.967s">Actually,</a> what this committee voted was that it was mandatory for all, and it shouldn't say PTO training update, it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6210.683s">5013C,</a> PTO, and Friends Of, because it's not that one small group. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6216.085s">And</a> we do, and I think our principals know a lot about who's raising money in these groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6225.048s">And</a> we should be reaching out to contact them that they have a deadline to register with our online program through Emily, because a lot of them haven't, that I've talked to recently, haven't heard that they're supposed to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6240.017s">So</a> I think we need to do more because it was mandated by this body that it was a mandatory, it wasn't volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6252.84s">And</a> I keep hearing that at updates and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6255.341s">It's</a> not voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6256.901s">If</a> you're going to do business and raise money using Medford Public Schools or students of Medford Public Schools in any way, shape, or form, you are to be <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6265.734s">listed</a> with us who is on your bank accounts, who is the president of your group, who is the contact person, and what their phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6273.257s">I</a> mean, Janine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6276.618s">I</a> understand, but the deadlines, they go hand in hand, and the deadline for that is soon, February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6284.521s">So</a> if we haven't started reaching out to them, we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6287.802s">This</a> is something I'm going to follow up on. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6291.084s">And</a> the people I have talked to haven't heard anything yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6295.472s">I'm</a> not sure how extensive it goes to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6299.853s">I</a> just know that we need to take action and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6304.935s">It</a> was mandated by this body, and I want to see movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6308.416s">And</a> I do know that there's supposed to be an update to us mid to late February as to how many people who have signed up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6325.209s">Okay,</a> and the groups I have talked to haven't even been informed that they're supposed to have this information to the school district as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6331.453s">So</a> that's the piece I'm concerned about at this point, because we're halfway through January, and they have a February 1st enrollment, and if they're not even aware they're supposed to, they have to pull those documents while they're doing their taxes for their 5013Cs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6347.865s">That's</a> why we gave it this deadline and this timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/1uNjYgTELYs&t=6354.238s">I</a> just hope that we can make this a priority in the next few weeks so that way we have that.<h2><a href="../2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc/2019-01-09_CKGzHQJRVWc.html">Medford School Committee meeting January 7, 2019</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=792.17s">It's</a> been a pattern for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=800.013s">I</a> didn't flag it, so if I had a question, I'll come back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=803.295s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=804.256s">Motion</a> to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1763.416s">Just</a> to let the superintendent know, the Carpentries Shop at the Medford High School for years has made bed frames for homeless families because when a homeless family gets housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1777.052s">They</a> cannot move in until they have a bed for every child. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1780.474s">And</a> when you're homeless and you're just starting out, you have nothing to fill that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1785.437s">So</a> our students have always built beds for people in our community in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1790.94s">And</a> I think there was a spotlight on them a few years ago about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1795.563s">It's</a> just a wonderful, one of the wonderful programs that our vocational students reach out to and help people throughout the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1803.407s">I</a> actually was telling a group that was looking to donate money <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1806.962s">to</a> reach out to Chad Fallon to talk to them about maybe buying the mattresses if the kids could make the beds and really get people in housing quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1819.318s">So</a> I'm glad to see that they're continuing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=1821.921s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2022.641s">Could</a> we send a letter of thank you?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2215.812s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2217.213s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2218.514s">So</a> I'd like to know who will actually hire and oversee this person since they're joint between the school and the city side.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2247.275s">And</a> my other question is, will the school security staff then report to this person?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=2260.581s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4681.898s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4684.12s">I</a> too wanted to thank the doctor for bringing this information forward to make sure that this paperwork is on our blogs and may be sent to our PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4692.722s">So</a> when they have parent meetings that the education is there for them to access. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4701.065s">As</a> well as our students, I think especially at our high school level, maybe during health class or whatever classes, I'm not sure exactly how this is being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4711.848s">But</a> since it is a crisis that we need to stop now, we have to have strict policy in place <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4719.793s">and</a> be ready to help our children make better choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4724.735s">Very</a> strict, like we do for any other toxin ingested during the school day, social probation, and help. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4736.74s">We</a> recently received an email as a committee by a family in the district whose child was vaping and asked for our help. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4745.623s">And</a> our administration reached out to that person <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4749.739s">But</a> if there's one, there's many. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4751.66s">And</a> if we're getting one email, there's 100 children or families experiencing the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4758.862s">My</a> brother was an addict in high school and now is no longer living. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4763.664s">It</a> was a different drug, and it took his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4766.825s">I</a> believe that this is just as dangerous as what he did, because I think the effects of inhaling chemicals that we don't even know are in those vapes into your lungs and into your body <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4780.538s">that</a> could have the potential to be lethal for some of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4785.72s">And</a> I would hate to see a family go through what my family did because of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4790.922s">So</a> I'm committed to working on this as a committee member and as a community member. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4796.664s">And</a> I'm glad that you live in Method, because not that you wouldn't be invested, but that pulls you in even a little tighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4803.246s">So</a> through the next year, I'd like to have a committee, the health committee or a subcommittee, <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=4809.027s">to</a> really focus on our role as leaders in the community, not only in our schools, but in our community in general, and working with the city council and the mayor's office to make sure that our community is safe for our developing children.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6829.236s">A</a> policy for the superintendent, and I'll get this submitted to two, three to seven folks, so that, you know, when I'm, when a book comes out, for every parent, who's just dying next year, this is the policy, if your child's mom will be taking a class, right, and you're handling similar to a five or five series movie, then they are required to go through this program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6889.488s">And</a> if you're getting a school ticket and you've been logged in and you have three tickets, you're required on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6900.982s">do</a> you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6905.085s">You're</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6911.609s">I'm</a> sorry, I don't get to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6928.203s">Video</a> culture will go off whenever other toxins are going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6932.706s">And</a> I don't want to show people's lives later on because we don't know now. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6938.551s">And</a> we have a program set up in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=6940.853s">I</a> went to those community meetings.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7060.82s">I</a> think what
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=7088.066s">I</a> need a second on the move up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8806.244s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8807.064s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8808.285s">Thank</a> you for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8810.588s">So</a> on page 3 of 10, and you might not have this answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8816.112s">The</a> superintendent might help. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8818.614s">It</a> says halfway down the page for the amount of $14,500 and the line below it $14,982. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8828.517s">instructional</a> support staff for the Brooks and for the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8832.519s">Do</a> we not hire that staff or has that position been left open for any reason?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8869.904s">In</a> the future, will those line up more?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8882.963s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8883.603s">Also,</a> for the Brooks School Elementary textbooks, they still have a balance of $4,000, and the Roberts does as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8892.57s">The</a> reason I say this is because last year at end of budget, some of the principals came forward and didn't realize there was a cutoff or didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8901.38s">didn't</a> know enough about their budget, maybe on their part or our part for not educating them, of where they have funds to spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8911.349s">So</a> I just want to make sure that every principal has gone over their budget, knows that they have these funds to utilize for the year, make sure that they have what they need and are not holding back from providing supplies like textbooks or staff.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8937.12s">So</a> the Roberts and the Brooks realizes they still have 4,000 each in books available for them to order for the school year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8949.402s">And</a> last year we talked about sending a reminder email to all principals and department heads, <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8957.668s">around</a> this time of year, so when you do your early cutoff so you can reconcile your books, that they have sufficient time to get their POs in. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8966.076s">I</a> just want to make sure that they weren't... She said not when they're gone.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8970.02s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8970.541s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8972.663s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8973.484s">And</a> then my other questions were... <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8976.387s">Vocational</a> pupil transportation, $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8980.728s">We</a> hadn't utilized that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=8981.888s">Is</a> that additional savings for students no longer going to college?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9001.871s">Further</a> down that page, again, was textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9006.758s">I'm</a> going to move on from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9009.379s">Math</a> department office supplies haven't used their $500 allocation on page 7 of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9020.741s">And</a> then I noticed, like, computer teacher at the Roberts.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9059.384s">So</a> that explains a lot of it, excluding the library, aid, and Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9064.881s">If</a> that's probably a similar situation then? <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9067.622s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9068.202s">And</a> then the operation and maintenance secretary salary is also in that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9077.985s">So</a> I don't know if it's allocated differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9079.806s">Do</a> we have a person in that position?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9110.548s">I</a> mean, it used to be very hard to see a lot more of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9115.13s">And</a> a lot of the ones I had today, again, with salary, and we don't have that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9119.855s">Thank</a> you for the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9121.256s">It's</a> good to see that we're on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9123.198s">And</a> my only concern was making sure all department heads' needs were met for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9128.243s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9129.144s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/CKGzHQJRVWc&t=9129.304s">Vandeclote.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg/2018-12-20_R49wqTZ5YIg.html">Medford School Committee meeting Monday, December 17, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2247.142s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2248.363s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2250.163s">This</a> is my favorite night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2251.424s">When</a> we sat on meetings with beautiful music and all of you donating your time to play for us and the community, just really puts a big smile on my face. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2262.873s">I</a> love to hear you all play, and it's especially important to me because this is one of the few times that we get to hear Mr. Zigny play as well, and he's not just conducting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2274.242s">So</a> when I open the door and I heard the music, the minute you open the door, it goes all the way through City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2280.157s">It</a> just puts a big smile on everybody's face. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2282.639s">And</a> thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2283.98s">And</a> thank you for the parents for bringing your children here and sharing their talent with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2288.964s">We</a> appreciate it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2322.576s">When</a> I was looking through the minutes, I noticed that <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2330.768s">Towards</a> the back, we were talking about the 5013Cs and how the superintendent assigned her new executive assistant, Emily, to work that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2343.712s">I</a> was wondering if we could add to that, and I don't know if it's allowed, to just give us a report at the end of February to just see how it's going and making sure she's not overwhelmed and, you know, just a little add-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2357.703s">if</a> you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2358.383s">And</a> motion to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2365.045s">Yeah,</a> like who registered, how many left, and how much work it actually takes for our staff.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2388.539s">Seconded</a> by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2391.0s">Mayor</a> Burke, I just had a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2392.741s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2394.262s">Of</a> course, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2396.423s">Actually,</a> it's on page 14 of 24, school committee dues, $247.98 to one member. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2409.069s">I'm</a> assuming it's for the conference, but I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2414.395s">14</a> of 24, halfway down. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2417.919s">The</a> amount is $247.98.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3182.873s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3184.825s">I</a> make a motion to accept this as is and revisit it in January and ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3189.929s">Ray</a> to report on additional adding of other options for our students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3406.84s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3407.201s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3408.941s">So</a> I have to say I don't love number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3412.883s">If</a> a school committee member acts in a fashion that is unbecoming, may be subject to censure by two-thirds of the vote of the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3420.847s">Well,</a> what items are unbecoming? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3422.587s">Who</a> decides that? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3423.948s">Like,</a> that just can be anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3427.129s">And</a> censure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3429.623s">I</a> don't report to my fellow members. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3431.864s">I</a> report to the people who voted for me to be their voice at this seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3438.106s">And</a> so I would pull off item five totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3445.568s">And</a> I wouldn't sign off on this document with that on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3451.65s">And</a> I think people would have a hard time censoring me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3456.232s">Good</a> luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3460.84s">because</a> that's my job as a committee member is to speak my mind for the people who are elected me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3466.183s">And</a> if other people get a right to censor what I say or find that what I say is unbecoming because they don't like it for any way, shape, or form, or my attitude, or the way that I might present it, or how passionate I am about an issue, I think is very dangerous to put in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3484.311s">And</a> I think it would be so impossible to regulate <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3488.204s">Because</a> I think you know me for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3491.107s">I'm</a> hot enough to regulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3492.429s">It's</a> just not going to work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4212.838s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, does two items on up, I second having the meet and greet on February, would have a day that, is it actually Valentine's Day?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4229.017s">OK,</a> so at the Valentine's Day social that the Method Family Network provides, I second the motion on the floor for us to have that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4243.769s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4774.496s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4775.516s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4778.536s">Under</a> community participation, I got a note from the daughter of Lena DeGentema, so regarding the event we had, those of you who don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4790.715s">We</a> named the music room the Gigentmaso Music Room.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4796.978s">Oh,</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4798.659s">So</a> from her daughter, she just wrote, Erin, thank you again for the wonderful evening last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4804.002s">The</a> ceremony that the district provided was truly humbling. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4811.626s">And</a> my mom loved this dedication more than words could tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4816.8s">Thank</a> you for a wonderful, memorable night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4819.322s">And</a> please tell Lisa Evangelista we realize how much time and effort she put into the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4825.507s">So.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6169.899s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6170.139s">Domenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6171.62s">Was</a> part of the reason you chose the interior courtyard because of the deer that come out in the evening? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6179.286s">And</a> now the bear.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6209.31s">I</a> really like the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6210.57s">I</a> think it's going to look beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6212.011s">And</a> that courtyard needed a little sprucing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6215.651s">So</a> thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6385.701s">So</a> I just wanted to take an opportunity to say thank you as well.<h2><a href="../2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc/2018-12-05_n-uYCOJ8CVc.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 3, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1936.454s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1937.815s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1939.496s">It's</a> very nice to have in writing someone's goals and where their focus is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1944.94s">I</a> think it's very helpful for the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1948.882s">They</a> get to hear your voice and what you think the priorities are for your first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1953.666s">And</a> I just wanted to expand a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1956.467s">You</a> talk a lot about mathematics, and the reason for that is because when you joined us, you saw that that was the greatest need. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1963.555s">for</a> our district to focus on for this year, and I just wanted it to be out there that that's why that was chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1969.197s">It</a> wasn't arbitrary. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1970.698s">It</a> was based on data in MCAS scores, and that was your assessment at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1976.881s">And</a> as an instructional leader in your previous job, we felt that we would, you know, focus on that as a committee with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1987.285s">And</a> so just so the community knows, that's why mathematics is highlighted in your goals so directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=1993.672s">And</a> in future years, those goals will change as the district needs change. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2000.316s">Again,</a> thank you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2004.018s">It's</a> really good to have this, especially when it comes time for us as a committee to do your review. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2011.745s">we</a> can look back at what your goals were and how you've probably overshot most of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2018.069s">That's</a> my prediction. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2020.41s">I</a> do have a question about some of the happenings that you had in MedFit, but I'll wave to my colleagues if anybody else had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2032.216s">Going</a> back...
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2147.186s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2148.927s">Just</a> a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2150.228s">I</a> know that the Medford High School Mall extended their hours until four. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2156.607s">I</a> remember before we had the retail shop through the vocational school, that as a PTO parent, I used to open the shop like one or two nights prior to the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2172.279s">And</a> so parents could come after work, like 6 or 7 at night, and buy MAJS swag for their family members as Christmas gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2185.248s">I</a> don't know if we have time or ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2189.451s">I</a> think even myself would love to get some new gear before it's kind of early in the day to get across many towns from work to there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2200.277s">So</a> I don't know if you could look it into, even if it's just one night, and have it staffed really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2208.642s">I</a> know that I need a lot of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2211.044s">Also,</a> do they take credit card? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2213.813s">or</a> is it cash only, or how they pay for that would be helpful as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2220.294s">They</a> take credit card now? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2221.554s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2244.866s">And</a> my second one is the Key Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2248.307s">I</a> know that you mentioned that they're doing a canned food drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2251.227s">But</a> years ago, they used to do caroling throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2254.508s">So</a> I don't know if that's something that they still do. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2258.129s">I</a> know you could make a donation or a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2261.61s">I</a> don't know if you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2262.91s">And</a> they used to hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2264.27s">If,</a> say, you were having a holiday party in your house, they would come and carol at your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2268.351s">So</a> I was just wondering if that was still something that they were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2272.552s">It</a> was a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2273.913s">when</a> you had a big family gathering, and you'd have all of Method High's Key Club coming in and singing, and you'd give them hot chocolate and cookies.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2296.297s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2296.817s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2298.197s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2298.877s">Is</a> there a motion to accept the superintendent's oath... So motioned.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2809.482s">Congrats.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2810.623s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2812.285s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2812.805s">First</a> of all, I want to congratulate you and everybody that made it possible, the parents, the band members. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2819.751s">You've</a> really grown this program since the day you started. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2823.674s">You</a> hit the ground running and you've done a tremendous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2827.197s">I</a> wanted to congratulate you personally on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2833.115s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2835.637s">I</a> also read through your packet, and I'm ready to approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2839.919s">There's</a> only one issue that I saw with it, and I spoke to you directly about it, is a few years ago, the school committee made it mandatory that all students take out the insurance when they're traveling. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2850.645s">So</a> if you make that change in this, I motion to approve it and volunteer to go if an extra <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2859.483s">person</a> is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=2861.164s">So</a> remember, I was first.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3399.175s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3399.795s">I</a> only have a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3403.556s">At</a> the Roberts fourth and fifth grade, there's a significant increase in the amount of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3409.902s">I</a> realize that part of that is because first year ELL students are sent to the Brooks and then they have the right to come back to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3423.728s">Is</a> that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3424.348s">Is</a> that how it's working, Diane?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3447.407s">So</a> those numbers won't be as high for fourth grade next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3451.709s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3451.829s">Just</a> fifth grade will continue to be high and they'll move out? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3454.411s">Yes,</a> they'll be followed in the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3455.691s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3455.972s">I</a> was just curious if that was the case or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3458.433s">That</a> was my first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3460.114s">And</a> then my other question is, thank you for breaking it down by subgroups. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3463.676s">That's</a> really good for us to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3468.091s">You</a> know, it's a snapshot of the district and what we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3471.993s">There's</a> just one thing I was hoping that we could also know is like how many homeless families and students we have in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3480.598s">I</a> don't know if you have that count. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3483.439s">It's</a> just, especially this time of year, I'm very aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3486.981s">I</a> take care of the homeless families for another district, so I'm well aware that a lot more people recently in the district I work at <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3497.246s">have</a> become homeless, and I was just wondering where we are in Medford and how many families and where they're sheltering them, if we know that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3506.994s">And</a> it doesn't have to be tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3508.936s">I</a> was just curious just to have a snapshot of our district and the needs of the people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3518.003s">So</a> if we could get that at a later date, that would be great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3533.351s">Okay,</a> that's fine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3667.56s">Mayor</a> Burke, just as a follow-up, both my children were members of those classrooms many years ago, because they're 27 and 25 now, and both learned an exceptional amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3680.863s">They</a> still remember <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3683.215s">a</a> lot of the things that they did on a daily basis in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3687.024s">And</a> it really enhanced, they were the model students, they were the typical developing students. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3693.302s">that</a> they called them all the students back then.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3707.065s">And</a> it's a tremendous program. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3708.765s">So</a> anybody listening that has a child, it's a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3717.747s">The</a> tuition is not expensive, or it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3723.107s">It's</a> a really, really wonderful way for your child to develop and grow within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3732.835s">And</a> it helps them prepare for school. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3735.437s">A</a> lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3737.219s">A</a> lot, a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3739.981s">I</a> think that some of those teachers are still there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3979.483s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3981.264s">Thank</a> you for the report, and thank you for adding the revolving amounts, because I probably would have asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3989.31s">So</a> I had a question to start off with. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=3992.512s">Is</a> the beginning balances for all of those programs, the ME program and the after school, before school, they all started with the negative balance?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4038.335s">In</a> future, could you give us the balance on that amount, like the total on that column? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4051.157s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4051.938s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4054.298s">Oh,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4056.618s">It's</a> just so we can just see it nice and easy, and it's right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4064.08s">Yeah,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4065.475s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4067.056s">And</a> then we can just look at big picture and then it's a little easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4072.56s">So</a> the only question I had is, another question I had actually is page three of nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4079.626s">And</a> then it was like, under elementary schools, the last four items, did those schools not use all of their <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4093.021s">textbooks</a> allocated fee allocated amounts or that's correct so whatever was expensed is what was utilized and any balances were what was remaining from the allocation provided I just wanted I just saw two things last year is that towards the end of the school year some principals when they came forward hadn't <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4118.798s">and</a> purchase requests for things soon enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4121.939s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we work with them this year to make sure that they're aware to start pre-ordering in time before the accounting department needs to close out their books.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4165.588s">Okay,</a> and my last thing is the athletics department. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4168.869s">And</a> I understand the need, and by no means do we want to change anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4172.67s">We</a> have great programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4175.935s">a</a> wide range, a variety of things that all our students have taken advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4182.999s">But</a> I thought when we did the budget, we raised their pre-budgeted amount so that way it would reflect on what the need was so we weren't going to be at the end of the year doing this again.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4239.754s">Can't</a> win for winning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4242.056s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4243.337s">Okay,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4244.317s">I</a> just want to keep moving forward for that because it makes it look like we're not funding it well and I would rather be proactive than reactive with that because I don't want to cut anything and I don't want people to think, oh, <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4259.068s">you</a> know, it's over budget all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4260.95s">We</a> need to budget it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4263.673s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4264.154s">I</a> appreciate the answers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4896.786s">Isn't</a> that the committee that you were on that they had to file? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4902.908s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4903.548s">So</a> we will have, be able to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4907.169s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=4907.749s">Once</a> that goes, it was supposed to go into effect in October.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5321.783s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, a question on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5323.484s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5325.405s">So</a> there was a subcommittee on this last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5331.227s">My</a> colleagues were on. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5333.048s">And</a> we had a presentation by Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5335.569s">She</a> presented this online. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5338.792s">program</a> that all our PTOs and friends of groups were supposed to start utilizing by October 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5349.477s">And</a> with the transition of the new superintendent and the administrative team, that deadline hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5355.997s">So</a> we already have the form and it's been approved by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5359.298s">I</a> would like to move forward with the date for all our current PTOs and friends of account to start using those. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5368.819s">And</a> I would like to see everybody registered by February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5373.06s">I</a> think that's a significant amount of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5375.041s">I</a> know with the holidays, it gives them the whole month of January after that to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5380.702s">And</a> they'll be looking at doing their <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5383.337s">Taxes</a> for the 5013 C. So they'll have the documents right in front of them So I'm making a motion at this point to continue what we voted on for October 1st with to continue that and have all of our groups beyond on that line in facilitated by Emily by by February 1st of 2019 and
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5482.667s">Actually,</a> it was a little bit more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5485.89s">They</a> had certain requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5488.111s">Maybe</a> we should provide, maybe we could ask Jenny Graham to come and present the form to us to refresh us of what's on there, so that way we all see it again, because it was almost a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5498.819s">Or</a> at least to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5500.841s">Do</a> you have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5504.107s">Right,</a> and we did make it mandatory at our meeting last year that all groups affiliated with using friends of or PTOs, anything reflecting it was mandatory, it wasn't voluntary for those groups to submit their information, otherwise they weren't allowed to raise funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5528.242s">using</a> four Method High groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5530.786s">So</a> it's not a voluntary thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5532.508s">I</a> just wanted to be very clear that any group raising funds for students <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5536.929s">student</a> activities that, through MEDFED, have mandated to register. <a href="https://youtu.be/n-uYCOJ8CVc&t=5543.695s">I</a> just wanted to be very clear on that.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2878.652s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2879.652s">So</a> can we get Mr. Russo's very important questions in a follow-up report in the next few weeks after these trainings have come? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2888.455s">Like</a> how many people have come, all those specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2893.977s">And</a> we can email you them if you need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2896.918s">That</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2897.598s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2898.958s">So</a> that way we don't expect people to come with the answers prior to the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2905.2s">But</a> after the training, it's really nice to have you come back and say how it went, how much participation, and if you feel like what went really well and what changes you would make for next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2916.85s">And</a> they were very good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2919.432s">My</a> question was, I just want to make sure we're incorporating the Curtis Tufts program that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2926.658s">We</a> have an alternative high school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2928.6s">I</a> would really like to see their presence at all of these trainings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2932.163s">These</a> are experts that deal with <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2934.684s">children's</a> needs all day, as well as our director of student services. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2939.667s">They</a> are experts within our district, and I think that they could bring a lot of value by their presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2945.831s">And</a> them going and hearing what this, whoever, all people, all parties attending, their concerns are, they also grow as educators and figure out what the needs are for the district and how to make <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2962.29s">our</a> programs meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2964.931s">And</a> it will help for pre-planning and being proactive rather than reactive about the needs within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2972.294s">So</a> I strongly recommend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=2976.055s">And</a> I motion to accept the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5071.401s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5072.682s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5073.182s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5075.404s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5077.245s">I</a> know in the past, you used to do two different nights, one for vocational and one <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5082.393s">the</a> high school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5083.214s">And</a> I know since the merger that we try to combine it because it is one school with two programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5090.519s">And</a> I just want to make sure students that not necessarily think the high school might be for them might get that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5101.608s">And</a> the opposite as well, students that might not have thought of the vocational programming or looking at it <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5109.905s">have</a> that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5110.746s">So</a> I do like the idea of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5113.828s">It's</a> just a lot to cover in one evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5115.909s">And</a> I just was wondering how, you know, if you're going to have another night and maybe in the spring, just because people weren't able to get around.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5422.354s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5424.675s">I'll</a> follow up to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5426.216s">I</a> know that they had summer program, like a preview of different programs that the high school vocational programming offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5435.119s">Is</a> that going to be in the works for next summer as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5437.32s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=5437.52s">And</a> can we advertise that very early?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6647.465s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6648.916s">So</a> I really think that my colleague is trying to do is have like a brainstorming, meet the school committee, bring your talent and your ideas for us, like maybe a goal setting meeting with the school committee present, like to hear what the community thinks are priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6671.352s">thinks</a> ways that they can join the school committee in different ways, the school department in different ways and be helpful, active participants in the school community as a whole as opposed to having a more formal meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6688.547s">If</a> I'm hearing you correctly from what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6693.172s">And</a> I think he's looking for an opportunity to have a way for people to access, to have access to us as a committee and to just like volunteer and give us ideas and priorities and like dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6708.799s">More</a> so than like an official meeting with administrators and <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6714.89s">That,</a> is that what, am I hearing correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6717.391s">Is</a> that more what you're looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6718.972s">I</a> need some clarity on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6734.28s">Community</a> participation throughout the district in ways that parents and, you know, community participation and involvement <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6745.647s">both</a> with the school department and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6748.33s">It's</a> just to open it up, to hear the voices of the people in our community and to meet them and to see what they have to offer and what they'd like to do and what they see our future as. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6760.442s">At</a> least that's what I'm hearing and I could be off base. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=6764.466s">I</a> don't know if my colleague wants to clarify a little bit more.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7160.129s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7160.829s">Before</a> we move to executive session, could we just go over the requested reports? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7165.974s">I</a> think we've received some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7167.475s">And</a> just make sure that the list is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7177.523s">If</a> we could get an update of where we are on that in the next few weeks or early January, that would be great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7213.44s">Will</a> we receive one big report with every school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7223.424s">And</a> is there a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7224.805s">Do</a> you have an idea of when that would be?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7227.486s">It's</a> a part of the executive session.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7231.227s">Gotcha.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7235.902s">We</a> had an update on that and we'll be having a follow-up meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dEbbUcBxDAE&t=7239.366s">I</a> just want to speak with the superintendent about scheduling that and my associates, of course, as well as the special education and the special education pack.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=578.405s">It's</a> probably very easily explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=580.487s">On</a> page 7 of 8, it says three quarters of the way down, I'd say, right above the vocational automotive supplies is SPED pro-development expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=597.401s">Did</a> they come in? <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=598.222s">Did</a> we send people out? <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=599.283s">I</a> was just curious what we were doing for professional development for the special education department.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=618.936s">And</a> I had one more question since you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=621.437s">It</a> was on page 5 of 8 and the bottom of 4 of 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=633.614s">Riddell</a> All-American Athletic Officials, the total looks like about $9,000, and I was just wondering, I know it looks like a company, but it just seems like a lot of money for athletic officials, and it might be like five different sports or, I don't know, I just saw a lot of athletic officials individually paid, which I know we hire <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=658.621s">individual</a> people, but when I saw this large amount, $3,027.40, and then $5,596.39, and a $416.37 together, it's about $9,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=664.346s">I</a> was just wondering, <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=675.91s">if</a> you knew a little bit more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FL68V2M-0Ng&t=677.611s">It</a> seemed like a lot of money.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=888.097s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1604.712s">Just</a> a point of information, open houses at the high school and the vocational school <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=1611.175s">You</a> can't go in and sell them there?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2636.343s">Mrs.</a> Rappori, part of it is I want to thank you for always giving our students this opportunity to see the world, especially with service projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2646.311s">Because</a> I think when our children get to go and see an area, they come home a little more thankful for what they have, appreciative of their family and their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2659.141s">And</a> I think it changes who they are from that point forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2662.737s">And</a> I think it's something that these 39 children will carry forward, as well as all the children you have brought before. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2670.22s">So</a> as a committee member, I thank you for taking our students and all the other staff members that give up their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=2677.744s">And</a> one of these days, I am going to come.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3489.156s">Thank</a> you, Mrs. Mistone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3493.497s">There</a> was no mention of the Columbus School in the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DHppOEsfgwM&t=3496.958s">Are</a> we going to try to get them on board as well?<h2><a href="../2018-10-03_psVhVz9ZIEQ/2018-10-03_psVhVz9ZIEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 1, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=306.761s">Always</a> help with something, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=309.342s">Thank</a> you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=309.903s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=311.483s">On</a> page 2 of 10, <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=317.128s">It</a> says about a quarter of the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=319.43s">Game</a> time, $3,771.26 for operation and maintenance of contracted building. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=329.618s">I</a> just didn't know what game time was.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=335.662s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=336.203s">Makes</a> sense then. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=337.123s">I</a> was wondering what games we were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=339.605s">Is</a> it installed and all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=341.587s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=342.507s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=343.108s">Kids</a> are sliding. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=343.788s">That's</a> awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=344.909s">Thank</a> you for your work on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=413.739s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=415.401s">Could</a> Mr. McLaughlin let us know when that's completed?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=421.405s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=423.847s">Just</a> a quick one.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=477.489s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=478.83s">I</a> know last year, and I forget the dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=481.011s">I'm</a> just asking for someone to remind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=483.412s">I</a> know that we do a complete audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=486.673s">And</a> when would we get that audit, as well as how often we're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=492.067s">see</a> the actual payrolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=493.607s">I</a> know it was biannually, but I didn't remember if it was like November or if it was January.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=533.044s">I</a> thought we had agreed, like, biannually we would get a complete payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=537.406s">And</a> just so we know, because we're voting on payroll twice a year, I think that's what we voted on during last year, last spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=546.488s">That's</a> my understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=547.689s">In</a> January, it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=549.122s">if</a> that works in your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=550.603s">Okay,</a> certainly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=554.004s">Yeah,</a> and then... Right, because we still have... I think that's what we decided on. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=556.645s">I</a> just wanted to make sure I had the dates correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=559.987s">I</a> couldn't remember if it was November or January that we had stated, but I know we had voted, because I think we were talking quarterly, and then we thought that was too cumbersome for your department, so we moved it to biannually. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=571.572s">So,</a> we'll remember and go with January.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=575.277s">And</a> again, you know, the end of May, early June, because the end of the year is so crazy, if that works for you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5398.337s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5399.098s">Thank</a> you, Megan. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5400.338s">Megan</a> and I have been neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5403.139s">When</a> she lived in Medford, she was on my street. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5405.5s">And</a> her daughter actually went to the Columbus School.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5411.562s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5412.202s">And</a> so I was thrilled to have Megan receive this position, because as soon as I heard it, I knew that we were in for really quality instruction to our staff, who could then give it to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5427.712s">and</a> I'm very excited as you grow in the position and you are able to fully staff your positions that we can grow the program and then we can talk about meeting all different subgroups and needs of all of our students and we can grow it in that manner as well to make sure that we're doing that and I've spoken to the superintendent about future that. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5453.607s">Right</a> now, staffing is the priority <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5456.587s">Another</a> thing is priority is customer service to our parents and our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5464.273s">I</a> did speak with someone from the Columbus School who said that they're not on the wait list because when they approached about after school, it was like, oh, there's no way. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5473.981s">The</a> list is already so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5476.503s">Sent</a> that parent an email saying, here's some other resources in town, good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5481.547s">And</a> they weren't added to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5482.988s">And</a> I've spoke to you directly about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5484.649s">And</a> I know you're making effective change in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5487.431s">But</a> that parent, as of right now, as of today, when I checked with them, said that they were still not on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5493.475s">I</a> don't know if someone added them since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5495.856s">But</a> there may be other parents out there that aren't on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5499.899s">And</a> I don't know how to go back and address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5502.6s">But</a> we just need to make sure that every family with need <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5512.303s">given</a> the chance for us to meet that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5516.365s">I</a> mean, it's so important because we have working parents and single families and parents with family members with medical needs or all of the above that really look to us to help them to be able to afford to work in order to take care of their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5538.783s">So</a> this is really, really out, and I call it out of school time. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5542.624s">I</a> know that we don't call it that as a community, but I'd like to, at some point, sit down with the committee and talk about out of school time and how we care for students and how we manage them during school breaks and during summers and to include everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5558.629s">So</a> I look at it as the biggest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5560.449s">So</a> I know that you're gonna look into that at all schools, not just the Columbus, and to make sure that the wait list is <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5568.418s">accurate</a> and really fill the gaps where the biggest needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5573.561s">Just</a> because there are more students at one school doesn't mean that the students at the less populated schools don't have greater needs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5586.267s">So</a> those are a few of my concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5588.708s">I</a> know that you're staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5590.029s">I</a> know that you're working really hard to recruit people. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5595.368s">When</a> the Boys and Girls Club in Somerville closed, I was hoping that we could get some of those staff members and bring them over to ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5602.155s">That</a> was such a great find.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5611.103s">So</a> if anybody in the community hears, we are hiring Medford 2 to 6 for our after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5618.311s">I</a> also think that there are some opportunities that we could put forward, like providing free CPR and maybe free fingerprinting, just to fill the roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5627.973s">I</a> know that as a district, we don't usually do that, but the people in these positions are such part-time, that might encourage people if we're waiving those upfront costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5638.675s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion or to ask the superintendent if we could look into doing that at this time, to waive CPR in first aid, <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5648.359s">I</a> mean, in fingerprinting costs, so that way we can entice more people to join the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5653.242s">Because</a> at the low rate of pay, it's probably a week or two of someone's salary that they're working.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=5681.754s">So</a> I'm going to make a motion at this point as to providing CPR at no cost and finger-pringing costs be provided for these before and after school programming people so we can make sure our staffing needs and our children's care is met.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6758.878s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6759.658s">That</a> was partially my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6761.259s">Yes,</a> you did, with the new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6766.059s">But</a> I have to say the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6769.838s">presented</a> to us recently her overview and what her plan is going to be and I was extremely impressed with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6781.54s">So</a> I'm glad that this is offered to new superintendents because without it they would be calling old superintendents and trying to piece work things and I think this is a really step-by-step process for them and <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6799.136s">making</a> the focus back on to the children in the curriculum in MCAF schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6805.141s">And</a> that's pretty much what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6808.744s">And</a> I know that I've given her some phone calls myself that probably have distracted her from that focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6816.15s">And</a> so these reminders are good for me as a school committee member as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6821.435s">And</a> I look forward to see what her goals are. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6823.736s">I'm</a> sure they'll be substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6828.411s">I</a> just want them to be realistic and attainable and hope that it's a successful beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6836.833s">I'm</a> very excited for what our community has in store with Dr. Edward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6876.138s">As</a> school committee members ourselves, I work in education, so there are some superintendents that I do call and ask <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6884.767s">you</a> know, policy procedures and how different areas and what they expect from their school committee members when they're coming forward to make sure that I'm in line, as well as with other school committee members who have no problem telling me when I'm in or out of line. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6905.982s">But</a> it's helpful to us as well to have that feedback and to have that collaboration and to see it <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6913.949s">in</a> this format is really, really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6918.83s">I</a> don't know who came up with the idea, but it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6922.531s">Rather</a> than floundering on their own and not making effective change the minute they come in, or not assessing things, and knowing where the strengths and the weaknesses of the current district are is extremely beneficial, not only to the superintendent, but all the way down to every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6940.818s">So</a> it's worth every penny from what I've seen so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6945.261s">I</a> look forward to what's presented to us over the next year or three, depending on how long we're all here.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6958.208s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6958.528s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=6960.709s">Of</a> course.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7703.128s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7703.828s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7704.588s">My</a> question, you kind of led into it, how does this program differentiate for students with special needs and our EL population? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7713.57s">And</a> are any of these teachers that are attending or doing these trainings <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7721.045s">piloting</a> the program EL or special education teachers?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7847.35s">And</a> the timeline for purchasing would be, at one point during this year, would we have to make the decision to pull the trigger and get all the supplies in for the beginning of next year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7895.478s">So</a> we'll raise the September. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7897.319s">You</a> know, like, if we could do training May or June, so that way when our teachers come back in September, we're not trying to teach them at the beginning of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7907.645s">They're</a> already come in prepared and ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=7909.486s">We</a> want to make sure we're going to go forward with it, though.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8467.393s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8468.914s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8469.975s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8471.095s">Mayor</a> Burke, can we make a motion to give the superintendent leeway to enter into negotiations with this company to purchase this and start training <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8482.87s">teachers</a> in April so that they're ready to begin with the materials for September 1.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8500.204s">Even</a> if we don't do any kits, we can make a contract and have the training start so our teachers, even without the manipulatives, <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8508.783s">Like</a> any training that they would come in and do in September, if we bought it in July 1st or early through the summer, if we could get that done before the teachers leave, then we're all setting up and running and we're not doing that training piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8522.566s">So</a> that's what we need to negotiate with the purchase of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8526.087s">We</a> need to push hard if they want to sell us the $250,000 program. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8532.828s">Like</a> we want our training done by June 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8536.323s">so</a> that way we're not doing it over the summer or in September.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8739.883s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8740.683s">Mr.</a> Bernadetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8741.984s">Do</a> we know how many homeschooled students we have in the district and how we check on those students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8795.516s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8796.416s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8902.386s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8903.287s">Excuse</a> me, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8905.197s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8905.977s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8906.437s">Also,</a> point of clarification, a student can move to another school district without withdrawing from a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8913.459s">And</a> until they're gone 10 days, you can't withdraw them so that September 6 was probably prior to us being open for 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8922.121s">So</a> there were students listed as absent that actually are going elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8927.023s">And</a> that's how we look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8929.563s">So</a> that's why there's an October 1 deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=8932.427s">the</a> reporting students to DESC, it gives you that first at least month for the district to work out its enrollment numbers before you report them, and then you're financially responsible for those ones from that point on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9376.29s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9377.17s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9378.611s">On</a> our reports, it's usually under number 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9382.792s">It</a> says requested reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9386.072s">There's</a> a few items I'd like added to that list for our next meeting, just so we all don't forget a few items. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9392.834s">I</a> think they got lost on the back sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9394.394s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9396.195s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9396.835s">So</a> my list would be PTO Friends of Registration Form updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9405.372s">when</a> that's going to be posted and who in the district's going to be responsible for upkeep of that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9416.076s">The</a> security report, an update on Lena DiGentimaso's plaque and ribbon-cutting disabilities awareness program that we talked about previously, just like <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9435.376s">maybe</a> the subcommittee needs to meet first on this with the special education programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9442.178s">We</a> were gonna check with Leslie to see if they had any programming that they could offer us as far as disability awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9449.94s">We</a> talked about that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9452.761s">Just</a> an update from the superintendent, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9457.922s">If</a> Leslie offers the disability awareness program, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9463.565s">It's</a> late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9465.726s">So</a> also an update from the payroll in January, just to keep it on the report, that it's requested January payroll update and an audit update as those items are completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9482.892s">And</a> the homeschool numbers that Bernadette Riccadeli offered to provide us. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9493.643s">Yeah,</a> the audit ends the January just as reminders like a like a tickler file so we don't forget in January they're supposed to report this these two reports so that way we as a committee don't lose track because we do so many things.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9514.85s">And</a> they usually write the date it was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9517.371s">And</a> then we can see how long it's been on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/psVhVz9ZIEQ&t=9519.992s">And</a> every once in a while, we look at it and say, hey, we should maybe loop back to that.<h2><a href="../2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM/2018-09-20_4DO7qbmEtOM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 17, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=923.278s">The</a> first item is, I saw Jenny Graham here and <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=927.605s">The</a> PTOs had a registration form that we created last year, and it's an online form. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=933.186s">And</a> we need to provide training to the PTOs and other organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=938.367s">So</a> I know it was an online form, and I'm not sure that the superintendent is aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=943.388s">And</a> all of those organizations are supposed to register by, I can't remember if it was October 1st or mid-October. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=950.729s">And</a> since that is very soon, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=954.035s">I</a> didn't know if Jenny could come up and just refresh our mind about what she presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=958.579s">I</a> remember being very impressed with the online form and how we were going about it, and exactly which groups are responsible for filling them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=969.327s">I</a> didn't remember everything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1222.961s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1224.381s">Also,</a> as a follow-up, I think it was pretty sure that we mandated all that used the method public schools as part of their fundraising in any way had to do the training and had to register their group in order to use our buildings, to allocate, to raise money, in any way, shape, or form, <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1248.051s">I</a> totally forgot that and it just came flooding back to me when Ginny was sitting in the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=1254.454s">So</a> that's why I brought it up, but I didn't want it to lose it again.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2288.879s">Mustang</a> blue all the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=2290.32s">Good</a> choice.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3119.912s">That's</a> what I was going to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3121.213s">These</a> people are continually in front of us making donations to the students in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3126.878s">And</a> I would like to send a thank you note as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3130.18s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3298.703s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3300.523s">Could</a> you give us an idea of the cost involved for a breakfast or a lunch? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3304.904s">Just</a> so the community knows what to bring in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3307.025s">Is</a> it cash only?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3332.243s">And</a> will all of that be on the website so people can check it out ahead of time?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3349.995s">Oh,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3350.676s">While</a> all the teachers, they can grab their breakfast and go.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3379.846s">Has</a> that been advertised at all to the community or to the parents?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3801.254s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3802.114s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3802.875s">I'm</a> very happy to see the professional development opportunities for our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3810.54s">So</a> when I met with the special education PAC leader over the summer, they're hoping to have a disability awareness program. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3820.727s">And</a> I didn't know if there was a possibility that Leslie may already have something that we could use. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3828.226s">for</a> our teaching staff or our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3831.427s">And</a> rather than create it from a lot of outside places, we can see, since we already have this partnership, if they already have something developed that we could share. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3841.41s">I'm</a> hoping to reach out to the other members of this subcommittee soon and see if we can make a meeting at that time, a meeting sometime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3852.233s">And</a> I'm wondering if a liaison from Leslie, if they have <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3858.093s">anything</a> could possibly attend?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3880.304s">We're</a> still at the beginning basis and gathering information of what that program will look like and where we get it from to bring it in? <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3887.74s">So</a> if Leslie already has some type of programming available and that we can utilize that without costing the district with this partnership, it would save us some money and time from looking and we can move forward on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3903.748s">I'll</a> talk to you directly more about it, but I think that these types of partnerships are gonna become very helpful for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=3914.653s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4538.143s">As</a> chairsperson of the curriculum subcommittee, I'd like to move this item to subcommittee and have that meeting soon after the release of the MCAS so we can go over those district reports prior to them being discussed at our school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4557.868s">I</a> know that MCAS are released in December for last year, I mean October. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4563.952s">So</a> last year, so once those items are released, maybe we can incorporate all assessments and how we're looking at where children are and where, what our next steps are and go over that at a subcommittee meeting and have a bigger conversation since this seems like it's an important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4581.703s">So</a> I motion to speak about this and that at a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4587.206s">Member</a> Ruseau is also a member. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4589.718s">And</a> member Rogerio is also a member of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4593.739s">So</a> I'd like to move this item to subcommittee.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4880.414s">Also,</a> the other report that we received recently had some recommendations for the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4885.358s">So</a> maybe they could be added to that committee meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4888.543s">with</a> Safe Haven's report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4896.73s">Right,</a> I saw a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4DO7qbmEtOM&t=4899.212s">So</a> maybe they could be added to that agenda of that subcommittee.<h2><a href="../2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ/2018-09-13_HY2bBQvmkEQ.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 6, 2018</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=28.689s">That's</a> a miscellaneous gifts and refund account for the scholarship limb prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=35.377s">Okay,</a> and there was another one that also had another $1,000, so that was later in, so it's probably another scholarship, and that was on page 20 of 40, and the second one from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=61.813s">And</a> what was the amount of that, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=63.614s">Again,</a> $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=66.012s">It's</a> the very bottom of the page, the second one up, it says pending classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=70.114s">Yes,</a> that is the same account, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=72.075s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=73.356s">So</a> my next question was, sorry, on, oh, that was the duplicate payment to someplace, so you already rectified that by giving us a new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=87.923s">Another</a> question I had was on page 25 of 40. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=92.345s">and</a> it's dated July 23rd, and it's for $625.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=97.189s">It's</a> the fifth one up from the bottom, and it says school committee superintendents choose Beverly Nelson, but Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=106.597s">Nelson</a> retired prior to that date.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=118.935s">Are</a> we paying for the dues for the year for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=121.438s">Nelson</a> as well as Mr. Nelson?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=130.786s">Okay,</a> thank you for clearing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=133.228s">I</a> believe that was my last question, and thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1367.719s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, I heard that Dr. Maurice might have ridden the school bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1373.761s">She</a> did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1374.441s">I</a> heard that too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1376.902s">Word</a> got around town very quickly that you were on the school bus.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1415.21s">Oh,</a> I'm sure they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1416.17s">I</a> just wanted to know if you started a sing-along while you were on the bus.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1427.127s">It</a> impressed our community to a point where I was getting phone calls that you were on the bus and that's a great way to start the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1434.857s">I</a> have high hopes for all our remaining days to go as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=1440.745s">Thank</a> you for that.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2029.363s">So</a> with regards to that, I'm still hoping that all schools can get their windows washed at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2035.144s">That's</a> a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2036.124s">And</a> maybe we can maybe get some bids this year so we can arrange for that to happen in the spring, because I think it will make a big difference in every building. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2046.006s">I</a> know it's probably going to be a big cost, or we're going to have to do it in-house with the right equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2050.827s">I</a> know it's not an easy job.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2069.449s">Yeah,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2071.93s">My</a> next question was about the high school pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2074.551s">I</a> know there were some issues with that, and maybe you could update us as to where we are with that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2080.874s">Is</a> that open?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2113.734s">So</a> I was like, oh, this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2115.616s">So</a> could, not directed to you, but could we get an update on the costs involved, and what was done, and how long it does, and any maintenance issues that we're gonna make sure that we're okay for that for future. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2128.886s">I</a> know the pool was just done six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2130.788s">I</a> just wanna make sure we maintain that, because we did put a couple million dollars into that project, and we wanna make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2137.374s">we're</a> maintaining the things that we're investing in.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2142.956s">For</a> six years to have no issues is a really good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2145.556s">And</a> it gets used.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2159.18s">Thank</a> you for addressing some of our early childhood students' air conditioning needs, because that was requested <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2165.569s">like</a> two or three years ago, you and I had, well, you had done some good work over there, and I'm glad to see that continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2172.777s">As</a> well as the Curtis Tufts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2176.121s">I</a> can't wait till every floor is that beautiful golden oak and not that darker color. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2182.808s">I</a> know you haven't forgotten about that building, and I appreciate that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2198.229s">I</a> just wanted to acknowledge those things and just make sure that the beautification that happened outside the schools with the mulch and the flowers, that really makes people happy walking into the building, not just the people who work there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2211.735s">The</a> people who work there, the children that attend there, their families, and it's the <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2216.15s">first</a> and last thing people see when they're walking through our doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2219.292s">So</a> I'd like to continue with that being a priority with our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2224.875s">I</a> do have another question about how the money for the turf field came about, because it just wasn't clear to me as a member how that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2237.521s">So</a> I don't know if that's a question for the mayor or the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=2244.208s">I'm</a> not familiar with the linkage account and what that does.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3113.028s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3113.869s">I'd</a> actually like to give the floor to Cheryl before I speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3120.65s">I</a> attended a lot of the CPA, CPC meetings with her to support her through this whole thing, but since she's the originator, I yield to her and to what she wants to present and why the amount was $109,000 to begin with and how we've <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3138.075s">you</a> know, just open the conversation up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=3143.397s">Before</a> I do that, I'd just like to acknowledge that we have a city councillor in the room, Brianna Mwango-Cohen, and she's also here, and she's also been a strong supporter of this program and many other school programs, so I just wanna acknowledge that she is in the audience, and maybe she can, at some point, if we do need to expedite things, help us in that manner if she sees fit.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4039.696s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4040.957s">At</a> the beginning, the CPA was very careful about what they were awarding and exactly how much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4047.12s">And</a> the quotes, the amount of money presented to the CPA was based on a quote that Cheryl had from the same company to do it, because they wanted us to keep the price down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4062.187s">They</a> didn't want to spend $200,000 for this project or allocate that money.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4067.957s">So</a> my point is that I don't know going back to them, asking them for more money on this project is going to work from what I've seen and what I, I stood there with Cheryl and answered their questions and they were very cautious about how much money they were giving us towards this ground coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4086.077s">And</a> this was told to us that it was a one time thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4088.9s">They</a> weren't going to do all the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4090.605s">And</a> they wanted the square products. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4092.587s">They</a> were specific about what products we had to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4095.129s">They</a> were specific about how much they were going to allocate to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4099.113s">So</a> even my concern is going through this whole process through October might not get us the extra money from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4106.621s">And</a> then where are we? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4109.666s">Initially,</a> I believe, John gave some of the names of contractors to get quotes to Cheryl, and that's the companies that she's presenting those figures to you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4123.114s">So</a> it wasn't like she went out and got them aimlessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4126.095s">The</a> school— No, no, I'm just filling in that blank. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=4129.637s">It's</a> not like she went off to a company that we have no known knowledge.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5305.078s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5305.818s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5309.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5310.34s">So</a> initially when this was presented to the CPA and we were allocated these funds, this was what we had because that's what we needed to have and that was the scope of work we were looking to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5325.507s">So</a> I don't know how it, if it changed and it got more elaborate, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5330.192s">when</a> it went to the bidding process, but this was our pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5334.88s">This</a> was to see if this stuff worked in our schools before we did the big McGlynn-Andrews <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5343.515s">because</a> it's huge, in other schools in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5346.538s">This</a> was piloting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5347.979s">We</a> were getting this money not from the school department, but from every taxpayer in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5353.864s">We</a> want to make sure that this is the right product to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5357.426s">We</a> want to make sure that these children have a chance to run and play in a safe area. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5362.851s">I</a> believe the intent <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5364.972s">of</a> this project is awesome and great and we should move forward with what we initially applied for and received. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5373.016s">And</a> if we can do it with the CPA funds and move quickly, I think we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5378.019s">And</a> I make a motion to move forward with this project as it was initially brought forward not only to this committee, to the school department, but to the CPA and just move forward for the best interest of the children.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5409.655s">So</a> we can do it pending their approval?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=5653.694s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6193.457s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6194.338s">To</a> speak of the air conditioning issue, I had spoken to Dr. Edouard-Vincent earlier in the week about the possibility of moving the school, the out of school time camp, the summer fun camp back to <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6209.589s">The</a> Columbus School and the children used to walk to the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6212.551s">So</a> I was giving her some history of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6214.532s">So</a> there is still a pool accessible, and it did work there for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6220.215s">And</a> based on the heat, and if we can't fix the issue by next summer, I think that, you know, that is a strong possibility for that location again. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6230.361s">But</a> since Melanie came forward and spoke a little bit about the special education path, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6237.833s">I</a> wanted to request information from the committee on who is on the subcommittee for the special education subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6247.036s">I</a> know I'm the chairperson, and I know we announced it at the end of last year, and I didn't catch the names of the other members, because I would like to call for a meeting within the next two weeks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6260.361s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6261.901s">That</a> would be terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6263.502s">I</a> did have an opportunity just to follow up to meet <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6267.752s">with</a> Melanie a few weeks ago and just prioritize a few issues to be discussed at that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6275.615s">So</a> we would like to move forward with that quickly, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6279.156s">So</a> your help with that would be very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6281.577s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6283.658s">Secondly,</a> I'd like to know where those air conditioners maybe went. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6291.501s">And</a> so that way, if we do need them in the next week or two, because we are still <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6295.968s">I</a> know the heat wave's supposed to break tomorrow, but it could come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6299.47s">So,</a> I mean, there's probably areas that really could use them if we could look around. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6304.053s">Or</a> do we wanna consider that AC fundraiser? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6309.917s">I</a> know it's a draw on electrical and it caused other issues, but we need to look outside the box sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6316.402s">And</a> people coming forward with ideas and outside the box is beneficial to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6321.885s">So</a> I don't wanna just like, okay, we couldn't find them and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6325.881s">Let's</a> figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6328.061s">Also,</a> not only is the summer fun program an issue, I would like to see unification of our out of school time programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6337.483s">So</a> it would be the morning before school programming, the after school programming, the week long camp programming, and the summer programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6346.625s">I'd</a> like to look at that as one big program and make sure that we have great staff and great curriculum and great things for children to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6355.73s">But</a> I also want to make sure that it's deliberate and it's inclusional to students that are EL students as well as special education students or any other students with needs, financial or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6368.613s">So</a> I would like to, I don't know which committee that should go under, but I really would like to work on that through this year and really build an excellent programming because our job as <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6380.272s">community</a> members, and as teachers, and as administrators, and as mayor, is to serve our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6385.573s">And</a> there's a great need for our community, because most parents are working parents, for this out-of-school time, educational piece, care piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6395.075s">And</a> I think it's building every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6397.175s">And</a> we're not meeting the needs of our community currently, because the staffing, because our program hasn't grown as big as our need has. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6405.617s">And</a> I really would like to, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6408.828s">work</a> with different people in the community, not just school people, but people in the community who want to volunteer and invest in making this a great thing for our school system and our community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6421.654s">So</a> I don't know which subcommittee should take that on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6428.275s">I</a> really would like to work on that personally, Mayor Burke, so maybe you could put some thought into that while you're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6434.999s">Yeah,</a> thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6437.201s">And</a> one last thing, since we're on suspension of rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6440.223s">We're</a> still on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6441.363s">Okay,</a> when we're done, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6443.745s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6492.566s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6494.687s">The</a> dedication of the band room. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6496.368s">I</a> know I discussed it with former superintendent and Mayor Burke last year about dedicating the band, the possibility of dedicating the band room to Lina Gigentomaso, who was a 30 year school committee member who really advocated for the, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6514.817s">those</a> students in the fine arts department in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6518.439s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6591.931s">I</a> agree in following that, and I want to do it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6596.573s">Timing</a> would be good to move forward quicker than not. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6602.515s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6604.536s">And</a> it was requested, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6608.29s">last</a> year through the superintendent and the mayor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6612.112s">It</a> wasn't on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6613.413s">It</a> wasn't on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6614.253s">Let's</a> do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6615.694s">I</a> asked them to look into it months ago.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6639.648s">Maybe</a> we could have it before the meeting and then bring it to the floor that night?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6665.204s">So</a> I'd like to respectfully request that if we do need to have a committee of the whole, that we could do that prior to the next meeting, like right an hour before, and then go into the meeting, and if so warranted by our committee, move forward with it at that meeting and vote it on, so that way it can take place <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6683.984s">on</a> the following meeting, which would be?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6693.657s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6696.922s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=6700.687s">Very</a> good.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7026.406s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7026.506s">It</a> will be.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7031.236s">That</a> was one of my questions, is when that will be presented to the school committee, as well as, is the bistro open?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7272.463s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7273.523s">It's</a> really good for us to see where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7276.084s">There</a> are a few areas of concern to me, as far as numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7280.747s">In</a> Medford, we like to keep them down and low, and we've been successful in doing that for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7286.274s">So</a> the area that looks a little high to me, the Roberts Kindergarten classes with 22, that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7293.236s">I'm</a> just hoping, do they have full-time aides in those classrooms on all four of those?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7314.351s">Okay,</a> and what about EL students that aren't in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7317.154s">Are</a> they counted in there?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7322.439s">Okay,</a> so my other concern in that same school is the third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7326.943s">They</a> only have three third grade classes, and they're all 22 and 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7333.249s">If</a> more students were to matriculate to that school, those numbers wouldn't,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7368.087s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7369.862s">I</a> just like to highlight that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7371.422s">My</a> other question is, when parents fill out emergency cards and parent information, a couple of parents have told me that they've filled out these cards a few times now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7386.125s">And</a> isn't it done electronically? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7388.065s">Don't</a> we have school brains? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7389.285s">Does</a> the parent portal for the school brains work? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7391.806s">And</a> don't parents go online? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7394.126s">I</a> know at our school, all parents register online, and if they don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7398.745s">access</a> to that, we have special nights for parents to come in and we help them do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7403.187s">So</a> that way, if a new student's added or, you know, if you need a class list, you can print it out on, you know, as a teacher, it's helpful, and has emergency contact information on one sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7416.974s">And</a> parents aren't required to fill out those little cards over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7421.617s">Yeah,</a> I'm not sure what the little cards are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7541.758s">Well,</a> my point is that we invested all this money into this programming that has so many options. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7547.183s">And</a> I think it's good for us to move forward in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7550.566s">And</a> it's more convenient for most parents now. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7557.333s">And</a> of course, there are going to be some parents that need assistance with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7560.736s">But</a> you could have assistance night or registration night and help them with the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7565.461s">And</a> then you're also educating them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7567.273s">because</a> as children get older, they use that for homework assignments, they use that for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7571.717s">So</a> starting that in the beginning and moving forward in that direction is really where I want to see us moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7578.962s">Plus,</a> you know, we have parents, you know, filling out so many things repeatedly, the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7584.727s">If</a> you have three kids and you're given that form three times, that's nine times you're filling out the same information and it gets, I got a call about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7594.074s">Also,</a> Parent Information Center, <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7596.666s">I</a> talked to the superintendent quite a bit this summer about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7602.05s">I</a> had a family member go through the process, so I got like a bird's eye view. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7607.134s">I</a> would like to streamline that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7608.675s">I</a> would like to have some way, and our superintendent's on it, and I just wanna commend her for her responsiveness to not only my questions, but people's needs there, as well as maybe the EL department in talking to them about <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7626.44s">really</a> having some way to welcome families and help them through that process as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7655.352s">Yeah,</a> and even through the summer, I think it's really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7658.434s">And</a> maybe opening different times for working parents, because our community is changing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7684.726s">And</a> I also want to support the people that are working there. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7687.429s">I</a> don't want to, you know, fry them because they spend good time talking to each parent to make sure that they're onboarded well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7695.972s">and</a> I just, that's our parents' first step into our community, so we really need to do that well, we need to present that well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7704.315s">And</a> again, I just want to commend people for the work they've done and just keep moving forward to getting that better as we serve our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=7713.138s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8501.663s">Thank</a> you for offering that to our EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8503.984s">I</a> know it was the first year for that program, and then I heard about it, and children and families were very pleased that they had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8512.166s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8513.607s">My</a> other question is, did our vocational programming offer any summer programming? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8519.809s">Sometimes</a> they do that for eighth graders to get them interested in different things coming up to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8526.491s">So</a> I'm not sure if that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8527.852s">I</a> didn't see it on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8529.402s">But</a> I believe in years past that those programs were offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8533.744s">So</a> maybe we could get an update on that and find out if that was offered this year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8546.992s">I'm</a> just curious how many students are taking place.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8553.375s">Yeah,</a> I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8554.836s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8555.517s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8556.677s">Thank</a> you, Diane.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8940.384s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8941.004s">I</a> did get one call. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8942.885s">It</a> was only one call. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8943.845s">It's</a> two students that are on one side of the street, and the bus goes around very far to pick them up rather than letting the students cross the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8952.548s">It's</a> up near Grove or Salt and Saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8954.988s">I</a> don't know that area very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8956.149s">It's</a> for safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8957.589s">I'm</a> sure it's a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8959.149s">I</a> don't know if they've talked to you directly about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8961.509s">Other</a> than that, it's a great start because usually I get a lot of calls or emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8967.393s">If</a> they were to speak with you, maybe there was some way that we could look at that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8974.157s">And</a> my other question is the late bus that the Columbus School, because they had the, I know we added it at the end of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8982.362s">I</a> just want to make sure that those students have that opportunity again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8987.305s">Remember</a> they were staying late? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=8988.806s">That</a> was a special program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9008.344s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9009.324s">I</a> thought it met a couple different needs over there, but if it does arise, we'll talk about it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9015.006s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9015.406s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9326.676s">Move</a> the bus stop up or down a street? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9331.538s">We'll</a> review all the options on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9333.818s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9535.555s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9536.355s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9538.176s">I</a> was gonna motion to accept it, but my colleagues already have, but could we also send a letter of thank you to the Palumbo family for this kind donation <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9550.149s">It</a> looks like it's going to continue for years to come.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9570.789s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9643.436s">And</a> there's no conflict since they are a renter of that particular school, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.239s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.319s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9648.819s">I</a> just wanted to check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9650.22s">And</a> is this just specifically for the McGlynn, or is it for the district as a whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9657.505s">The</a> district. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9659.352s">Thank</a> you, motion to approve and letter sent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9805.479s">Our</a> vocational program has a retail program, so why couldn't we look at that as being part of their programming? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9815.524s">The</a> DECA program, the DECA? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9817.465s">Like</a> the marketing and retail, don't we have?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9822.547s">Yeah,</a> and why can't they sell, why can't we order the school supplies in a similar way and open that up, you know, certain hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9833.221s">at</a> the beginning of the school year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9845.085s">I</a> thought that the vocational school, they sell things at a lower level, but there are also kids in that program all the way up through 12th grade that, you know, ordering those supplies and giving them those life skills to manage a situation in that <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9860.96s">might</a> be worth looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9862.901s">I</a> mean, that's what we're hoping to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9864.542s">And</a> this is a real-life practice gum, and it would be supervised by that shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9871.305s">So</a> I don't see why not at least discuss that as a possibility with Chad, the director there, and just look at it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9897.604s">Even</a> if we start small and then grow it, at least we're offering, like, hey, get all your notebooks here instead of at Staples, or all your binders, and just start small and then grow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9907.872s">I</a> mean, it's a life lesson for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9911.374s">Our</a> student advocate is here, and we would like to speak.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9956.871s">You</a> could even set up shop at a different spot seasonally. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9966.636s">They</a> set up kiosks and malls. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9970.418s">Space</a> isn't, I don't think, prohibitive of at least looking at the idea of this in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9979.918s">even</a> if it's a small way that we can help our community and serve the need of our community in their wallets and teach our students at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=9990.043s">I</a> think it's a growth opportunity that at least should be looked at by the people in that, you know, by the principal of that area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10308.176s">So</a> may I work? <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10310.977s">A</a> few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10311.637s">First</a> of all, my husband's a union carpenter in Boston and has been for 38 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10317.82s">And</a> he said that throughout the community, they're struggling to bring in younger people into the trades and talented people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10328.047s">We</a> really need to communicate to people in the community the value of these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10333.989s">And</a> these men and women make six figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10336.949s">I</a> mean, they make a great living, and they provide well for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10342.611s">And</a> Medford was built on the backs of hardworking people from the trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10348.973s">We</a> were shipbuilders in the beginning, and our commitment to our vocational school in the last few years has been exceptional. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10357.663s">I</a> would really hate to see programming close, so it's appeal to people in the community that might hear this, and maybe to our newspaper to get out the word that Method really wants to offer strong programming to our students, and we need people in the community to step up and help us in any way they can, even if it's, I don't know, if it's <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10385.422s">current</a> companies or graduates that graduated from the HVAC program at vocational school coming back to teach students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10393.965s">And</a> even if we have to offer some of those in the evening instead of the day, I mean, we might have to look outside the box to fill these needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10403.388s">And</a> I really don't want to start outsourcing back to Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10408.65s">We</a> used to pay a million dollars a year in tuition to Minuteman, and then we were left with no money to invest <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10414.598s">of</a> vocational programming, and we've come so far to offering great programming and great education to all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10424.063s">So</a> this, to me, is almost an emergency situation, and we have to work as a team, and I will contact some friends in the industry and see if they can help in any way, and I suggest that all of us do that, and anyone listening that could offer any help to please call us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10442.338s">This</a> is a great way for a lot of students to move forward in their career. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10446.639s">Children</a> who, you know, college isn't the right choice for them or students that are gonna do both, trade in and college. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10455.662s">I</a> mean, there are so many opportunities here and our community needs this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10460.063s">So</a> it's just a dire emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10462.384s">I'd</a> also like to know a little ahead of time when we're having these type of issues, maybe earlier in the summer, a quick email or an alert so that we can help <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10472.719s">in</a> any way we can as committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10475.642s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HY2bBQvmkEQ&t=10476.102s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8/2018-06-19_kF4MfjuZkZ8.html">Medford School Committee meeting June 18, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=422.655s">I</a> just had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=426.876s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=427.756s">On</a> page 5 of 18, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=430.572s">A</a> little bit more than halfway down, it says, lost books, iPads, and deductibles in the amount of $464.71. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=437.435s">I</a> don't know if you know what that was for. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=438.836s">Page</a> 5 of 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=441.397s">A</a> little bit, teeny bit more than halfway down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=444.919s">Anthony</a> Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=445.359s">So</a> that would be, if you found the page, why is it still on? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=448.14s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=448.38s">I</a> didn't ask about that.

href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1652.708s">I</a> received a text today from a new parent who works throughout the Commonwealth in and out of schools all the time, and this is the text that I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1664.016s">I'm</a> really impressed by the security measures at Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1669.484s">I've</a> been to four schools and each one has been excellent, much better than other districts I've visited. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1674.968s">I'm</a> really critical about security and you are doing very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1679.732s">So</a> I thought I'd start off on a positive note and just tell you that the changes that we're making, parents are seeing them and they appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1691.762s">Because</a> they need to know that their child are entering a building in a safe environment and <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1697.19s">Having</a> those monitors at the doors, really, this new parent, she's been to the high school for the Parent Information Center, to the Columbus School, to many, many schools already. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1707.574s">And</a> she has nothing but good things to say about the Method Public Schools so far in her experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1715.336s">So</a> I just thought I'd share that and say, you know, with everything going on, there are a lot of positive things happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1723.079s">So</a> that's the positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1726.82s">First</a> of all, thank you for financing the band travel, because if we're financing all the travel for the athletics, we should be financing all the travel for our music students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1739.332s">So</a> that's greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1740.933s">Thank</a> you for taking care of that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1743.155s">And</a> I'm sure as more people retire and people are replaced, more finances will be found to add different things in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1752.297s">throughout</a> up until September. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1753.958s">I</a> know you usually say that to us, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1758.021s">I'm</a> very happy to see additional textbooks added back to the elementary schools of $1,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1763.944s">They</a> were cut $2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1765.625s">It's</a> a good step. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1767.927s">I</a> really want to watch closely and make sure that the students and the books are in good shape for children to take home. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1777.913s">And</a> hopefully that $1,000 cut <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1781.224s">Her</a> elementary school won't affect them too drastically. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1786.486s">The</a> crew program, I can't complain there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1789.167s">My</a> son was one of the first members to row for Method Crew, and he won the first medal for Method Crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1796.39s">And</a> I think at some point, he'd like to donate it to the case up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1800.952s">So</a> we did find that recently, and we saved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1803.473s">So</a> I'll give that to you, Mayberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1805.474s">Maybe</a> you can help me with making that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1811.788s">When</a> we saw the amount of money spent on our athletics, some sports cost more than others, and maybe that's something down the road we'll look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1824.375s">But</a> I'm really grateful that we have over 600 children involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1829.097s">And</a> a lot of those children also are involved in band and orchestra, and they do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1835.44s">So</a> it affects a lot of children throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1840.537s">Fourth</a> grade on, they get to play musical instruments, even recorders before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1845.56s">But</a> we have great programming both in the athletics and the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1851.363s">I'm</a> glad to see you adjusted the principal salaries so that they seem fair and equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1858.407s">So</a> everybody's on the same line item because we made great measures years ago to make sure that stayed that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1868.264s">And</a> then I really, my problem with the budget is a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1873.726s">The</a> first is the lack of kindergarten aids, especially as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1877.907s">We</a> have for years voiced our concern, and I don't feel like it's been heard or listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1883.949s">Or</a> maybe it was heard and just not the same priority as the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1888.27s">I</a> can respect disagreeing on certain things, but <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1893.871s">Consistently,</a> this committee has voiced concerns of that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1898.313s">I</a> would have liked to have seen that fixed in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1904.075s">The</a> maintenance and repairs decrease of 6% seems really crazy to me when I see needs in our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1912.059s">And</a> I talked about it at our committee of the whole meeting, just shades alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1916.741s">You</a> could do a little bit every year with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1920.722s">And</a> they're necessary not only to stop the glare so teachers can teach and people can see the boards, it's also for security reasons when you're in lockdown and shutdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1933.548s">That's</a> a major issue too, because if you can't pull the outside shade and you're in the first floor, someone on the outside of the building can see into the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1942.112s">So</a> I do have concerns with cutting maintenance and repairs at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1949.005s">If</a> anything, I would like to see more maintenance and more repairs as our buildings age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1955.289s">And</a> those are my biggest issues, and I'm going to yield to other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1960.272s">I</a> don't want to go on and on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1963.074s">I</a> do think that there was an error this year in the transfer of funds from the budget book. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1971.779s">I</a> think that somehow, at the beginning of last year, <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1976.555s">The</a> line item was $10,000 difference for the vocational school in one area and $5,000 in a different area. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1983.078s">And</a> I noticed it at our budget meeting because I had both the previous years and this year's book open. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1988.401s">So</a> it might have been lost through the 17-18 school year and then not carried over. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=1994.604s">But</a> it was in the 17-18 book that they should have carried over $70,000 and $60,000 was carried over. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2003.116s">I</a> spoke with the superintendent and he said it was never allocated to them for 17-18. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2008.457s">So</a> that's why it said 60 this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2011.197s">I</a> think it was a loss of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2012.558s">17-18</a> and another loss this year because not only did they go from the 70 to the 60, they're going down again from the 60. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2023.44s">And</a> I just want to pull up the page so I make sure I get the correct information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2029.541s">They</a> were cut from 60 to 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2032.249s">So</a> in the last, they're losing 15,000 in that line item, and the same thing happened with their textbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2039.61s">It</a> was supposed to be 15,000 carried over. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2043.051s">So</a> I just feel like we need to look at that, and if adjustments need to be made throughout the school year, that they don't have enough money for their instructional supplies, especially out of vocation, because you need lab supplies for biotech. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2061.102s">You</a> need shop supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2063.023s">You</a> need iron for the tin lockers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2067.207s">You</a> need carpentry supplies and some of the equipment as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2072.671s">There's</a> a big cut in vocational budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2077.054s">My</a> husband's a union carpenter, and he's been up at the vocational school, and he sees that a lot of the shops are still using old machinery and need to be upgraded to see cuts in these areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2090.265s">is</a> really very difficult for, it's not in the best interest of the education of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2098.167s">So</a> those are my main issues with this budget and it's very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2103.289s">So</a> based on some of the things I see, I don't see me voting for this budget in the way that it's presented.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2995.796s">Point</a> of information, Mr. Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2997.757s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2998.258s">A</a> little bit of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=2999.418s">I'm</a> the homeless coordinator for another district. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3005.162s">So</a> this issue I brought up over the last few years <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3010.342s">And</a> when I was running for state representative, this was an issue that I was going to work on at the House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3020.264s">When</a> I didn't get elected, I sat down with Christine Barber, who is our state representative, and she brought the issue before the House. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3030.166s">And</a> it was unanimously approved for a commission to study this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3038.013s">And</a> that was approved maybe close to three years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3043.277s">So</a> I've been recently talking to Pat Jalen and Christine Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3048.66s">Actually,</a> Christine texted me yesterday to discuss this commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3054.204s">And</a> I also spoke with someone who has the ear of the governor and asked him to bring the commission forward instead of appointing it, and how I really want a seat on that commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3068.783s">And</a> my goal and my dedication to this is to sit on that commission and make changes not only in homeless transportation, but to have a directory of homeless families so that homeless children are placed closer to the communities that they lived in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3085.775s">So</a> yes, we talked about this a little bit at our last meeting, and I talked about my colleagues working with me on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3095.577s">really</a> believe that that commission is our next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3099.818s">I'm</a> totally for your motion to try things that way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3105.76s">And</a> I want to know who's making the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3108.54s">I</a> want to follow the money and see who's getting rich. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3111.101s">Because</a> we pay, I'm not sure how much Medford pays, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3114.762s">$260</a> a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3115.122s">I</a> like to break it down a day per child to drive them to and from a shelter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3126.543s">Sometimes</a> less if there's two kids in a car or a family of children, then it could be like 160 per child per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3134.226s">With</a> that amount of money, you could rent them an apartment, buy their clothes and their food, and really take care of them in a lot of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3143.83s">But</a> that's not legislated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3146.03s">And</a> the only way we're going to change this is through legislation and through active participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3151.993s">And</a> I really believe that that's the method that I choose to work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3155.909s">But</a> I'll support you in your motion to move forward in this way as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3889.882s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3891.443s">So</a> the superintendent's idea that we do vote for the bottom line of the budget, yes, we vote for the bottom line of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3899.307s">But</a> we also have been asking and giving our priorities over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3904.129s">And</a> I don't think that this budget reflects the priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3908.27s">The</a> maintenance, we walked every building a couple years ago and made a list that we still have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3914.354s">We've</a> talked repeatedly about the importance of the foundation of education in kindergarten age. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3920.958s">So</a> the list, like the capital budget list, who's giving, is it coming to us or created by us? <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3928.282s">Because</a> this budget came to us, it wasn't created by us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3931.564s">Because</a> I feel like our priorities aren't in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3936.249s">This</a> has been drafted and given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3939.012s">And</a> we can just verbally say, well, we wish we had this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3943.337s">Well,</a> I'm voting on what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3946.22s">And</a> I'm voting on kindergarten aides and maintenance cuts and vocational cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3953.928s">And</a> because those priorities are my priorities and the priorities of the people I represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3958.997s">And</a> they wouldn't want me to vote on a bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3961.538s">They</a> wanted me to make sure that the things that are important to them are in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3965.679s">And</a> if they're not, they want me to vote not, not on a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3969.46s">So</a> that's how I vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3970.68s">I</a> don't interpret it the same way as the superintendent has presented it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=3974.241s">So</a> that, that, I just wanted to clarify that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4373.567s">Item</a> two. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4374.827s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4376.027s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4378.153s">It</a> reminded me of a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4381.596s">We</a> spoke a little bit at our last meeting about the Roberts School ground cover for the playground, and I was just wondering if it was sent out for it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4399.389s">I</a> think they said this morning.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4404.393s">No,</a> no, no, no, no.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/kF4MfjuZkZ8&t=4406.939s">Oh,</a> okay, you wouldn't know.<h2><a href="../2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI/2018-05-25_gwIgYT_iFzI.html">City Council Meeting 05/22/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6844.508s">Erin</a> DiBenedetto, 21 Dearborn Street, and also a member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6850.152s">I'm</a> here because Cheryl brought this forward through CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6854.648s">It</a> is on your agenda, so we're not asking for something, for you to vote on something that's not already on your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6860.172s">It's</a> on your agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6861.432s">The</a> information, this program was approved by CPA funds and is coming before you tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6868.417s">So</a> they're coming to you as a group packet, and we didn't know that this item was going to be tabled until your committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6876.442s">So</a> I respectfully ask you to vote on this one issue while you have the applicant in front of you can answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6884.951s">All</a> of this is gonna be managed through the administration at Medford High School and the Building and Grounds Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6891.756s">If</a> bids need to be made, they need to go out, so the timing for those has to be appropriated as well as, you know, that's gonna slow down our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6901.384s">Our</a> goal here is to make sure that it's safe for our children to return to that playground day one in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6908.37s">And</a> that's our only goal for asking you <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6910.741s">to</a> move forward with your agenda item that you have before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6913.963s">And</a> any information I can help with or the applicant can help with, Cheryl Rodriguez, we're here to answer any and all questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=6921.566s">And</a> I just ask for your consideration for this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7607.133s">Our</a> hope was to have this process already be completed, so we were hoping to be up and running before any child came back onto that school yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7615.838s">Now</a> that we thought this CPA money was going at our last CPA meeting, which was, <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7623.615s">We</a> thought it was gonna come before this board much sooner, so we hadn't had those discussions as to whether we would wait a whole year or we would try to do it around the school children. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7635.38s">That's</a> gonna be very difficult, especially at that time of the year with outdoor recess and really giving children the opportunity to be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7645.624s">We've</a> all known and we've toured many of the school playgrounds and that <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7651.854s">they're</a> in, they've been patched, they've been, their lifetime has, this is a pilot program for all of our schools, and this issue has to be addressed for the safety of the children, and it's a community project as well, because there are so many children in that neighborhood that use it as their parking into the evenings for working parents as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7688.205s">Ten</a> days.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7868.92s">I</a> just want to thank you for hearing us this evening and even the consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7873.042s">I</a> also want to publicly thank Cheryl Rodriguez for all the time and effort, 65 page application, multiple meetings, at least 10 that I know of, and I've attended as many as I can to help be supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7888.523s">the</a> school community is gonna really benefit because of all the work that she's done, and she should be commended for her work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gwIgYT_iFzI&t=7897.549s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s/2018-05-23_OW5zlwQpW0s.html">Medford School Committee Meeting May 21, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=590.134s">I</a> was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=646.597s">So</a> will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.558s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1193.778s">Benedetto?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1194.839s">First</a> of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1207.063s">The</a> colored pictures, really knowing all your facts, and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that emotional peace home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1219.668s">I</a> just wanted this time to motion to approve <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1223.471s">the</a> apple orchard and all the other fruit at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1231.095s">I</a> think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=1241.159s">So,</a> at this time, I make that motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2172.808s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2174.198s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2174.938s">Diane,</a> we were talking recently about after school and before school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2181.461s">Were</a> there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2187.864s">Are</a> we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2231.36s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2232.261s">We</a> did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2243.246s">So</a> we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2284.942s">And</a> when would we know and be able to tell parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2289.065s">Because</a> I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2733.501s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2734.641s">I'm</a> really glad that we were able to offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2737.202s">This</a> came about because of MCAF scores, and was there any, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2743.98s">growth,</a> any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2793.663s">Also,</a> when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give you a spot to the next person on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2807.448s">And</a> maybe have a contract for people rather than inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots, and we don't wanna.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2835.545s">I</a> have two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2837.586s">One</a> is what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner when the superintendents <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2852.922s">get</a> that data.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2864.204s">The</a> cost of the teachers, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2867.425s">Could</a> we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2872.746s">Could</a> we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2879.507s">And</a> then like, you know, or if math, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2883.641s">coaches</a> or during the day type situation might be more affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2889.505s">But</a> I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2901.012s">It's</a> a great advantage for students that have no other way home.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2924.325s">So</a> we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2937.205s">So</a> my last question is really not to both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2940.828s">The</a> need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2949.096s">So</a> I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2955.081s">And</a> if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2959.785s">Now</a> that we're getting closer to the end of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2962.143s">I</a> think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2969.909s">And</a> we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2981.438s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=2981.999s">Are</a> you referring to the current fifth grade students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3002.253s">I'm</a> just asking for a follow-up now that they've completed their MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3007.017s">I</a> want to see the growth from their fifth grade to the sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3013.472s">might</a> not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form that we don't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3023.458s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3025.098s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3025.739s">So</a> if that could be added to the reports request list for October. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3031.122s">I</a> just want to make sure we don't drop a link.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=3036.585s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4262.145s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4263.305s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4264.186s">So,</a> so you're proposing, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4266.788s">that</a> students pay the $18 or $20 per thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4270.01s">Because</a> students already pay.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4278.476s">Okay,</a> so a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4281.117s">Number</a> one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4285.24s">Students</a> are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4289.883s">No,</a> they're more like 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4291.904s">Okay,</a> so that's over $100 <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4295.818s">for</a> just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4301.121s">Also,</a> the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4306.784s">Is</a> that-
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4313.776s">And</a> if there is a cost, is it annually?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4324.005s">Wait</a> a minute, is that something you heard, or is that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4336.712s">can</a> we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4804.087s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4805.068s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4806.25s">Mrs.</a> DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4809.274s">How</a> many children at Medford High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4818.497s">Yeah,</a> I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4824.461s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4825.181s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4826.022s">Especially</a> because we don't offer French at the middle schools.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4829.644s">So</a> I'm wondering if that has any impact on the other students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4850.52s">Yeah,</a> so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown even in an email? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4858.743s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4859.103s">Just</a> so we can plan and I want to see how strong the programs are and where the interest is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4871.428s">Oh,</a> that would be awesome, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4876.375s">You</a> send him to the superintendent, I'm sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4881.1s">He</a> can get them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4909.284s">And</a> especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4916.632s">Instead</a> of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.127s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.568s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4923.948s">Your</a> report was very thorough.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4926.169s">I</a> know your level of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4928.071s">I</a> just personally, I've known you for many, many years, and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFit. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4951.13s">I'm</a> very grateful for those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4953.653s">I</a> just wish I had gone with you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4964.504s">So</a> that's my only regret. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=4966.426s">And</a> thank you very much for your time and dedication.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5205.187s">So</a> will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5210.649s">In</a> what way, Mr. Bellson?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5219.712s">Give</a> us feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=5222.093s">She'll</a> be there for the interview process and for the decision-making process?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6099.759s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=6100.019s">Vander</a> Ploet.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7180.888s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7182.269s">And</a> it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7188.694s">Thank</a> you for all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7190.935s">I'm</a> seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7195.739s">And</a> I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7201.202s">How</a> many students throughout our district are EL students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7208.143s">So</a> what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7214.849s">District-wide,</a> so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7222.835s">Right,</a> and this almost matches it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7224.617s">Matches</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7225.277s">Yeah,</a> so it's indicative of the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7229.881s">So</a> with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7236.56s">I</a> think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7247.063s">So</a> as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7263.921s">as</a> far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7302.353s">per</a> child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7359.837s">And</a> as far as our teachers that need EL training or certification for the retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7370.199s">Are</a> we on track with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7371.42s">How</a> do we track that for teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7373.522s">We</a> are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7385.71s">And</a> I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7390.956s">with</a> that, with re-licensure?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7409.049s">So</a> I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7418.507s">we</a> could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7427.174s">She</a> may have some different ideas, having been an instructional <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7432.012s">superintendent</a> for 15 schools in EL is a big commitment there in Boston as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7498.77s">And</a> my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7507.534s">Have</a> they been informed, any feedback? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7511.505s">How</a> are they, in general, feeling about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7513.547s">They've</a> had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7558.201s">And</a> what's the overall?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7582.257s">Thank</a> you for being so inclusive with that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7585.518s">That's</a> important for that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7588.34s">A</a> great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7918.782s">That's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7921.063s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7922.284s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7922.824s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7924.825s">Mr.</a> Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7951.802s">Could</a> you define how far in the area you're talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7956.024s">So</a> that way, we're all on the same page.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7971.057s">I'd</a> just like to be on the same page with this, because interpretation can be different for different people.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=7989.782s">So</a> my next question is in section four, why did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now the bid?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8030.756s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8030.956s">And</a> my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8036.439s">I'm</a> wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8046.016s">I</a> mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8053.88s">Is</a> it the time frame that's shorter? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8055.481s">Because</a> you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8080.516s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8081.336s">And</a> my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posting?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8087.497s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8094.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8095.139s">And</a> do we advertise this? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8097.139s">Oh</a> yeah.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8103.247s">Are</a> we telling of any of our neighbor communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8107.15s">Are</a> we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8114.636s">Publicly</a> post it and see what comes back.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8841.532s">I</a> was going to ask, have you made any assumption of any groups of students coming into the classroom that may increase the numbers of changes in a way that might be this 21 assumption? <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=8856.518s">It</a> could be.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10350.18s">I</a> didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee, and I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age, and I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10370.813s">I</a> think that both schools are very good schools in that <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10376.444s">Eventually</a> people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10383.888s">And</a> I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10391.251s">And</a> my colleague, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10394.052s">Stone,</a> called that way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10397.574s">And</a> I was like, you're crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10399.535s">And</a> she actually turned out to be right on the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10403.817s">And</a> she was getting phone calls on the way <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10405.874s">to</a> that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10413.178s">So</a> I'm sitting here and that's what I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=10417.6s">So</a> I'm hoping to learn.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11781.257s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11782.432s">My</a> only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11796.915s">So</a> I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11804.417s">Maybe</a> I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at, <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11810.793s">throughout</a> the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11816.756s">But</a> there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11827.162s">So</a> that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them. <a href="https://youtu.be/OW5zlwQpW0s&t=11834.025s">That's</a> my only concern.<h2><a href="../2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA/2018-05-22_ACxsV5H4ehA.html">School Committee Meeting 05/21/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=580.713s">I</a> was just wondering how many people buzzed their heads last year and what's your goal for this year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=646.66s">So</a> will you guys get buzzed at John Brewer's, or wait and get buzzed at Gillette?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1193.657s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1193.757s">Benedetto?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1194.817s">First</a> of all, I just wanted to express how impressed I am with your presentation and how comfortable you seem coming up to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1207.041s">The</a> colored pictures, really knowing all your facts and also giving your own personal reasons why it would matter to you really brings that <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1218.05s">emotional</a> piece, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1219.63s">I</a> just want at this time to motion to approve the apple orchard and all the other fruit at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1231.073s">I</a> think it's a great hands-on learning opportunity for not only our high school students, but also all students educated there, especially our early childhood students. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=1241.134s">So</a> at this time, I make that motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2170.264s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2172.786s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2174.162s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2174.922s">Diane,</a> we were talking recently about after school and before school programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2181.425s">Were</a> there a lot of new enrollees with this kindergarten open houses for those programs?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2187.847s">Are</a> we going to be able to accommodate all of our students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2231.344s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2232.244s">We</a> did get an email from a prospective new parent for next year, and they were concerned especially about the capability of after school care. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2243.21s">So</a> we are going to assure that all new students that enroll are probably going to have a spot?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2284.925s">And</a> when would we know and be able to tell parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2289.047s">Because</a> I'm sure if they don't qualify for an after school program, they need as much notice as possible to have a safe place for their children.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2733.49s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2734.61s">I'm</a> really glad that we were able to offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2737.511s">This</a> came about because of MCAF scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2740.412s">And</a> was there any? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2743.943s">growth,</a> any way to show growth from the beginning of the program for the students to the end of the program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2793.629s">Also,</a> when I saw the amount of absences, maybe some regulations within the program, like if you're absent more than, if it's a six-week program, if you're absent more than three times, we're gonna give your spot to the next person on the wait list. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2807.414s">And</a> like maybe have a contract for people rather than, you know, inconsistency, because the real, we wanna put people that have the opportunity to grow in those spots.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2835.528s">I</a> have two more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2837.569s">One</a> is, what was the cost involved, so that way we could plan for next year, because I do think that this may be necessary, depending on MCAT scores, and we'll know that in October, or maybe a little sooner, when the superintendents <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2852.905s">get</a> that data.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2864.187s">The</a> cost of the teachers, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2867.408s">Could</a> we get a report of a breakdown of that through the mayor to the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2872.729s">Could</a> we get a report of the cost involved so that way we can make it a priority during our budget season? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2879.47s">And</a> then like, you know, or if math, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2883.624s">coaches</a> or during the day type situation might be more affordable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2889.468s">But</a> I like the idea of having a later time at different schools for kids to go home and they can take advantage of other programming, not just this programming at the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2900.995s">It's</a> a great advantage for students that have no other way home.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2924.291s">So</a> we should know how much the bus was utilized, and if it's necessary, or a smaller bus, or any ways that we could save money and still provide the programming and not be wasteful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2937.168s">So</a> my last question is really not to both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2940.81s">The</a> need of this came out because of last year's, especially former fifth graders, scores on MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2949.075s">So</a> I'd like to know how we're continuing to follow those students in the sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2955.059s">And</a> if anybody is checking in, I know we've asked before and reports were given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2959.762s">Now</a> that we're getting closer to the end of the year, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2962.126s">I</a> think that we should have an update on those students and make sure that they received everything they needed for this current MCAS that they just took. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2969.872s">And</a> we want a report on how those specific students did as soon as we get the release of their MCAS scores to make sure those students don't fall through any cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2981.421s">You</a> know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=2981.982s">Are</a> you referring to the current fifth grade students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3002.538s">I'm</a> just asking for a follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3004.94s">Now</a> that they've completed their MCAS, I wanna see the growth from their fifth grade to their sixth grade MCAS scores and make sure that every student that might not have done well last year is moving and showing growth, and if not, they get the services they need in any way, shape, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3022.124s">That</a> we don't- Next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3023.444s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3025.064s">Right,</a> so if that could be added to the reports request list for October. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3031.085s">I</a> just wanna make sure we <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3034.55s">don't</a> drop a link. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3035.771s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=3038.272s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4262.126s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4263.286s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4264.166s">So,</a> so you're proposing, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4266.772s">that</a> students pay the $18 or $20 per thing?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4278.439s">Okay,</a> so a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4281.101s">Number</a> one, students can pay for it, and it's either $18 or $20 per test. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4285.223s">Students</a> are already paying for their AP exams, which are what, at least 63 last time I- No, they're more like 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4291.887s">Okay,</a> so that's over $100 <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4295.802s">for</a> just their language, not counting any other AP that they might be taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4301.105s">Also,</a> the $2,000 that's allocated in your budget report, is that the cost of the seal? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4306.767s">Is</a> that the-
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4313.761s">And</a> if there is a cost, is it annually?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4323.328s">We</a> don't have those answers yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4325.369s">Is</a> that something you heard, or is that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4336.695s">can</a> we wait till we get more information from DESC about the cost involved and what's involved?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4804.067s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4805.048s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4806.209s">Mrs.</a> DeCarlo, do you know what the breakdown of students are? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4809.251s">How</a> many children at Medford High School are in Spanish, French, and Italian?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4818.42s">Yeah,</a> I'm just curious, like, what students, and do students get to pick what they want as freshmen? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4824.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4825.185s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4826.006s">Especially</a> because we don't offer French at the middle schools.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4829.609s">So</a> I'm wondering if that has any impact on the environment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4850.486s">Yeah,</a> so is there any way that, I know that you're retiring soon, is there any way that you could provide us with that breakdown, even in an email? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4858.73s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4859.07s">Just</a> so we can plan, and I wanna see how strong the programs are, and where the interest is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4871.397s">Oh,</a> that would be awesome, thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4876.358s">you</a> send him to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4877.938s">I'm</a> sure he's happy to email us that if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4881.059s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4882.82s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4909.261s">And</a> especially now, because a few years ago we changed the program so that students take languages all six days.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4916.603s">Instead</a> of, they used to have five day block, like five out of the six day block. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.11s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.551s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4923.951s">Your</a> report was very thorough. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4925.332s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4926.153s">I</a> know your level of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4928.054s">I</a> just personally, I've known you for many, many years and I can't thank you enough for not only the academic service that you've given these students, but the global opportunities in taking them across the other side of the world and touring Italy and Spain and really giving them an opportunity and seeing the world outside of MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4951.093s">I'm</a> very grateful for those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4953.615s">I</a> just wish I had gone with you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4964.025s">So</a> that's my only regret. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=4966.407s">And</a> thank you very much for your time and dedication.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5205.179s">So</a> will the incoming superintendent be part of this process?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5210.624s">In</a> what way, Mr. Bellson?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=5221.692s">she'll</a> be there for the interview process and for the decision making.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6099.745s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=6099.985s">Vander</a> Ploet.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7180.854s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7182.235s">And</a> it was very good to see how your first year went and all the initiatives that you put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7188.681s">Thank</a> you for all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7190.923s">I'm</a> seeing an increase in EL programs throughout the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7195.727s">And</a> I know you commented that we have 40 new students from the beginning of this year till now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7201.192s">How</a> many students throughout our district are EL students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7208.127s">So</a> what is that, 10, 11% district-wide, not just at the McGlynn, but?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7214.832s">District-wide,</a> so 11% of our students, and rising yearly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7222.999s">Right,</a> and this almost matches it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7224.6s">Matches</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7225.261s">Yeah,</a> so it's indicative of the whole district. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7229.844s">So</a> with it, with the growth that we've seen in the last, what, three to five years, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7236.527s">I</a> think that we need to pre-plan for more EL programs and to have a short-term plan for EL and a long-term plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7247.036s">So</a> as the new superintendent comes forward, I'd love to see that and maybe the curriculum subcommittee to talk about this so we can start putting those, I said years ago that EL is gonna be bigger than special education as far as, or equal to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7263.887s">as</a> far as programming and some of the programming that you're talking about, the required PAC or DAC, whichever one you choose, and all of those things seem to be following in line of how the special education programs are run throughout the district and their requirements, at least I see that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7302.316s">per</a> child per teacher ratios as far as state requirements?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7359.808s">And</a> as far as our teachers that need <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7364.56s">EL</a> training or certification for the retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7370.185s">Are</a> we on track with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7371.406s">How</a> do we track that for teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7373.508s">We</a> are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7385.679s">And</a> I'm sure the 15 required hours in EL has helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7390.942s">with</a> that, with re-licensure?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7409.033s">So</a> I'm not going to make an official motion for you to meet with the curriculum subcommittee, but in September or October, maybe, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7418.49s">we</a> could regroup and possibly ask the chairperson to call a meeting and just have short-term and long-term goals with the new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7427.138s">She</a> may have some different ideas, having been an instructional superintendent for 15 schools and EL is a big <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7435.837s">commitment</a> there in Boston as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7498.735s">And</a> my final question is, have you gotten any feedback from the McGlynn teachers about the change that's gonna take place next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7507.6s">Have</a> they been informed, any feedback? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7511.471s">How</a> are they, in general, feeling about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7513.532s">They've</a> had a lot of change through the year, and I just want to make sure that they're incorporated in the communication as well as decision-making.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7558.191s">And</a> what's the overall
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7582.24s">Thank</a> you for being so inclusive with that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7585.481s">That's</a> important for that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7588.323s">A</a> great report, thank you, and I motion to accept the report and place it on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7918.899s">That's</a> important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7921.26s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7922.261s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7922.801s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7924.802s">Mr.</a> Bilson, why in number one, did you emphasize area university?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7951.778s">So</a> I mean, I imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7952.278s">Could</a> you define how far in the area you're talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7956.02s">Because</a> that way, we're all on the same page.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7971.035s">I'd</a> just like to be on the same page with this because interpretation can be
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7988.925s">I</a> mean- So my next question is in section four. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=7993.008s">Why</a> did it change from us being responsible for the renovations and oversight of the renovations to now
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8027.139s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8030.738s">Okay,</a> my last question is for our attorney that's in the audience tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8036.403s">I'm</a> wondering if this is different in any way than any other RFP that we usually do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8045.999s">I</a> mean, you mentioned that you went into town and talked to the people there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8053.865s">Is</a> it the time frame that's shorter? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8055.466s">Because</a> you made it seem like it was a little bit different than the usual.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8080.486s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8081.326s">And</a> my last question is, is two weeks a typical time frame for an RFP to be posted?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8087.471s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8092.635s">So</a> a week?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8094.617s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8095.137s">And</a> do we advertise this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8097.019s">How</a> do we have to? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8098.079s">Oh,</a> yeah.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8103.21s">Are</a> we telling of any of our neighbor communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8107.131s">Are</a> we reaching out and saying, hey, we're looking for a partnership and this is what we're looking for?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8668.185s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=8840.482s">I</a> was going to ask, have you been able to view of any groups
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10350.167s">I</a> didn't push my button, but I think it's a tough call for this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10357.672s">And</a> I'm just listening to some of the members on the committee with children close to this age. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10364.437s">And</a> I'm just taking in the information at this point and just seeing what's best for the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10370.774s">I</a> think that both schools are very good schools in that eventually people will be happy, but I think it's difficult for any parent or any child to swallow a change this late in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10383.859s">And</a> I hope that we move to make a total lottery at some point for these schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10391.241s">And</a> my colleague, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10394.022s">Stone,</a> called that way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10397.538s">And</a> I was like, you're crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10399.519s">And</a> she actually turned out to be right on the money, and she was getting phone calls on the way to that last meeting saying, don't you vote for a lottery by people that have supported her through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10413.168s">So</a> I'm sitting here, and that's what I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=10417.571s">So</a> I'm hoping to learn.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11781.227s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11782.415s">My</a> only concern with this is a lot of our population could be single parents that might want something brought forward, and they can't leave their children unattended to attend these meetings, but they could be watching it at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11796.899s">So</a> I agree that less use is best, less is best in this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11804.4s">Maybe</a> I do agree that announcing who it was, if it's commented on or looked at, <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11810.779s">throughout</a> the meeting and not later, then I do agree that that should be announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11816.742s">But</a> there are people that don't have the ability to leave their home at seven o'clock at nighttime because they're not able, and they're not gonna bring their children out at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11827.146s">So</a> that would be a concern to me, that people wanted to speak about an item and we're not reaching them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ACxsV5H4ehA&t=11834.009s">That's</a> my only concern.<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14/2018-05-09_bCMsj8WYK14.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 7, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2356.608s">These</a> are fairly new programs within the Method Public Schools and the vocational schools, and we have machinery in there that labs at the Broad Institute have, and that Tufts University even comes down and uses and teaches us children with. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2376.818s">We</a> give our students excellent opportunities, and I'm so happy to see this move forward and to see the collaboration <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2386.455s">amongst</a> different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2389.916s">I</a> could not be prouder of our teachers and our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=2394.057s">Thank</a> you for representing Medford so well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4769.112s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4770.453s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4771.674s">Um,</a> I recently found out that, um, I had read the report and the first time I read it, I, I, it didn't jump out at me that the teachers would take it this way because Roy has given, um, Mr. Bellson has given us different scenarios of what could have happened to have that, um, gun clip be left in, in there, whether, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4799.172s">It</a> was this scenario or many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4800.913s">He's</a> given a few ideas for people to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4805.196s">So</a> it didn't jump out at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4806.897s">But</a> when it came to my attention and I reread this section, I could see how you would feel and take this in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4814.943s">And</a> for that, as a school committee, I'm sorry that you felt that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4819.386s">Because</a> I value the work that you do with the students in our community more than I could ever say in words. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4826.657s">I</a> value the extra time, the extra mittens when they're cold, the hugs when their parents leave them at the door and they miss their mommy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4836.785s">And</a> I don't care if they're kindergarten or eighth grade, there are days when you miss your mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4842.409s">So</a> you take care of the students both academically and emotionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4848.353s">And</a> if your emotions were hurt by this, I feel bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4851.656s">And</a> as a community member, I want you to know <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4855.508s">I,</a> as a member of this committee, value your work every single day, every single night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4861.931s">And</a> recently, I was just at your school on Saturday night, and I saw your new assistant principal there, working hard and late and missing an evening out with her family and her friends to make sure your school was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4876.756s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4877.036s">Lu,</a> I don't know if you're here, but I want you to know I appreciate you holding down the foot in this very difficult year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4884.875s">You've</a> done amazing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4895.561s">And</a> I was at the play the other night, and the kids had the biggest smile, and they performed, and it was so uplifting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4903.205s">And</a> it was after a day I moved my oldest child out of my house, so I was so happy to see kids and see them singing and dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4912.491s">even</a> though I was missing my own children being that age again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4916.014s">So</a> it was joyful and happy, and I was glad to see that happening at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=4921.357s">So</a> again, I want to thank you all and renew my commitment to you as a committee member, that I am here any time that you feel that you have something to say.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6140.989s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6142.79s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6143.691s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6144.191s">I</a> actually requested the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6146.413s">I</a> requested the meeting because May 1st was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6149.928s">and</a> my understanding that Mr. Belson was retiring as of April 30th, and that we needed to have an official person named as acting superintendent to get us through the transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6163.23s">So</a> I had no idea that there were other options at play that were gonna be presented that evening, so I too was shocked that this came up at this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6179.468s">I</a> assumed the vote of the committee, and when the committee voted to extend him to April 30th, I took on that, as that's my new role, is to support him till that point, and then make sure our district has somebody at the helm. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6194.134s">So</a> I really pushed to have this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6198.355s">So</a> it was a little quicker than some, and it was a special meeting to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6204.518s">My</a> understanding, that is, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6206.262s">someone</a> within the district would step into that role, whether a deputy, a principal, someone we felt confident, you know, to help us through, because Mr. Belson was also going to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6219.389s">And</a> knowing him, as we all do, we know he works way beyond the hours required, and he was being contracted to continue for 25 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6228.474s">So</a> he was accessible to help with any bigger issues, and I'm sure <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6233.477s">with</a> his dedication to this community over all these years that he would wholeheartedly do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6239.96s">So</a> I honestly was shocked by the outcome of that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6248.124s">It</a> didn't even enter my mind as a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6251.306s">Had</a> I thought that that was a possibility, I would have, like I do usually, hey, important things are being discussed and put it on social media, please come. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6262.153s">right,</a> please come, or I would have requested that the meeting be televised, because I have done that also in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6269.094s">And</a> I know we're getting new cameras in different areas, so we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6274.956s">Because</a> transparency is extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6279.076s">And</a> people not finding out important information online is, they feel insulted to find it out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6292.243s">I</a> don't know what to say about the outcome of the meeting, but I can own that I did bring it forward and did not tell a push for it to be because I thought it was just an interest, you know, an interim person stepping in for two months.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6622.459s">Thank</a> you so much, Mayburg. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6624.14s">I</a> still have some questions, so I need some transparency and clarity on what exactly the superintendent's role is for the rest of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6632.484s">Will</a> he be, will he have whole power as the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6637.687s">Will</a> he be hiring and moving people from, and promoting people and providing raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6644.234s">And</a> I also heard a few rumors that he's telling people that he's going to be here beyond June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6650.476s">Is</a> that a possibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6651.956s">Is</a> there something about that happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6656.138s">I</a> just want to put it all out here while we're on camera and everybody's in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6660.839s">I</a> just have these general questions and if someone could answer them for me and any other questions that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6666.181s">I</a> just want to know are the rules we put in place in February for him to continue to April 30th still in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6673.42s">or</a> have they been removed? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6676.202s">I'm</a> really not sure what we voted for that night.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6682.287s">So</a> he cannot hire people or move people or give raises or promotions unless it's like something to just provide services till June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6693.636s">Anything</a> beyond that, our new superintendent would be making those choices, like department heads and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6701.302s">Yes,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6702.583s">And</a> the rumors that I'm hearing that he's telling people that he might be staying past June 30th, has anybody talked to him about doing any consulting beyond that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6714.652s">No,</a> this body has not talked about that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6767.287s">Well,</a> I would like to see the new superintendent make those choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6771.609s">If</a> that superintendent told us that they had flexibility in coming forward, I'm sure Mr. Belson can give <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6780.682s">the</a> information, but the final decision, even restructuring of the central administration, you know, putting those positions back in place, I think that should be the new superintendent's place. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6792.248s">I</a> don't think that a new superintendent should step in and, you know, have to work with what's been hired from an outgoing superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6801.212s">His</a> input can be done by June 30th, and then the new superintendent should have the final decision.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6856.398s">So,</a> Mayor Burke, can I answer that question about the director of foreign language? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6860.939s">For</a> instance, so say the new superintendent wants our foreign languages to develop in a different road than we currently have in MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6873.163s">Maybe</a> a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6875.083s">So</a> say the new director of foreign language teaches <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6882.067s">a</a> program that we might not be moving forward for for the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6886.748s">I</a> would hate for that to happen when the new superintendent, like she talked about Mandarin in one of her interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6893.529s">I</a> remember her speaking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6896.21s">So</a> she might have a new direction and new programs in her mind of how to move Medford forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6902.831s">And</a> if we hire someone in a role that has what we currently have and what not our future is going to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6911.622s">we</a> could be tying our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6913.423s">So</a> that's why the importance of not hiring directors are important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6918.767s">So</a> I really would like to either let her make those decisions on, you know, bring the finalists to her, maybe do the preliminary work, but really have some more input from the new superintendent and what her vision for our school district is going to be rather than the outgoing superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=6938.428s">and</a> someone have to work within those restraints.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7214.418s">Um,</a> a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7215.739s">Number</a> one, can we get a list of those positions that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7219.822s">are</a> necessary to move forward so that—I know we asked for a list of retirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7226.186s">It</a> wasn't added to the back of the agenda for reports, so we had asked for a list of retirements or open positions for next year, so that will be helpful for us to know what interviews are happening, what's going on, because, like, I did not have any idea that those interviews were happening for the foreign language department at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7248.534s">That</a> would be helpful as committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7250.876s">Also,</a> I'd like to, through you, to address the superintendent about the rumors that he plans on staying after June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7258.341s">Is</a> that your intention, Mr. Belson?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=7262.784s">Reporting</a> on rumors.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8336.005s">Final</a> comment, Mr. Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8337.787s">To</a> be clear in transform, trans, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8341.491s">Transparent,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8342.412s">It's</a> been a long night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8344.653s">I</a> just want you to know, this didn't come out at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8348.095s">We</a> didn't pull out this paperwork and read the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8350.797s">We</a> didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8351.797s">Because</a> if we had, we would have went down to the assistant superintendent when the deputy said that she wasn't able to take that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8359.942s">I</a> didn't bring it forward because I was floored by what was being proposed to me at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8364.925s">It</a> didn't enter my mind until someone asked me for a copy of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8368.527s">And</a> I went, oh my gosh. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8370.223s">I</a> can't believe I didn't bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8371.983s">And</a> our new members probably have never seen this or read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8375.704s">So</a> yeah, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8378.145s">This</a> should have been implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8379.785s">I'm</a> surprised it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8382.026s">I</a> would have loved to seen this implemented because I know Mr. Belson wouldn't have left us hanging and he would still be there for vital information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8389.648s">And</a> I made that point at that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8391.368s">So</a> I'm being transparent about what I did and what I didn't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8394.869s">I</a> didn't bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8396.01s">I</a> didn't think about this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8397.965s">This</a> should have been implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8399.386s">This</a> is our policy that we voted on when you brought it forward, when I left you hanging that night, and I apologize for, because I should have said something that evening as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8410.573s">So</a> I own what I've done, and I'm going to try to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8414.875s">So,</a> you know, that's all I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8418.617s">And</a> we need to make sure that, you know, we have people like you reminding us, hey, we did this, because we can't remember everything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=8510.659s">I</a> was just waiting for the wording.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9805.848s">I'm</a> just trying to help clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9809.19s">I</a> believe it was a company that was coming in and offering a specific program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=9816.258s">That</a> is there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10454.918s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10457.259s">There's</a> a lot of good ideas and a lot of things we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10459.841s">What</a> we need is what we discussed with our candidates, is a short-term plan for next year, and we need to look at the bigger environment, because other than bodies, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10472.42s">There</a> are a lot of different things that we need to do, but I don't think doing that in May for September is feasible right now, even though I agree with your long-term idea, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10482.587s">Because</a> I think that will handle a lot of the other demographics that need to be addressed, but I don't think we'll have enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10491.674s">I</a> like your idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10492.795s">I</a> don't want to target one school to stay there, because I think opening it up, as you suggested, is gonna be, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10501.603s">more</a> productive for our community and not targeting people directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10507.227s">And</a> I liked what you said about clinging to people on your microphone and saying, please step up now, because we do need this help. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10516.794s">We</a> don't want to make these decisions for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10519.335s">We</a> want parents to be a partner with us deciding how to handle this situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=10525.9s">And</a> that's all I really have to say.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11386.706s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11387.726s">First</a> of all, the mayor has said that she's been working on this for months and this is the first that this body is hearing of this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11395.502s">There</a> is such a lack of information given to us this night. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11401.851s">When</a> will they be using our facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11403.734s">How</a> much money will they be providing? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11405.497s">How</a> many courses will our teachers get to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11408.057s">This</a> one-page thing does not tell me anything about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11412.64s">And</a> if we need to act quickly, then maybe we should have heard about it before the middle of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11418.844s">I'm</a> sorry, but I'm really not happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11421.025s">And</a> we're trying to talk about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11423.867s">Is</a> this for their games? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11425.328s">Is</a> there going to be spectators in our school gyms? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11428.37s">When</a> will they be played? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11430.091s">How</a> is security going to be handled? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11432.232s">This</a> is a big commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11433.953s">This</a> isn't a one-pager at the end of a night <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11437.515s">So</a> I would like to table this discussion until we have more information from the district so that we can review a lot more questions and not have this brought before us in this manner at this late time of the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11450.686s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11454.009s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11457.011s">I</a> said no.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=11475.86s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12968.972s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12969.452s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12981.194s">And</a> you were very tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12984.185s">Very</a> fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12985.245s">They</a> learned a tremendous amount that they carried forward with them, not only to college, but in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12992.128s">I</a> appreciate that as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=12994.989s">And</a> as an administrator, you have always been very receptive to the committee and any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13001.411s">And</a> thank you for all your years of service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13005.092s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13006.072s">It's</a> been a privilege.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13235.129s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13235.99s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13237.631s">Motion</a> to accept this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13239.452s">I</a> always want to take in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13242.714s">And</a> thank, could we send a letter of thanks to the foundation? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13246.217s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13247.078s">As</a> well as invite the junior class members to our next meeting that will be receiving these awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13254.823s">Just</a> so we can honor them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13273.297s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13662.824s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13663.764s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13664.885s">That's</a> run out of the special education department is my understanding under Kathy Medaglio and that student services. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13674.287s">I</a> know because at my school, I'm the trainer in safety care and in CPI. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13682.409s">So</a> what happens is that you need a team of teachers that are able to respond to an emergency situation so you can be called away. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13691.708s">and</a> a gym teacher or a physical education teacher or other specialists are usually on that team because they have the most flexibility in their schedule and can respond very quickly to different situations, whereas a classroom teacher might have at any given time 20 students in their care and not be able to respond easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13716.192s">Physical</a> education teachers, on the other hand, I call them classroom teachers because they do teach classes of children, but they just have a little bit more flexibility about being around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=13730.237s">And</a> they're alone sometimes in different areas of the building, so it's good to have them trained.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14308.527s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14310.787s">Do</a> you happen to have a breakdown of the additional security costs since we added the dual monitors?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14339.323s">I</a> was just wondering what the total cost was that, and I don't know how difficult that'd be for you to get to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14345.047s">Just</a> an idea so that we can use that figure to pre-plan for next year, if that's the route that we're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14351.25s">It</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14353.532s">Also,</a> could you provide us a copy of the last audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14356.514s">I</a> know it was requested at one of our... It is just being finalized right now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14367.848s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14368.689s">So</a> could we have that on the requested reports list, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14372.651s">A</a> copy of the audit, the last financial audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14377.594s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14378.354s">And</a> while we were talking about security, you brought up a question that is really not for you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14385.459s">Patterson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14385.999s">Thank</a> you, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14387.32s">It's</a> for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14389.241s">Could</a> you please, with all respect, give us an update on the report from the Martha Coakley law firm?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14412.3s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14412.641s">And</a> a follow-up, it's not so much a financial follow-up, but a few more reports that were requested that weren't on the requester reports list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14421.306s">So</a> while I was talking about it, I thought I'd bring it up to Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14426.457s">A</a> report on the traffic pattern at the pool door so that way we can make determinations if we're moving that person at nine o'clock in the morning down to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14437.539s">Could</a> you add that to the list so that can be provided to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14441.0s">It's</a> just a tally, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14443.44s">The</a> community school usage I just received now, so I'll look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14449.202s">I</a> mean, we got this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14450.762s">This</a> has all the rentals for the community schools for the year, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14454.063s">Is</a> that what this report is?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14471.977s">No,</a> I appreciate you having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14473.338s">I'm</a> gonna look at it, and if I have any questions, I'll bring them up at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14477.64s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for providing that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14482.083s">And</a> I know the financial report on that is coming up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14487.386s">Mr.</a> Belson's report on the cost analyst feasibility study for the items suggested on the building and grounds meeting, that report is not listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14500.257s">Remember,</a> Roy, you were talking about giving us a feasibility study and prices for the buildings and grounds items that were suggested.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14520.755s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14525.177s">Yeah,</a> and I just want to announce them so everybody knows as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14528.178s">In</a> requested number of bullying reports completed by school, that was requested by someone I noticed in the minutes that wasn't added to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14539.202s">Bullying</a> reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14541.864s">The</a> number by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14543.612s">And</a> again, the list of retirements coming forward, so that way we have that data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14553.115s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14553.715s">I</a> really appreciate the report you provided to us on the finance budget and the time that your department took to present this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14562.738s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14564.978s">Motion</a> to approve report and place on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=14584.044s">That's</a> insurance coverage for the school district.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15178.626s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15181.268s">So</a> I went by each item. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15185.738s">I</a> found it easy to do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15188.44s">So</a> with Edgerly Field, I took the total deposits of $142,374.50, and then the expenses that were listed were $162,916, which means a difference of $20,000, a little bit more, in the red. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15213.582s">but</a> we had money in the account prior to that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15216.344s">So</a> we're not really in the red in that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15218.846s">Does</a> that include the bond and the insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15223.629s">Because</a> I know- The bond and the interest, yes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15226.751s">I</a> knew a few years ago we got into a little trouble with that and the city helped us out and I'm glad to see that added in.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15232.835s">I</a> just want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15236.217s">I</a> just want to make sure that the revenue coming in, that we're really, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15240.956s">having</a> everybody pay for all the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15244.298s">I'd</a> also like to see the personnel in the payroll issues listed when we get these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15252.423s">I</a> know that's a lot and I don't know if that's easy to do or not easy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15257.966s">And</a> I got the usage, that was my other note. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15260.948s">You</a> provided us with the usage of who's on Edgeley Field as well as any buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15267.452s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15268.052s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15270.837s">And</a> you know what I really was hoping to see in part of this is donations of use time on our fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15279.161s">Like</a> a list of people in the community, we donate time on the fields, on our buildings, because that's a PR thing, like we care about the community, we donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15292.808s">I</a> know Mr. Maloney definitely provides many people in our community time, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15300.09s">to</a> use our facilities and donated, and that was part of the computer program that I had hoped we would get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15306.055s">And</a> maybe that's in that, I just haven't had a chance tonight, there's been so many goings on, to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15312.099s">So</a> maybe someone could clarify that for me, if that's in this, or how that's being tracked, because that was requested a couple times throughout the years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15342.326s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15345.169s">Just</a> in general in the future, I mean, people tell me all the time about different things going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15352.055s">I</a> don't see some of those things listed, so that's why I thought they were more of donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15357.877s">So</a> we can move on to the athletic revenue expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15361.939s">So</a> I just wanted to be forthright and clear, the income for the athletics department was $81,974.25, and the expenses were $93,044.78, so the difference there is $11,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15381.003s">But</a> that's not the end of the year, like you said, the gate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15386.684s">And</a> as far as employees for the athletics department, they're usually under the school employee people and not generally listed under athletics in this capacity.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15404.623s">just</a> getting through it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15407.264s">And</a> then community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15409.024s">So</a> this is the biggest amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15414.705s">So</a> my first question is AIC, Japanese schools, the church, those ones that you listed, we don't know what those amounts are and we also don't know when those payments are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15429.471s">Could</a> you provide us some of the information?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15442.02s">Do</a> you mind just telling us an update as those go out, so just like when they went out, how much they're being charged, and how that affects their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15453.489s">Also,</a> the community schools income is 201,146.41, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15459.174s">The</a> expenses here are only $18,310.08, if I did my numbers right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15465.418s">So</a> the total income is $191,836, is that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15481.587s">That</a> does not include the payroll? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15483.308s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15484.389s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15485.292s">Could</a> we get that number when we get the updated list of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15488.474s">That</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15489.515s">And</a> maybe just add it to this so we see it all at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15493.136s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15494.837s">Moving</a> forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15500.34s">I</a> also thought that there was a theater group that was using the high school theater at the same time that the high school musical was trying to be put on, because I think they rented it, or I don't know if it was donated, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15512.924s">I</a> think some of our other members' children were in that program, so I don't know the name of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15517.687s">There</a> was a theater group that was being, they were practicing up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15522.689s">Mr.</a> Belson, do you know about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15529.193s">But</a> their practices were at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15532.835s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15534.816s">Oh,</a> there was some production up at the high school using the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15541.599s">Was</a> it an Arlington group? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15546.245s">Oh,</a> it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15549.228s">So</a> there was an Arlington group that using the Karen Theater, and I'm assuming that they rented it out, and there were conflict in timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15564.76s">We</a> got an email about this, Mr. Maloney, about the high school kids when they were, a parent sent it to us.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15615.614s">Okay,</a> thank you for reaching out to that parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15617.935s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15619.376s">What</a> Arlington group is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15620.517s">Because</a> I don't see it listed as on the commuter school rental.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15644.813s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15646.554s">I'd</a> appreciate that very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15648.075s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15648.635s">And</a> so with what was presented, there is the $191,836 in this area, and other than the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15662.242s">personnel.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15663.483s">We'll</a> come back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15664.784s">We'll</a> come back to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15666.906s">We'll</a> just table it until we get that additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15671.71s">I'm</a> almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15672.511s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15674.612s">Uh,</a> the La Conte rank, the income is 157,600 and 600 having trouble reading my writing this late and the expenses are $227,049 and 63 cents with a, <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15692.629s">a</a> difference of $69,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15695.47s">I</a> know that this is a benefit to have a rink in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15703.094s">I</a> don't know if we can advertise more rink time or how we can help change that deficit, and maybe it will change by the end of this 17? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15715.459s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15720.382s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15721.772s">And</a> the last one is the pool, which is income of $149,025.50 and expenses of $173,657 with a difference of $24,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15727.093s">And</a> I don't think that's terrible considering all the extra security over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15730.114s">Was</a> that allocated to the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15731.274s">Yes,</a> yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15748.522s">So</a> I think that's pretty good because we knew when we opened those pools that it was going to be a tight thing because of the cost of running a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15756.284s">So,</a> and I think it's a value to our students and to the community, well worth the investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15763.545s">I</a> just want to thank you for providing me with these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15766.806s">And</a> if you could follow up with those few questions, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15770.827s">And</a> thank you for staying so late to answer some of these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15774.348s">I</a> really do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15776.512s">have</a> a good understanding of this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15779.254s">So</a> any extra money, how is that allocated? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15782.436s">Where</a> does it go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15783.217s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bCMsj8WYK14&t=15787.2s">So</a> do we have a balance in that account?<h2><a href="../2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU/2018-05-09_C2svyKx7vRU.html">School Committee 05/07/18</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2346.506s">That</a> was part of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2348.628s">Did</a> you guys make that? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2349.629s">We</a> had it in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2353.172s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2353.653s">I</a> also want to comment on... <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2356.574s">These</a> are fairly new programs within the method public schools and the vocational schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2361.997s">And</a> we have machinery in there that labs at the Broad Institute have, and that Tufts University even comes down and uses and teaches us children with. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2376.785s">We</a> give our students excellent opportunities, and I'm so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2382.979s">to</a> see this move forward and to see the collaboration amongst different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2389.882s">I</a> could not be prouder of our teachers and our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=2394.024s">Thank</a> you for representing Method so well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4769.078s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4770.419s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4772.04s">I</a> recently found out that I had read the report and the first time I read it, it didn't jump out at me that the teachers would take it this way because Roy has given, Mr. Bellson has given us different scenarios of what could have happened to have that gun clip be left in there, whether, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4799.118s">It</a> was this scenario or many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4800.879s">He's</a> given a few ideas for people to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4805.162s">So</a> it didn't jump out at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4806.863s">But</a> when it came to my attention and I reread this section, I could see how you would feel and take this in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4814.909s">And</a> for that, as a school committee, I'm sorry that you felt that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4819.352s">Because</a> I value the work that you do with the students in our community more than I could ever say in words. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4826.623s">I</a> value the extra time, the extra mittens when they're cold, the hugs when their parents leave them at the door and they miss their mommy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4836.745s">And</a> I don't care if they're kindergarten or eighth grade, there are days when you miss your mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4842.366s">So</a> you take care of the students both academically and emotionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4848.307s">And</a> if your emotions were hurt by this, I feel bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4851.607s">And</a> as a community member, I want you to know <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4855.454s">I,</a> as a member of this committee, value your work every single day, every single night. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4861.895s">And</a> recently, I was just at your school on Saturday night, and I saw your new assistant principal there, working hard and late and missing an evening out with her family and her friends to make sure your school was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4876.718s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4877.019s">Lu,</a> I don't know if you're here, but I want you to know I appreciate you holding down the foot in this very difficult year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4884.844s">You've</a> done amazing work. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4895.529s">And</a> I was at the play the other night, and the kids had the biggest smile, and they performed, and it was so uplifting. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4903.173s">And</a> it was after a day I moved my oldest child out of my house, so I was so happy to see kids and see them singing and dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4912.44s">even</a> though I was missing my own children being that age again. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4915.962s">So</a> it was joyful and happy, and I was glad to see that happening at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=4921.325s">So</a> again, I want to thank you all and renew my commitment to you as a committee member, that I am here any time that you feel that you have something to say.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6140.955s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6143.658s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6144.158s">I</a> actually requested the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6146.38s">I</a> requested the meeting because May 1st was coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6149.894s">and</a> my understanding that Mr. Belson was retiring as of April 30th, and that we needed to have an official person named as acting superintendent to get us through the transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6163.198s">So</a> I had no idea that there were other options at play that were gonna be presented that evening, so I too was shocked that this came up at this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6179.435s">I</a> assumed the vote of the committee, and when the committee voted to extend him to April 30th, I took on that as that's my new role, is to support him till that point, and then make sure our district has somebody at the helm. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6194.102s">So</a> I really pushed to have this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6198.324s">So</a> it was a little quicker than some, and it was a special meeting to discuss it, my understanding that is <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6206.212s">someone</a> within the district would step into that role, whether a deputy, a principal, someone we felt confident, you know, to help us through because Mr. Belson was also going to be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6219.337s">And</a> knowing him, as we all do, we know he works way beyond the hours required, and he was being contracted to continue for 25 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6228.44s">So</a> he was accessible to help with any bigger issues, and I'm sure <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6233.443s">with</a> his dedication to this community over all these years, that he would wholeheartedly do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6239.926s">So</a> I honestly was shocked by the outcome of that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6248.09s">It</a> didn't even enter my mind as a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6251.272s">Had</a> I thought that that was a possibility, I would have, like I do usually, hey, important things are being discussed and put it on social media, please come. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6262.12s">right,</a> please come, or I would have requested that the meeting be televised, because I have done that also in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6269.061s">And</a> I know we're getting new cameras in different areas, so we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6274.902s">Because</a> transparency is extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6279.043s">And</a> people not finding out important information online is, they feel insulted to find it out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6292.209s">I</a> don't know what to say about the outcome of the meeting, but I can own that I did bring it forward and did not tell a push for it to be, because I thought it was just an interest, you know, an interim person stepping in for two months.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6622.427s">Thank</a> you so much, Mayburg. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6624.107s">I</a> still have some questions, so I need some transparency and clarity on what exactly the superintendent's role is for the rest of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6632.45s">Will</a> he have whole power as the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6637.651s">Will</a> he be hiring and moving people and promoting people and providing raises? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6644.2s">And</a> I also heard a few rumors that he's telling people that he's going to be here beyond June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6650.443s">Is</a> that a possibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6651.923s">Is</a> there something about that happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6654.644s">I</a> just want to put it all out here while we're on camera and everybody's in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6660.607s">I</a> just have these general questions and if someone could answer them for me and any other questions that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6666.149s">I</a> just want to know are the rules we put in place in February for him to continue to April 30th still in place? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6673.387s">or</a> have they been removed? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6676.149s">I'm</a> really not sure what we voted for that night.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6682.254s">So</a> he cannot hire people or move people or give raises or promotions unless it's like something to just provide services till June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6693.603s">Anything</a> beyond that, our new superintendent would be making those choices like department heads and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6701.268s">Yes,</a> of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6702.55s">And</a> the rumors that I'm hearing that he's telling people that he might be staying past June 30th, has anybody talked to him about doing any consulting beyond that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6715.842s">No,</a> this body has not talked about that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6767.246s">Well,</a> I would like to see the new superintendent make those choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6771.59s">If</a> that superintendent told us that they had flexibility in coming forward, I'm sure Mr. Belson can give <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6780.648s">the</a> information, but the final decision, even restructuring of the central administration, you know, putting those positions back in place, I think that should be the new superintendent's place. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6792.214s">I</a> don't think that a new superintendent should step in and, you know, have to work with what's been hired from an outgoing superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6801.178s">His</a> input can be done by June 30th, and then the new superintendent should have the final decision.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6856.368s">So,</a> Mayor Burke, can I answer that question about the director of foreign language? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6860.909s">For</a> instance, so say the new superintendent wants our foreign languages to develop in a different road than we currently have in MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6873.133s">Maybe</a> a different language. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6875.053s">So</a> say the new director of foreign language teaches <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6882.033s">a</a> program that we might not be moving forward for for the next five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6886.721s">I</a> would hate for that to happen when the new superintendent, like she talked about Mandarin in one of her interviews, I remember her. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6895.135s">speaking</a> about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6896.175s">So</a> she might have a new direction and new programs in her mind of how to move MedFit forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6902.797s">And</a> if we hire someone in a role that has what we currently have and what not our future is going to be, we could be tying our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6913.4s">So</a> that's why the importance of not hiring directors are important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6918.741s">So</a> I really would like <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=6921.616s">to</a> either let her make those decisions on, you know, bring the finalists to her, maybe do the preliminary work, but really have some more input from the new superintendent and what her vision for our school district is gonna be rather than the outgoing superintendent, and someone have to work within those restraints.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7214.387s">Um,</a> a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7215.708s">Number</a> one, can we get a list of those positions that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7219.788s">are</a> necessary to move forward so that—I know we asked for a list of retirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7226.152s">It</a> wasn't added to the back of the agenda for reports, so we had asked for a list of retirements or open positions for next year, so that would be helpful for us to know what interviews are happening, what's going on, because, like, I did not have any idea that those interviews were happening for the foreign language department at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7248.5s">That</a> would be helpful as committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7250.842s">Also,</a> I'd like to, through you, to address the superintendent about the rumors that he plans on staying after June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7258.288s">Is</a> that your intention, Mr. Belson?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=7263.312s">Reporting</a> on rumors.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8337.721s">To</a> be clear and transparent, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8343.104s">It's</a> been a long night. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8344.625s">I</a> just want you to know, this didn't come out at that meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8348.066s">We</a> didn't pull out this paperwork and read the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8351.758s">Because</a> if we had, we would have went down to the assistant superintendent when the deputy said that she wasn't able to take that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8359.903s">I</a> didn't bring it forward because I was floored by what was being proposed to me at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8364.866s">It</a> didn't enter my mind until someone asked me for a copy of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8368.489s">And</a> I went, oh my gosh, I can't believe I didn't bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8371.971s">And</a> our new members probably have never seen this or read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8375.673s">So</a> yeah, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8378.135s">This</a> should have been implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8379.776s">I'm</a> surprised it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8381.988s">I</a> would have loved to seen this implemented because I know Mr. Belson wouldn't have left us hanging and he would still be there for vital information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8389.613s">And</a> I made that point at that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8391.334s">So</a> I'm being transparent about what I did and what I didn't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8394.836s">I</a> didn't bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8395.977s">I</a> didn't think about this item. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8397.938s">This</a> should have been implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8399.359s">This</a> is our policy that we voted on when you brought it forward, when I left you hanging that night, and I apologize for, because I should have said something that evening as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8410.52s">So</a> I own what I've done, and I'm going to try to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8414.841s">So,</a> you know, that's all I can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8418.582s">And</a> we need to make sure that, you know, we have people like you reminding us, hey, we did this, because we can't remember everything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=8510.627s">I</a> was just waiting for the wording.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9805.394s">Yeah,</a> I'm just trying to help clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9809.156s">I</a> believe it was a company that was coming in and offering a specific program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9816.224s">That</a> is there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9820.665s">That's</a> there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=9825.787s">Odyssey</a> of the Mind.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10453.743s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10454.883s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10457.225s">There's</a> a lot of good ideas and a lot of things we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10459.806s">What</a> we need is what we discussed with our candidates, is a short-term plan for next year, and we need to look at the bigger environment, because other than bodies, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10472.389s">There</a> are a lot of different things that we need to do, but I don't think doing that in May for September is feasible right now, even though I agree with your long-term idea, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10482.535s">Because</a> I think that will handle a lot of the other demographics that need to be addressed, but I don't think we'll have enough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10491.641s">I</a> like your idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10492.761s">I</a> don't want to target one school to stay there, because I think opening it up, as you suggested, is gonna be, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10501.57s">more</a> productive for our community and not targeting people directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10507.194s">And</a> I liked what you said about clinging to people on your microphone and saying, please step up now because we do need this help. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10516.742s">We</a> don't want to make these decisions for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10519.304s">We</a> want parents to be a partner with us deciding how to handle this situation that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=10525.869s">And</a> that's all I really have to say.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11386.653s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11387.693s">First</a> of all, the mayor has said that she's been working on this for months, and this is the first that this body is hearing of this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11395.468s">There</a> is such a lack of information given to us this night. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11401.817s">When</a> will they be using our facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11403.68s">How</a> much money will they be providing? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11405.463s">How</a> many courses will our teachers get to take? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11408.027s">This</a> one-page thing does not tell me anything about this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11412.609s">And</a> if we need to act quickly, then maybe we should have heard about it before the middle of May. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11418.813s">I'm</a> sorry, but I'm really not happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11420.994s">And</a> we're trying to talk about security. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11423.835s">Is</a> this for their games? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11425.296s">Is</a> there going to be spectators in our school gyms? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11428.317s">When</a> will they be played? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11430.058s">How</a> is security going to be handled? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11432.179s">This</a> is a big commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11433.92s">This</a> isn't a one-pager at the end of a night <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11437.482s">So</a> I would like to table this discussion until we have more information from the district so that we can review a lot more questions and not have this brought before us in this manner at this late time of the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11450.63s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11453.752s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=11456.973s">I</a> said no.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12969.82s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12973.163s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12973.963s">I</a> also want to thank you for all your years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12976.325s">You</a> were my daughter's teacher.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12981.169s">And</a> you were very tough, very fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12985.232s">They</a> learned a tremendous amount that they carried forward with them, not only to college, but in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12992.717s">I</a> appreciate that as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=12994.963s">And</a> as an administrator, you have always been very receptive to the committee and any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13001.369s">And</a> thank you for all your years of service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13005.053s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13005.453s">It's</a> been a privilege.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13235.099s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13235.959s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13237.58s">Motion</a> to accept this award. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13239.4s">I</a> always want to take in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13242.681s">And</a> thank, could we send a letter of thanks to the foundation? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13247.04s">as</a> well as invite the junior class members to our next meeting that will be receiving these awards, just so we can honor them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13273.272s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13662.763s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13663.743s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13664.844s">That's</a> run out of the special education department is my understanding under Kathy Medaglio and that student services. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13674.269s">I</a> know because at my school, I'm the trainer in safety care and in CPI. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13682.373s">So</a> what happens is that you need a team of teachers that are able to respond to an emergency situation so you can be called away. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13691.655s">And</a> a gym teacher or a physical education teacher or other specialists are usually on that team because they have the most flexibility in their schedule and can respond very quickly to different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13707.262s">Whereas</a> a classroom teacher might have at any given time 20 students in their care and not be able to respond easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13716.238s">I</a> call them classroom teachers because they do teach classes of children, but they just have a little bit more flexibility about being around the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=13730.202s">And</a> they're alone sometimes in different areas of the building, so it's good to have them trained.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14308.495s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14310.756s">Do</a> you happen to have a breakdown of the additional security costs since we added the dual monitors?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14338.95s">I</a> was just wondering what the total cost was that, and I don't know how difficult that'd be for you to get to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14344.633s">Just</a> an idea so that we can use that figure to pre-plan for next year, if that's the route that we're gonna go. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14351.197s">It</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14353.498s">Also,</a> could you provide us a copy of the last audit? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14356.48s">I</a> know it was requested at one of our... It is just being finalized right now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14367.814s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14368.414s">Um,</a> so can we have that on the requested reports list, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14371.816s">The,</a> um, a copy of the audit, the last financial audit. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14377.58s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14378.3s">And,</a> um, while we were talking about security, it brought up a question that is really not for you, um, miss Patterson. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14385.965s">Thank</a> you though. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14386.966s">Um,</a> it's for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14388.186s">Could</a> she please, could you please, with all respect, give us an update on the report from the Martha Coakley law firm.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14412.252s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14412.612s">And</a> a follow-up, it's not so much a financial follow-up, but a few more reports that were requested that weren't on the requester reports list. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14421.259s">So</a> while I was talking about it, I thought I'd bring it up to Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14426.423s">A</a> report on the traffic pattern at the pool door so that way we can make determinations if we're moving that person at nine o'clock in the morning down to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14437.505s">Could</a> you add that to the list so that can be provided to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14440.966s">It's</a> just a tally, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14443.406s">The</a> community school usage I just received now. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14447.727s">So</a> I'll look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14449.168s">I</a> mean, we got this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14450.728s">This</a> has all the rentals for the community schools for the year, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14454.029s">Is</a> that what this report is?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14471.78s">No,</a> I appreciate you having it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14473.3s">I'm</a> gonna look at it, and if I have any questions, I'll bring them up at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14477.602s">I</a> just wanted to say thank you for providing that for us, and I know the financial report on that is coming up next. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14487.352s">Mr.</a> Belson's report on the cost analyst feasibility study for the items suggested on the building and grounds meeting, that report is not listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14500.2s">Remember,</a> Roy, you were talking about giving us a feasibility study and prices for the buildings and grounds items that were suggested.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14520.725s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14525.146s">Yeah,</a> and I just want to announce them so everybody knows as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14528.147s">In</a> requested number of bullying reports completed by school, that was requested by someone I noticed in the minutes that wasn't added to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14539.172s">Bullying</a> reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14541.833s">The</a> number by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14543.558s">And</a> again, the list of retirements coming forward, so that way we have that data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14553.082s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14553.682s">I</a> really appreciate the report you provided to us on the finance budget and the time that your department took to present this to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14562.706s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14564.947s">Motion</a> to approve report and place on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=14583.851s">That's</a> insurance coverage for the school district.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15178.595s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15181.237s">So</a> I went by each item. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15185.705s">I</a> found it easy to do it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15188.408s">So</a> with Edgerly Field, I took the total deposits of $142,374.50, and then the expenses that were listed were $162,916, which means a difference of $20,000, a little bit more, in the red. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15213.54s">but</a> we had money in the account prior to that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15216.302s">So</a> we're not really in the red in that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15218.804s">Does</a> that include the bond and the insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15223.588s">Because</a> I know- The bond and the interest, yes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15226.71s">I</a> know a few years ago we got into a little trouble with that and the city helped us out and I'm glad to see that added in. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15232.515s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15232.815s">I</a> just want to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15236.178s">I</a> just want to make sure that the revenue coming in, that we're really having everybody pay for all the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15244.267s">I'd</a> also like to see the personnel in the payroll issues listed when we get these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15252.391s">I</a> know that's a lot and I don't know if that's easy to do or not easy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15257.934s">And</a> I got the usage, that was my other note. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15260.916s">You</a> provided us with the usage of who's on Edgeley Field as well as any buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15267.419s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15267.999s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15270.783s">And</a> you know what I really was hoping to see in part of this is donations of use time on our fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15279.127s">Like</a> a list of people in the community, we donate time on the fields, on our buildings, because that's a PR thing, like we care about the community, we donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15292.774s">I</a> know Mr. Maloney definitely provides many people in our community time, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15300.057s">to</a> use our facilities and donated, and that was part of the computer program that I had hoped we would get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15306.021s">And</a> maybe that's in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15306.942s">I</a> just haven't had a chance tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15308.883s">There's</a> been so many goings on to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15312.066s">So</a> maybe someone could clarify that for me if that's in this or how that's being tracked, because that was requested a couple times throughout the years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15342.293s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15345.136s">Just</a> in general in the future, I mean, people tell me all the time about different things going on <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15352.004s">I</a> don't see some of those things listed, so that's why I thought they were more of donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15357.846s">So</a> we can move on to the athletic revenue expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15361.907s">So</a> I just wanted to be forthright and clear, the income for the athletics department was $81,974.25, and the expenses were $93,044.78, so the difference there is $11,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15380.969s">but</a> that's not the end of the year, like you said, the gate things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15386.636s">And</a> as far as employees for the athletics department, they're usually under the school employee people and not generally listed under athletics in this capacity.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15403.84s">Right,</a> just getting through it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15407.24s">And</a> then community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15408.981s">So</a> this is the biggest amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15414.662s">So</a> my first question is AIC, Japanese schools, the church, those ones that you listed, we don't know what those amounts are, and we also don't know when those payments are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15429.44s">Could</a> you provide us some of the information?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15441.388s">Do</a> you mind just telling us an update as those go out, so just like when they went out, how much they're being charged, and how that affects their budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15453.456s">Also,</a> the community school's income is 201,146.41, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15459.12s">The</a> expenses here are only $18,310.08, if I did my numbers right. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15465.383s">So</a> the total income is $191,836, is that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15481.551s">That</a> does not include the payroll? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15483.271s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15484.352s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15485.258s">Could</a> we get that number when we get the updated list of people? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15488.44s">That</a> would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15489.481s">And</a> maybe just add it to this so we see it all at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15493.103s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15494.784s">Moving</a> forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15500.308s">I</a> also thought that there was a theater group that was using the high school theater at the same time that the high school musical was trying to be put on, because I think they rented it, or I don't know if it was donated, <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15512.89s">I</a> think some of our other members' children were in that program, so I don't know the name of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15517.653s">There</a> was a theater group that was being, they were practicing up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15522.657s">Mr.</a> Belson, do you know about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15529.161s">But</a> their practices were at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15532.803s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15534.785s">Oh,</a> there was some production up at the high school using the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15541.569s">Was</a> it an Arlington group? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15546.211s">Oh,</a> it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15549.192s">So</a> there was an Arlington group that using the Karen Theater, and I'm assuming that they rented it out, and there were conflict in timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15564.715s">We</a> got an email about this, Mr. Maloney, about the high school kids when they were, a parent sent it to us.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15615.523s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15616.024s">Thank</a> you for reaching out to that parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15617.884s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15619.065s">Um,</a> what Arlington group is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15620.525s">Cause</a> I don't see it listed as, um, on the community school rental.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15627.308s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15644.78s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15646.521s">I'd</a> appreciate that very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15648.021s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15648.602s">And</a> so with what was presented, there is the $191,836 in this area, and other than the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15662.228s">personnel.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15663.449s">We'll</a> come back to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15664.75s">We'll</a> come back to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15666.872s">We'll</a> just table it until we get that additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15671.676s">I'm</a> almost done, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15674.939s">The</a> La Conte rank, the income is $157,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15677.341s">I'm</a> having trouble reading my writing this late. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15678.842s">And</a> the expenses are $227,049.63 with <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15692.595s">a</a> difference of $69,449. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15693.756s">I</a> know that this is a benefit to have a rink in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15703.06s">I</a> don't know if we can advertise more rink time or how we can help change that deficit, and maybe it will change by the end of this 17? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15715.425s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15720.348s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15721.738s">And</a> the last one is the pool, which is income of $149,025.50 and expenses of $173,657 with a difference of $24,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15727.059s">And</a> I don't think that's terrible considering all the extra security over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15730.08s">Was</a> that allocated to the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15731.24s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15748.488s">So</a> I think that's pretty good because we knew when we opened those pools that it was going to be a tight thing because of the cost of running a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15756.251s">So,</a> and I think it's a value to our students and to the community, well worth the investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15763.513s">I</a> just want to thank you for providing me with these reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15766.774s">And</a> if you could follow up with those few questions, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15770.795s">And</a> thank you for staying so late to answer some of these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15774.317s">I</a> really do appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15776.478s">having</a> a good understanding of this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15779.22s">So</a> any extra money, how is that allocated? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15782.403s">Where</a> does it go to? <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15783.183s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C2svyKx7vRU&t=15787.167s">So</a> do we have a balance in that account?<h2><a href="../2018-05-04_o9F0qYH9Geo/2018-05-04_o9F0qYH9Geo.html">Scenario Interviews for Finalists for Superintendent of Medford Public Schools 05/03/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1823.744s">Just</a> a point of history, Medgard was one of the first schools in Massachusetts to have full day kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1831.209s">So</a> I would love us to offer a pre-K program and really push the state towards university pre-K. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1837.113s">I</a> feel like that's the foundation of education and I would love to be on the forefront of that within the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1844.217s">And</a> I do like you thinking outside of the box because we have <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1848.54s">someone</a> had brought a suggestion to us to make one middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1854.125s">And</a> that was something that I was interested in at that point, a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1858.148s">Someone</a> had suggested that, we had talked about that as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1863.132s">The</a> buildings itself would have to be changed because the bathrooms, it was not cost effective, but this is a different way to look at that, and I really, <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1874.341s">It's</a> very interesting and very intriguing to me as a planer. <a href="https://youtu.be/o9F0qYH9Geo&t=1878.025s">Yes,</a> it would be a long-term plan, but I think it's a great plan.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=802.747s">This</a> particular playground is a little different, because it's a community playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=805.949s">It's</a> the only lit playground in the area, so that really justifies this being a community project, and that benefits the school children as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=814.112s">So</a> we're looking for a community project for that neighborhood that also benefits the 600 children in the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=821.336s">So</a> it does both. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=822.936s">There's</a> only eight hours that the school really takes use of this, and there's 24 hours in a day, so there's a lot of the community that can use it other than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=832.3s">As</a> far as the capital improvement plan, I think that question would be best answered by Mayor Burke directly, because we're still working on those priorities, especially with the new superintendent coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=845.964s">Some</a> of those changes might come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=849.025s">We</a> do have a grant application out as well within the community for improvements, especially at our high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=856.812s">So</a> we are always working on improvement and capital improvements throughout the school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=863.337s">But</a> this is a great opportunity not only to help the school, but also help the whole community in that area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=870.383s">Anything</a> else? <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=871.264s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/I5lIrWN8Vh8&t=871.624s">Good.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0/2018-04-10_vqZ0fsWQ1g0.html">Medford School Committee meeting April 9, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=93.941s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=94.762s">I</a> just did have one comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=96.142s">I</a> did notice that there was a request for a report of who will be in charge of monitoring and keeping the online PTO, PTG friends of organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=108.346s">Like</a> who in the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=111.216s">You're</a> going to, just on a report list, on the back of the report list, during our meeting last time, we asked that someone be assigned <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=124.558s">the</a> role of implementing or overseeing the PTO, PTG, new online thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=132.524s">Like</a> who an administration or what administrative assistant or executive assistant.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=139.009s">Yeah,</a> so I just wanted you to add it to the report list so that way we don't forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=143.232s">Not</a> that I forget anything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=149.177s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=150.889s">It's</a> the website page that organizations will be starting in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=154.871s">So</a> that was the only thing I saw from the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=158.473s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=192.982s">I</a> did have one question on the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=195.123s">On</a> page, I don't know if Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=197.503s">Patterson</a> has a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=200.064s">On</a> page nine of 14, there is a, it says trustees of Boston College for $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=208.625s">It</a> says Nellie Mae Foundation unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=211.602s">I</a> just don't know what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=212.683s">I</a> don't think I've seen it before.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=253.532s">Oh,</a> so the Nellie Mae Foundation is who he partnered with?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=272.122s">Yeah,</a> I know that Boston College got the $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=276.985s">What</a> was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=277.726s">How</a> did that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=278.346s">What</a> was it about? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=279.047s">Could</a> you just?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=287.974s">OK,</a> so he won this award, won $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=291.817s">He</a> used that to have Boston College come in and do a program with our students, and this is just the payment for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=298.121s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=299.142s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=299.822s">I'd</a> just like to get the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=301.663s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=306.004s">Motion</a> to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=306.924s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=594.644s">Yep,</a> you're welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=596.025s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=596.185s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=597.565s">Kathy,</a> I like these reports because they bring out some questions I'd like to ask the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=602.646s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=605.527s">So</a> I'd like an update on the cafe and when it's opening, the bistro, rather, the bistro. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=613.278s">So</a> use the cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=614.419s">Bistro</a> 489. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=615.941s">Where</a> are we with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=617.622s">And</a> when can people go up there and have lunch and hang out on the deck?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=670.387s">Thank</a> you for the update.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=691.87s">Motion</a> to accept both reports and place them on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=695.391s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=968.074s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=968.915s">It</a> was a really great meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=970.617s">I</a> appreciate all the work on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=973.339s">And</a> these suggestions, I'd like them to move a lot of these suggestions forward directly to our Buildings and Grounds Director, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=983.529s">to</a> the numbers on the doors, those are minimal cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=988.271s">And</a> doing those type of facility upgrades and have a date for them to be set up for September maybe if you can, I don't know, get our team together over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=998.395s">Just</a> put some goals in place and date timelines on them and what our next steps are and when we're gonna meet again to go over everything and make sure that all follow through has happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1010.72s">But</a> the ideas that came out and whether or not we use ALICE or STARS or another program, we do need a program district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1019.802s">I</a> feel like we should all be using the same language. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1022.443s">I</a> feel like we all need to have the same number of looks on every building from K through 12 district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1033.142s">things</a> implemented so that everybody, as they're moving up, if you learn it in third grade, you know it in fourth grade, you know it in fifth grade, so you're just constantly getting the same information year after year, and it's second thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1047.026s">And</a> we label things, the words. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1049.406s">We</a> use the words of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1051.687s">I</a> think that's the most important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1054.127s">So</a> through you to the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1056.675s">about</a> moving this to security, moving it to facilities, that's my motion on the floor, and to put some date timelines on this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1182.159s">That</a> would be best. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1182.999s">And</a> I think my name goes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1187.777s">So</a> now you're on that committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1188.957s">No,</a> you're on the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1189.818s">It's</a> you and me. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1190.438s">It's</a> listed above.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1393.654s">Point</a> of clarification, I think my colleague is asking for a monitor just like at all the other schools, so they can buzz people in.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1490.67s">Wait,</a> can I have a point of clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1492.471s">Are</a> you asking for an additional person, or just the visual monitor so the secretary can buzz them in and read them?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1529.852s">Wait</a> one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1531.133s">I</a> got it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1532.895s">My</a> second part of that question is so during the school day is is it <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1538.059s">best</a> to have that pool door security person down at the Vogue to deal with the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1546.925s">Rather</a> than have them at the pool door during the school day, have them at the vocational door. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1552.569s">And</a> if people need to come into the pool, they can go down to the vocational and walk to the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1558.473s">I</a> mean, it might work better rather than elderly walking through our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1564.036s">That's</a> a way to look at it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1600.404s">So</a> to follow up, can we do one week a tally, how many people are coming through the pool door during school hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1611.265s">just</a> to get an idea of how many people are actually using that, and if that person could be used more efficiently for customers and school departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1623.209s">So</a> my issue is we don't want to make it so that people aren't coming and using our vocational programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1630.651s">We</a> want people to come in and get their hair done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1632.632s">I</a> actually brought my mother there at one point, and my sister got their hair done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1636.233s">And</a> I got my hair done when I had a broken wrist. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1639.174s">And</a> they do your nails, they do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1641.235s">You</a> can get an oil change, your hair done. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1644.197s">You</a> can get so many things done up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1646.779s">You</a> can spend the whole day and have lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1650.041s">So</a> a motion to do a study till the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1655.785s">And</a> maybe a representative for the district can report that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1663.23s">And</a> maybe even the people at the front desk can get some feedback.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1859.583s">My</a> final comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1861.503s">So</a> I understand that we rent the pool and a lot of people use it early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1866.425s">And</a> I think, I know, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1868.508s">from</a> what the impression I'm getting from the superintendent is that he wants to make sure those people coming in and going out are signed in or let in appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1877.836s">And</a> if that's the case, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1879.277s">But</a> then maybe when that rental stops during the morning, that person shifts over to the Vogue so that way when someone's coming up to get her hair done, she doesn't have to walk off him, walk through the whole building and cause that <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=1897.693s">to</a> lose customers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2552.144s">Motion</a> to accept the report and place it on file?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2630.662s">Yes,</a> I'd like to make a motion to accept these, but at the same time, I'd like to add two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2636.827s">I'd</a> like to define <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2638.43s">how</a> a new employee is hired within that rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2642.271s">I</a> would like to change the rule and just define new employee as someone hired within the last six months so that it's interpreted by everybody on the same level.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2660.157s">Make</a> a motion so that when the new contract is written, employees more definitely <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2668.487s">stated.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2688.033s">So</a> my second motion would be to receive a payroll report either by annually or annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2693.682s">as</a> of December 31st, just so we have a chance to review it, because we vote on payroll on a weekly, bi-weekly, at all of our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2704.089s">So</a> I think that we should put our eyes on the data twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2708.191s">And</a> I was thinking December 31st and June 31st, just to see how it falls within our budget book, and so we can compare the two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2716.717s">Does</a> that mean two days?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2719.438s">For</a> the two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2720.819s">December</a> 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2723.542s">And</a> the second day would be June. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2727.403s">We</a> can do 15th rather than the end of the month, because it gets, you know, everybody's gone by then.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2735.906s">A</a> payroll report with year-to-date information included on December 31st of every year and June 1st of every year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2754.974s">Yeah,</a> payroll lending is close to December 31st.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2760.178s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2761.539s">Thank</a> you for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2762.86s">Yeah,</a> you knew exactly what I would mean.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2764.821s">Vander</a> Kloof.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2779.477s">We</a> could add it to the year end, but it's just good to see before we wrote on budget how funds can be allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2787.94s">If</a> we're on track with payroll at the end of each year, or if we find a need for more stipends or more substitutes or more anything, we can incorporate that in and make those changes before we approve our next year's budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2933.513s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2933.933s">We</a> can talk about it the next following meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2935.695s">As</a> long as we get the report, we can then disseminate it and bring any questions forward from that point on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2945.982s">Oh,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=2946.362s">If</a> they even email it to us, if we see concerns, we can email major concerns and then talk about it early September.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3022.153s">Well,</a> that's why we need more data on the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3128.854s">And</a> that's in addition to all the other recommendations that were placed in this report as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3142.5s">And,</a> um, you know, I just, I just want to comment that I appreciated the reports coming forward from the finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3153.004s">Um,</a> I know it took a lot of work, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3155.768s">But</a> it's important as a committee member to make sure that what I vote for, I get to see the background information. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3163.454s">So</a> I have a whole picture in my mind, and that way I'm confident in voting, especially when people's tax dollars are being allocated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3172.78s">So</a> thank you to the department for the time you invested. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3177.097s">to</a> provide me that information, and thank you for moving forward in a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3181.9s">Also,</a> the list of, I thought that was really good that came out of that meeting, is the list of salary changes as which negotiations have been completed, being in the front of our budget book, so when we look back six months, a year from now, we know which <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3205.132s">salary</a> increases were in our budget book and which were left out, so that way we have a better understanding and an easier knowledge to just make sure that we're making the correct choices moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3217.779s">And</a> thank you for all of the committee for their time, adding another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3228.285s">And</a> there's another piece of this report about the <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3232.663s">four</a> finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3234.264s">I</a> don't know if you want to comment on it before we accept it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3281.815s">Motion</a> was to accept the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3287.558s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3302.577s">A</a> motion for my new documents.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3311.201s">And</a> we voted on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3329.682s">Before</a> Cheryl starts her report, I just wanted to also commend Cheryl for all the work that she's doing with the CPA report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3337.666s">She's</a> still continuing to provide the application process under CPA to get us a little more than $100,000 to redo the ground covering of our playground <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3351.994s">at</a> the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3354.535s">I</a> said it right this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3357.555s">And</a> it's looking good, but we still have some more hoops to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3361.836s">I</a> think we have a meeting on April 24th in the evening that Cheryl's going to speak at. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3371.198s">And</a> I'm going to go and root behind her. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=3373.198s">And</a> anybody else on the committee that wants to come and root for that money, we could really use your support.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4058.422s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4059.522s">I</a> agree that we get a lot of emails and phone calls about bullying in our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4065.844s">I'm</a> not sure that every principal or person in our district is really filling out these forms in an equal, you know, everybody might be doing it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4080.447s">So</a> I think it's something that needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4083.767s">And</a> maybe we can do an online form <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4086.544s">similar</a> to the PTO form so that way we can really see in the district if there is areas that need extra help and we can put extra people there to make those changes happen or like a crisis team if there's a need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4101.994s">But</a> I don't believe that curriculum is the subcommittee I would pick and that's what I was on my phone doing trying to look at a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4109.043s">Groupings</a> and which one this might fit in. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4112.625s">And</a> I think rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4113.726s">We</a> need to have rules in the school of how people treat each other and how people react. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4118.569s">And</a> when people aren't following the rules, then we need to have policies and procedures in place that are very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4124.633s">This</a> is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4125.533s">This</a> is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4126.754s">And</a> once you pass this point, this is your discipline for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4130.977s">We</a> need to go to that point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4139.845s">I</a> think it's a big enough issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4144.126s">But</a> my other point is do we have staffs, these are from my notes from the paperwork earlier, do we have staffs of bullying completed for this year and do we collect them from the different schools and do we keep them in a central administration and how are they reviewed so that way the beginning of next year, last year's aren't just thrown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4165.171s">Do</a> we know that this child <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4166.851s">who</a> is bullying is clearly needing help. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4169.433s">And</a> are we getting them that help so that the bullying no longer continues? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4173.395s">Like,</a> there's a need there. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4174.976s">And</a> if we're not meeting that need, that the behavior is going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4178.278s">So</a> we need to track it not only yearly, but year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4183.821s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4184.422s">My</a> brain's fried for words. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4185.982s">But</a> you get what I mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4188.804s">So</a> I would suggest it goes to the rules committees instead.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4955.16s">So</a> next is a motion to accept the report and place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4961.265s">So</a> moved.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4970.392s">All</a> those opposed, none. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=4972.573s">Let's</a> go.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5114.197s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5114.397s">Caldwell,</a> do you have a timeline for the presenting the survey results?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5136.75s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5137.951s">I'll</a> just add it to the reports list, and when you get a second to present it, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5142.513s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5143.254s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5457.309s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5459.111s">I</a> think at one point we possibly talked about hiring retired teachers to come back because they have the skill set already and because it's part time. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5467.855s">But</a> by making them employees, they hold to, rather than volunteers, they hold to a set schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5478.303s">It's</a> a job and not just, oh, I can't make it today, when the children need these services.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5491.252s">And</a> maybe even hiring students from <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5496.313s">some</a> of the local colleges that have majors in elementary that are also trying to afford to live in our area might also be a good way to look at that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5509.304s">So,</a> yeah, and I really, I spoke last year at budget time over the importance of RTI and offered, you know, and you said you would track it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5519.372s">I</a> appreciate all the work that is going into this and I hope to see <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5525.942s">you</a> know, maybe a number that you need us to help you with to move forward and really help our students raise their scores in their learning ability as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5535.051s">That's</a> the key more than anything else.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5538.014s">You</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5538.695s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5539.256s">Thanks.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=5860.805s">Can</a> I just make a motion to accept the reports that Dr. Kaye has brought forward?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6574.086s">Just</a> a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6575.447s">Would</a> you consider bringing in another program as well as FOSS, moving FOSS to a different school, see if you get the same kind of information, and then
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6668.686s">And</a> find out? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6669.106s">It's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6669.607s">Good</a> to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6670.708s">We</a> respect what you bring forward to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=6674.872s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7433.643s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7434.884s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7435.964s">A</a> few of our programs that we did for math and writing, we were able to spread out that cost for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7443.027s">So</a> that way the district could afford to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7446.989s">I'm</a> sure you're negotiating with Voss and going to work us a really good deal.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7454.452s">Are</a> there any surrounding districts that are also interested in it that we could marry together and get a better deal?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7486.744s">I'm</a> not sure whether I can leverage it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7487.704s">And</a> I know that buy-in bulk works usually. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7489.526s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7490.603s">especially</a> with hands-on materials as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7494.086s">So</a> sometimes districts have to do that in order to afford the best that we can offer our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7499.591s">But</a> my other question is, how is DESE done with changing the curriculum requirements for
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7512.286s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7802.808s">Motion</a> to accept the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=7804.89s">All</a> those in favor?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8328.299s">Thank</a> you for the report, and I motion to place the report and put it on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8335.766s">I</a> have a budget question or request. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8339.369s">through</a> you to the superintendent, do you think that you could prepare for us a list of known retirements coming up so we have an idea of staffing changes so that we don't get them so close to the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8353.905s">book</a> coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8355.906s">I</a> know that we all know of some retirements happening soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8359.568s">And</a> as a committee, we need to add an item to the agenda like who is going to be the interim superintendent and those types of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8368.012s">So</a> I'm making a request that that be added to the agenda for our next meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8394.464s">No,</a> I just mean known, meaning known to us as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8399.768s">Also</a> the motion to add that agenda item for our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8404.911s">So</a> we know steps moving forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8412.719s">My</a> motion is to add an agenda item to discuss next steps as the superintendent retires on April 30th.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8429.187s">Who's</a> stepping in as you retire? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8431.569s">Who's</a> going to step up for the rest of the school year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8435.632s">No,</a> I'm adding, I'm asking it to be added to the agenda so that way we can discuss it with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8443.199s">That's</a> my, uh, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8444.12s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8444.5s">A</a> transition plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8445.241s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8472.453s">Also,</a> some emails were going back and forth with regards to an update on the gun clip at the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8481.928s">Suggested</a> I ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8483.589s">I</a> know she's not here so I can wait to ask it But then we got an email today as a committee also asking us to add it to the agenda So that way the community knows about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8495.093s">I</a> know the mayor's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8496.914s">I'm</a> making an official request whether or not it will be on the agenda is
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8509.662s">Any</a> reports, any financials that are available that we can, or any timeline, any information that we can provide this committee as well as our community on updates would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8523.193s">And</a> I'd like that added to the agenda.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8548.147s">The</a> administration from the school district, someone representing the committee or the school district, just making a phone call and say, is, is it completed yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8557.553s">Do</a> you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8558.773s">a</a> problem, an estimated time frame is more than what I anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8564.496s">Just</a> so we can give the community an update, because everywhere I go, whatever room I walk in, I was at an event for Representative Donato the other night, and six people, the first thing they said to me was, do we have an idea of the reports?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8817.216s">At</a> a certain point, if we can't meet staffing needs, we need to be able to come together as a community and maybe bring in, outsource it. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8827.4s">I</a> know that at my district, that's what we came to. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8830.781s">We</a> were having trouble with just finding people to come in two or three days a week, so the Boys and Girls Club, <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8838.268s">came</a> in and ran the program in our buildings and did it in that form. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8843.452s">If</a> we can't meet the need, I mean, it's something to look at in the future if we're having trouble meeting the need. <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8850.578s">Just</a> an idea.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8922.945s">So</a> just for clarification, will we get an update by the end of the school year, so we'll have something in place, or at least be able to talk to parents?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/vqZ0fsWQ1g0&t=8932.668s">Thank</a> you, I appreciate that.<h2><a href="../2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0/2018-04-05_TayqV05M2I0.html">Medford School Committee - Superintendent Interviews - Night 2 - 04/04/18</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=73.722s">Here.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1460.588s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1461.348s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1462.309s">Nice</a> to meet you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1464.511s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1465.611s">My</a> first question is pretty specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1469.615s">I'm</a> sure you looked at some of our data. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1472.166s">And</a> what is your plan to increase the academic growth at each level of our educational system? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1479.65s">So</a> our elementary, middle, and high school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1486.773s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1487.373s">To</a> increase academic scores or rigor in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1491.115s">Like</a> if you saw by looking at our data areas that you felt that needed growth and attention at this point, and what kind of ideas do you have to help us? <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1499.98s">I</a> saw in your resume that you were able to bring schools up to level one. <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=1505.803s">And</a> just the type of things, based on our data, if you had a chance to look at that, if you had any specific ideas or examples.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4687.66s">So</a> speaking of vision, do you have a district vision for MedFed, or an idea of what you think <a href="https://youtu.be/TayqV05M2I0&t=4694.414s">that</a> you would like to see us, how you would like to see us grow?

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=124.009s">I</a> had a few questions on page 5 of 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=130.236s">Third</a> item down, it says Motty's Caterers, and then the account description says Textbooks DW. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=137.265s">I'm</a> sure it was just maybe an error. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=139.667s">I</a> don't think we're paying Motty's Caterers for textbooks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=159.293s">OK,</a> and the other one is on the next page, page six of 10, about 10 items down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=166.754s">It</a> says North Shore Rental, Inc. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=168.775s">And</a> it also says Textbooks DW. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=173.375s">Other</a> than that, they look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=175.376s">So</a> I think it just could have been clicked differently or some easy error. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=180.737s">Oh,</a> someone has something to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=184.748s">Bernadette</a> raised her hand like she wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=187.51s">Mrs.</a> Riccadeli. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=217.579s">So</a> will we get a correction on that when the money's transferred from one?

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=380.341s">Right,</a> in that budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=382.225s">This</a> book that was approved was including those increases for all staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=387.706s">And</a> not all staff received the increase, so everybody would receive an increase, and that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=393.347s">The</a> differences are random. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=395.848s">Some</a> people got them, and some others didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=398.168s">So</a> it would make sense to me if everybody got a step increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=404.37s">But</a> some people, it looks like it could be two or three steps, and some people are one step, and some people have no raise increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=411.855s">So</a> it's concerning, and we're responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=415.836s">We</a> vote on this payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=416.996s">We</a> should know what is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=419.037s">And</a> I'm not a CPA, but I put a spreadsheet together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=422.798s">I</a> didn't look at longevity or overtime, because those are listed out separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=427.899s">I</a> just looked at base pay, because that's what I have in our budget book, and I compared them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=432.76s">And</a> I took the salary for that week, multiplied it by 26, which would be the annual income, because I didn't get the year-to-date column. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=440.869s">So</a> I just, and I clarified that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=444.19s">I</a> sent you an email saying, hey, do I multiply this by 24? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=447.251s">Are</a> we bi-monthly or are we bi-weekly? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=451.732s">So</a> you said we would buy things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=453.873s">So</a> I, late last night, I did it on Excel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=457.514s">I</a> put the gross wages you sent me, the PDF. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=460.435s">I</a> transferred it to an Excel document. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=463.816s">I</a> made a formula at taking the gross wages, multiplied it by 26, and got that column. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=470.327s">I</a> kept the check date so that way everybody knew exactly what pay period it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=475.77s">Then</a> I put in the budget book salary for the people that I checked that I saw differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=482.853s">Some</a> people aren't being paid enough, and some people are overpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=488.076s">And</a> I don't want to say names, so I will, like for instance, I will use initials so you can follow along. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=493.598s">It's</a> all alphabetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=495.459s">So</a> like on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=497.475s">Fourth</a> page down, last name C, first name K, it's highlighted so you should be able to find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=503.617s">Their</a> weekly pay rate was $19.4742. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=506.717s">If</a> you multiply that by 26 to get the annual, it should be $50,632.92. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=510.178s">The</a> budget book that we approved, their raise included, should be $46,138. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=526.227s">There's</a> a difference that that person possibly could be overpaid by $4,494 based on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=533.711s">That's</a> not including overtime or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=537.593s">And</a> I have 19 examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=539.954s">I</a> would have done more, but again, I didn't start this till late yesterday because I got it Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=546.438s">I</a> had my aunt and I had <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=549.453s">wedding</a> dress shopping, which was a lot of fun.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=569.285s">Yes,</a> and I have changes that Ms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=573.068s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=589.86s">And</a> what I also have is in June 19th of last year, after the budget was approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=599.109s">Mr.</a> Belson came to a school committee meeting and we went into executive session and he brought forth a list of people he requested 2.5% raises on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=610.375s">And</a> I have those lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=613.096s">Some</a> of them were principals, people who are not under union that he would need to do this for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=620.28s">Some</a> of them were administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=623.922s">Yours</a> was one of them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=627.644s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=628.812s">He</a> also came forward for some confidential secretaries or administrative assistants that he brought forward that he felt needed to be brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=639.917s">And</a> they're not in bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=641.998s">They're,</a> you know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=642.918s">And</a> they've all been documented with personnel.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=645.419s">And</a> so I have all those documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=647.1s">So</a> the ones that I'm talking about in these differences are union people who only should be going up the step and some have and some haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=656.518s">It</a> should be all or none, because they're in line with the collective bargaining units.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=671.31s">Yeah,</a> I have the steps listed.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=679.896s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=687.175s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=687.736s">And</a> I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=689.756s">So</a> I would request at this time that we have a meeting of finances as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=696.098s">We</a> don't have a subcommittee group, so I would like to send this to the committee of the whole to discuss finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=701.759s">Now,</a> I know it will have to be televised because we need to, it's public record and it's transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=707.701s">So</a> in lieu of everything, I really think that it's very important that we're very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=714.143s">and</a> very transparent, especially lately, about what we're doing, and so that the whole community can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=720.693s">So</a> I'm requesting that this meeting happen right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=723.256s">This</a> involves people's pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=724.899s">Because</a> if people are being paid $4,000 extra, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=729.145s">What</a> happens if it was a mistake or it was granted when it shouldn't have been? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=733.387s">Do</a> they pay it back? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=734.928s">Do</a> they continue to make it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=737.369s">We</a> have big decisions to make, and this involves people's livelihoods, and I take that extremely seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=742.951s">As</a> do I, as protector of the records and confidentiality.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=761.32s">No,</a> I'm requesting and I'm making a motion for this to be sent to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=766.703s">I</a> need one of my colleagues to second my motion, please.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=780.147s">These</a> are just the questions I looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=782.468s">These</a> could only be a sampling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=784.009s">There's</a> people that do owe money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=786.35s">There's</a> people's longevity that aren't added here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=789.416s">Like</a> there's people, when you figure out their salaries, their longevity is missing from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=793.697s">And</a> I don't know if that's a one-time payment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=798.479s">And</a> again, see, the collective bargaining agreements have documentation that need to be identified.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=806.461s">No,</a> that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=808.582s">I'm</a> saying some people are underpaid, some people are overpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=812.043s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor, Mayor Burke, for us to meet as a committee to discuss finances within the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=818.605s">I</a> think it involves people's pay and it has to be a priority within this committee.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=894.642s">Just</a> a point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=897.003s">If</a> someone's covering for someone else, they get an overtime salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=900.384s">They</a> can't change someone's base salary if they're a union person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=904.126s">And</a> you can bring someone in at a higher step, but you can't change someone once they're working more than one step or whatever's negotiated through bargaining, collective bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=917.131s">You</a> can't do it for one person and not the whole group. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=920.772s">So</a> that's my understanding, and I'm happy to be corrected if that's not correct.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=947.597s">I</a> didn't do any teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=948.978s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=955.981s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=956.221s">But</a> my understanding is that the budget book is presented after the increment step increments have been given.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=969.796s">Okay,</a> but then everybody would have that increase.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=991.04s">Beverly,</a> you're talking more teachers than I'm talking, like, secretarial union.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=999.808s">I've</a> said that three times.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1001.869s">I</a> did not look at teachers, and that's not what I'm questioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1006.774s">That's</a> not what's highlighted, and I would like to keep it focused on what I brought forward and not distract from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1014.397s">And</a> I would like to see if one of my members would please second this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1018.979s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero seconded your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1020.5s">OK,</a> I didn't hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.361s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1021.701s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1560.361s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1562.217s">I</a> just want to thank my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1563.838s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1564.999s">This</a> is really, really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1566.359s">I</a> wanted to start with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1568.901s">I</a> just had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1570.222s">Are</a> all groups now registered with the school department or will be by April 1st, like the friends of and BTOs?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1619.574s">And</a> my follow-up question is about the compliancy policy I read. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1624.677s">So</a> the only, like if someone doesn't register from us, they just can't use the school name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1630.801s">They</a> can be, they'll just no longer be affiliated with us, but they can still run and raise money under a different name, just not like the friends of type thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1643.058s">Okay,</a> I just wanted to be clear on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1645.219s">I</a> really, I like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1646.459s">This</a> is really, really good work to all involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1650.18s">Very.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1650.4s">Thank</a> Jenny and Paul and Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1652.76s">Excellent</a> work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1653.801s">Thank</a> you for bringing it forward in your time on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1657.402s">And</a> I'm happy to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1667.304s">Oh</a> yeah, we did have it on earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1668.664s">It</a> might take a minute to warm up now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1710.776s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=1711.056s">I</a> thought we should have movies.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2133.957s">Are</a> the financials a requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2136.678s">I</a> didn't see the asterisk next to that section. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2138.959s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2139.32s">Is</a> that something that's being part of the policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2142.081s">Maybe,</a> Kathy?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2178.614s">And</a> that brought up a good second question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2180.856s">This</a> is going to the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2183.538s">So</a> do we have someone there that's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2187.204s">making</a> sure that all the groups are registered and that this is followed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2191.466s">It</a> seems like an extra task for someone in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2195.828s">So</a> maybe that's something that we need to think about and bring forward and talk about in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2203.391s">Maybe</a> we can, maybe the superintendent's office will, maybe Deputy Superintendent Nelson can advise us to <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2215.812s">in</a> the future give us a report on who would be in charge of monitoring this information and bringing it forward and like just keeping it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2226.203s">I</a> get it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2248.07s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2248.43s">So</a> I just wanted to be aware to you and maybe you could provide us a report by October 1st, like who's going to be the responsible person.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2258.475s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2259.976s">Okay,</a> so we'll definitely consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2262.578s">I'll</a> put it on my thing to the back of our agenda list as a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2267.361s">So</a> that way there, we remember to make, remind you that it, you know, we'll help each other remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=2275.067s">So</a> we are, I'm requesting a report as to who and how we're going to allocate this additional work to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3131.042s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3131.983s">I</a> just had a point of information about Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3135.564s">Tufts</a> University is holding a community presentation on Wednesday the 21st to inform the community members about programs and resources available to them and provide an overview of recently completed upcoming projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3152.234s">So</a> it's at 6.30 on the 21st at the Alumni Lounge in Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3159.194s">Somerville</a> Line up on the campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3162.116s">And</a> they invited the public to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3164.538s">It's</a> 40 Talbot Ave, 630, Wednesday the 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3169.381s">Tufts</a> is going to go over what they offer the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3172.623s">And</a> what I find very interesting is they're doing Method and Somerville at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3177.186s">So</a> we can see what they're offering Somerville a little bit and what we are getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3182.049s">And</a> so my goal was to go to that meeting and just, I live in Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3188.51s">neighborhood</a> right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3189.671s">I</a> live at the feet of Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3192.414s">So</a> I'm always up on campus, and I'm always interested in how they're giving back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3197.458s">I</a> also am a parent of a Jumbo, and you get a great education there, and they are good to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3205.325s">So</a> they do do some positive things, but we just need to make sure that we're getting what we need from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3214.326s">A</a> couple people spoke on that, so I thought they might be of interest for them to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3218.467s">Thank</a> you for the time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=3540.156s">Motion</a> to approve the request of $2,700 to send Rosalie forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4037.798s">I</a> just wanted to make one comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4041.258s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4042.719s">Krutz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4043.119s">First</a> of all, I think Mr. Tucci's placement over at the McGlen is an excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4052.605s">choice</a> right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4053.766s">I</a> know parents came forward at our last meeting with concerns of spreading Mr. DeLava too thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4059.03s">So</a> I appreciate the administration making a thoughtful and really appropriate choice to send him down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4067.456s">So</a> I wanted to say thank you very much for really thinking about good choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4073.22s">And</a> I appreciate the high school making arrangements and filling in so that way he could step in this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4081.236s">And</a> I know it's a growth potential for Mr. Tucci as well, and a well-deserved one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4086.721s">I've</a> observed him over the years as a committee member, and I've seen him grow in his career. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4091.905s">And</a> I think that he's a great professional from what I've observed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4096.209s">And</a> I'm really happy that he took this step for himself and for the McGlenn community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4103.855s">So</a> I wanted to start by saying thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4107.644s">and</a> if you can convey that to others who I'm sure had a role in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4113.107s">Also,</a> I wanted to say I did attend the open house at the McGlen, and I was extremely excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4119.751s">My</a> children both went through the McGlen, and I saw all the projects, and there was a landscape of people's yards, and one of them had a pool, and that's the one I liked the most because I really want a pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4130.977s">I</a> got outvoted by my family, so we don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4133.838s">I</a> don't think we have enough square footage either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4137.847s">So</a> it was really fun to walk the halls and see the people and see the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4142.311s">And</a> yourself and Dr. Riccadeli did an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4147.635s">And</a> I look forward to seeing tomorrow nights because I'm going to try very hard to be there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4153.359s">Um,</a> I do think that it was pretty full and I would have loved to seen it like filled to the capacity, but it is a big auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4161.525s">So,</a> you know, we'll see what tomorrow night brings and um, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4165.445s">Your</a> presentation maybe could be posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4168.247s">I</a> don't know if anybody recorded it, but it's worthy of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4171.89s">It</a> was very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4172.871s">You</a> went through everything that parents could have for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4176.293s">I</a> liked you bringing someone down who graduated from McGlen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4180.557s">I</a> think it was Sebastian. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4183.979s">I'm</a> sorry, I can't talk tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4185.26s">I'm</a> very tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4186.021s">Sebastian</a> Tringali did a wonderful job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4187.882s">And</a> he spoke beautifully. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4189.343s">And</a> so did the parents of current teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4192.326s">They</a> were very impactful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4194.462s">And</a> the whole flow of the evening was very well done, and you represented our district very well to the parents moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4203.144s">And</a> I think parents left there like, this is a great place to bring my children, so.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4235.595s">So</a> I just had one final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4238.697s">I</a> don't want to ruin all the love fest, but we need to speak about graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4243.259s">And</a> usually Mr. Belson speaks at graduation, but since he's retiring April 30th, <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4249.152s">I'm</a> just asking, would that be you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4251.212s">Nelson?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4254.553s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4255.473s">I</a> didn't know if it... That's why I was just bringing it up for something to think about for future because it was mentioned earlier and just brought it to my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4264.095s">So</a> just something for the committee to put in their mind as a thought and maybe we should speak about it soon because graduation is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4275.277s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4276.117s">Thank</a> you for your time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4624.177s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4624.997s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4625.677s">How</a> many children, uh, uh,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4635.096s">Um,</a> and Mr. Delaver mentioned that the Andrews, um, students received financial <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4646.512s">opportunities</a> to attend if they didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4648.733s">Does</a> the McGlynn have a fund that's big enough to make sure every student with financial need that wants to go can go?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4727.145s">I</a> just want to make sure that every student, no matter of their income or their parent's situation, has an opportunity to not miss out on all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4737.633s">Not</a> only the educational piece, but the social piece as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4741.416s">So</a> that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4742.817s">And</a> I'm very glad that you were able to meet that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4745.839s">If</a> that changes, just <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4748.203s">The</a> mayor already said, you can ask her for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=4750.364s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5568.866s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5569.826s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5571.627s">I'd</a> like to pass it this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5572.987s">A</a> lot of my questions have been asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5575.208s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5862.922s">Do</a> we have any data on? <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5865.043s">Since</a> we started giving all students PSATs, how many more students are taking the SATs because they had that first opportunity?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5890.914s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5891.654s">I</a> think it's a great opportunity because <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5895.398s">that</a> we're offering to all children now to take those PSATs so they're less frightened of taking the SAT and it builds their confidence and they always do better when they have that practice time and I know some other districts have done that for years and I'm very pleased that we're offering that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5918.506s">I</a> think your budget, it looks great and the idea of using your <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5925.775s">What</a> you received last year in a different way is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5929.076s">I</a> do see the increase for the AP studies and any opportunity that our children has to, because we complete globally now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5937.4s">We</a> don't just complete with people from Massachusetts or our neighboring districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5943.522s">Kids</a> that are going up at Tufts, they're from all over the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5946.723s">And</a> if our kids are going to get there, they have to take those higher end classes, and they have to pass some of those exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5953.543s">So</a> I'm more than happy to approve this motion for later. <a href="https://youtu.be/3N-X2ResFqI&t=5961.528s">OK,</a> sorry.<h2><a href="../2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI/2018-03-06_Ybtx6JdbanI.html">Medford School Committee Meeting March 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=552.03s">Just</a> for knowledge and clarification and backup, I am going to request <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=559.204s">I'm</a> actually making a motion to receive an Excel spreadsheet with backup info and totals for each weekly and biweekly employee with their salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=570.513s">I</a> would like it on an Excel spreadsheet in alphabetical order.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=576.799s">I</a> would like it emailed to me within two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=580.182s">And</a> I would also like to add that I would like it presented at every meeting that payrolls are asked to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=588.337s">moving</a> forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=608.308s">Oh,</a> they could send me last week's and then send next week's Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=612.07s">So</a> I'm requesting that for tomorrow, an Excel spreadsheet with <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=617.223s">them</a> listed alphabetically for the current school budget for the second half of the year and for it to be moved on to come with backup instead of just approving payrolls like we do, having them back up like we do with the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=634.273s">I'd</a> like that as well on whenever we meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=638.856s">So</a> I need one of my members to second that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=695.273s">So</a> I'll amend my motion to have the electronic version for now in an Excel file. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=707.019s">And</a> then you can present the backup at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=710.181s">So</a> that gives you plenty of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=712.222s">So</a> as of tomorrow, you can just send me the Excel spreadsheet with the names alphabetically with the current payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=721.463s">who's,</a> what their salary is, all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=724.065s">So</a> I have the backup because I'm approving stuff every week within not one of us sees it just like with the bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=730.05s">Kathy</a> goes and miss secretary.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=741.199s">I'm</a> asking for payroll months, people's payroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=744.662s">I</a> want to see that not bills.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=770.859s">There's</a> a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=772.179s">I</a> need one of my members to second the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=774.4s">And</a> I request a roll call vote at this point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=786.463s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=787.243s">And</a> to be presented at meetings.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=824.079s">That's</a> why I'm just asking for the Excel spreadsheet to be sent to us of employees' payroll, not asking for paper copies, for the current budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=835.94s">And</a> I would like it in alphabetical form. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=838.702s">It's</a> one spreadsheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=840.183s">Any</a> payroll department should be able to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=843.026s">Payroll</a> information is public information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=845.928s">I</a> just want to have the data before we vote on it every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=849.411s">And</a> I want to be transparent throughout the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=853.494s">I</a> think it's important for us to have the data because we just vote on it and we don't ever check it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=860.659s">And</a> I think it needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=862.621s">So</a> that's why I'm requesting <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=864.76s">I</a> just have a question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1645.039s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1646.412s">First</a> of all, I don't think that this should be joined to another committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1649.973s">I'm</a> happy to work on this, but I think that this issue, and I'm not sure we could have already voted on that, and I'm not remembering at this moment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1674.111s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion for this to be a separate committee because curriculum is already a big K through 12 curriculum is a very vast subject area and so is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1686.377s">And</a> I don't want either to get overwhelmed by the other or maybe that's not correct word, but you know, it's been a long week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1694.501s">Um,</a> so I just want to make sure both areas get the attention that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1699.663s">And,</a> um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1702.306s">Parts</a> of what you're asking for does relate to curriculum, but not all of it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1708.169s">So</a> I'm not sure that that's appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1710.951s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion at this point to add a special committee for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1716.674s">And</a> we have a new committee, a new school committee, since January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1723.378s">So</a> I think these members have a right to weigh in on what their opinion is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1728.601s">I'll</a> second it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1774.937s">That</a> takes care of you too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1779.86s">Oh</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1780.621s">I'm</a> sorry.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=1999.592s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2000.293s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2001.074s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2001.734s">Um,</a> I just wanted to say thank you to Anthony and all, all the people in the schools recently keeping our children safe and moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2011.602s">Um,</a> I also would like to know like more about the camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2015.045s">So</a> that way other people in the community know about it, how many kids attended, how's it advertised, what the cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2021.868s">I'd</a> like to see the breakdown of the financials of these camps, so that way maybe we could offer more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2027.193s">So</a> I'm going to ask for a motion to see the financials on these extracurricular programs that we run, so that way we can look at our budget and make more opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2038.424s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2045.989s">No,</a> that wouldn't be.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2083.691s">How</a> many students did you have participate?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2114.495s">I</a> also think that parents working, it's a great thing that we can offer, and that's why I wanted the financers to make sure that we're giving it to as many students as we can, especially if they feel like they can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2128.084s">But</a> if we know what the financials of the program are, we can do some. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2133.972s">help,</a> financial help to families that we might think would benefit from coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2139.356s">Do</a> you know what the cost is for the camp?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2164.799s">Mayor</a> Burke, if I could continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2167.02s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2167.5s">I</a> think the programs are so beneficial to our families and our community, and I appreciate you running these year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2174.617s">Do</a> parents sign up through community schools, or is it handled differently? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2178.278s">And</a> that might be not a question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2180.539s">It</a> might be a question to either deputy superintendent or for Kirsten, our financial person, of how we handle this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2187.841s">Because</a> I want to make sure we give this opportunity to as many students in the community <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2193.237s">or</a> families in the community that we can, even if we have to subsidize in some way.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2222.97s">So</a> to you Mayor Burke, would this be moving under the recreation person or would it stay under community schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2231.176s">Yeah,</a> I'm just curious as to how these things are going to work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2244.863s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion to review these programs and see how, you know, make sure they're in the black and if they are, how we can help benefit families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2254.751s">This</a> program, as well as any like programs similar to this, I don't know exactly the whole list of them, but I want to make sure we open up opportunities to more families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2263.639s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor to have all of these, maybe the whole account for community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2269.263s">I</a> know that's coming before us at the end of the month, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2271.625s">But</a> if they could break down these type of things within it, so we can really give like, you know, a school social worker in adjustment Councilors might know families that could benefit from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2283.934s">And</a> if we know we have the staff already in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2287.761s">that</a> we can work with them and get them in there if we're already paying staff.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2305.07s">Yeah,</a> I mean anything to help anybody else is obviously beneficial to so I'm asking for the the review of the I think it's 362 account the community schools account to be presented to the school committee so we could see these types of Programming that we're offering Mr.. Russo Thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2450.653s">It</a> actually goes through community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2452.414s">If</a> it could be presented with the community schools budget that's coming before us, I think by the end of this month, is what my team are asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2463.591s">I'd</a> be happy with that in a breakdown of the different programs in that fashion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2770.783s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2771.824s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2773.204s">So</a> Diane, when I read your report, a few things stood out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2777.405s">The</a> first one is that because the professional development day has been changed, is there another plan to help these teachers make sure they have the training that they need?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2811.193s">And</a> hopefully they can have a PowerPoint or something that teachers will want to look at, so that way they can implement some of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2824.076s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2824.717s">I</a> just would hate for this not <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2826.593s">because</a> you've worked very hard on it, and they have too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2829.075s">The</a> teachers have done a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2830.476s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2831.516s">The</a> next thing that really stood out to me out of your report was Burlington is fortunate enough to be able to hire several RTI tutors for each building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2841.243s">Having</a> those tutors assures fidelity to interventions, providing more intensive support and core instruction in E-Line and PD around intervention training. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2851.549s">That's</a> true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2852.15s">I</a> think that's key. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2854.345s">I</a> don't know if you feel like a curriculum meeting towards budget time, we might sit down and talk about this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2862.206s">Or</a> you can just make recommendations.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2888.648s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2889.969s">So</a> I just want to make sure we're ready for budget time and that, you know, your recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2894.993s">I</a> know that this was the year that you were going to see how it was working and make recommendations because I know some of us were pushing for our TI teachers for this year, and we said we were piloting this and see how the data brought us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2909.487s">Do</a> you have an idea of which way you're going to be heading? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2912.369s">Because</a> budgets are starting to be presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2914.691s">I</a> just want to make sure that we have a clear vision for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2918.134s">And</a> I'm going to look at you as the expert, seeing what's happened so far.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2940.462s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2940.883s">It's</a> just good to know so that way we're all thinking and preparing for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2945.164s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2945.384s">Coming</a> forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2946.144s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=2946.824s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3345.767s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3347.328s">I</a> added up all the money and it's $225 for this trip per student. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3352.573s">Is</a> that the right amount?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3364.71s">And</a> is there any reduced rate for children on free or reduced lunch, or how do you do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3370.251s">How</a> do you know if a family's just struggling to be able to send their child?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3399.499s">And</a> how would people know that was available to them?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3634.13s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, thank you for bringing the children to this, and good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3638.312s">I</a> hope they will bring back a lot of awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3641.474s">And</a> thank you for making sure that the security measures are implemented and followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3647.577s">Have</a> a fun time, and a motion to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3920.797s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3921.477s">Could</a> we please read the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3926.113s">The</a> incident report policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3927.835s">So</a> just so the community knows moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3931.879s">I</a> know it's a long policy, but I think that the people in our community are watching. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=3937.806s">They</a> would benefit from hearing the policy.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4505.855s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4506.656s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4508.537s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4509.83s">Great</a> to see these increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4511.751s">And</a> as Mr. Belson would have always said, just because we might have a 90% doesn't mean that we're not still committed to the children that haven't passed in four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4523.658s">Sometimes</a> children take longer than four years to complete this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4528.301s">And</a> I remember him saying that many times when we get this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4532.783s">So</a> I don't want anybody in the community to think that we just let kids go if they don't graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4537.906s">We</a> keep working with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4539.601s">until</a> we can't anymore, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4543.932s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4544.312s">It's</a> really good news.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4664.097s">Mr.</a> Benedetto before Mr. Zigney starts, can I, can I make a motion to receive our 17 18 budget in some kind of online format so that way when people are presenting to us, we can review it easily and make notes so that way binder. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4682.697s">Well,</a> I have the binder, and to see this with all the papers coming in, if it was electronically on a spreadsheet that we could see his department and what his budget was and what he's asking for, because throughout these meetings, it's weeks and weeks of these, you lose a paper and you're in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4702.493s">So</a> I'm requesting, I'm making a motion that I'm trying to get us more online and less paper and less binders, and so we can really look at the data at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4712.195s">So</a> I'm making a request for this year's budget, the 17-18, or the second half of it, be presented to us in electronic format, so as we're getting these new papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4724.866s">It's</a> online. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4727.348s">Is</a> it broken down in each? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4728.829s">By</a> department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4730.37s">Not</a> even by department, by subcategories in each department, so that way, like if Mr. Zigny asked for paper, which I know he's not, that paper line is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4741.814s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4743.595s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4744.275s">So</a> I'll look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4745.455s">Um,</a> well there's a motion on the floor to have it sent to us as committee members.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4756.459s">It's</a> a PDF download.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4761.2s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4763.121s">Can</a> we look forward and make steps to make sure that the current, the next year's budget is in some type of electronic full, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4772.71s">so</a> that the committee can receive it and look at it as an active document throughout the school year for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4779.251s">I'm</a> making a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4780.792s">I</a> just think that this is so hard to keep track of all these papers in each department as they come forward, and we can make notes next to them as they're presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4790.353s">It</a> would be really helpful.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4830.462s">I'll</a> bring this up when we talk about at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4833.724s">It's</a> just something to think about moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4836.965s">I</a> really want more electronic documentation and less books in front of us and ways to make, you know, bring us forward so that way we can keep track of things as they're presented throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4850.511s">You</a> know, budget updates as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4852.752s">So</a> we have it all in one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4854.352s">It's</a> just so much easier than trying to go back to meetings and stuff.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4862.314s">My</a> mother-in-law is in the hospital, so I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4864.494s">Oh,</a> that's what I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4865.274s">Yeah,</a> I have to keep my phone on today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4867.094s">I</a> don't know where it's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4868.315s">My</a> mother-in-law is very ill, so I'm getting updates on her. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4871.975s">I've</a> been there all weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4873.195s">Sorry</a> for the inconvenience. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=4874.396s">Mr.</a> Ruggiero.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5623.741s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5624.361s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5625.562s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5628.35s">Through</a> you, could we please send a letter to Mrs. Zang? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5633.232s">Is</a> that her name?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5635.533s">Thanking</a> her for her commitment to the Method High School, or for her students and her time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5641.435s">Justin's</a> mom? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5642.336s">Justin's</a> mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5642.896s">Justin's</a> mom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5643.756s">So</a> I would like a letter sent from the school committee showing our appreciation for her chaperoning our students and taking that time from work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5652.18s">And</a> my second item was to thank Mr. Zigny for coming first. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5658.024s">and</a> putting up with my questions before you got to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5660.825s">Out</a> of the way.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5666.548s">It</a> might. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5666.928s">Who</a> knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5667.448s">Rookie</a> mistake.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5668.649s">It</a> doesn't hurt to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5669.929s">But</a> thank you, Mr. Zigny, for coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5672.91s">And</a> congratulations on presenting your first budget and almost completing your first year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5678.553s">You've</a> got a ways to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5679.973s">And</a> I make a motion to approve this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=5684.835s">I</a> accept the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6073.895s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6074.856s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6075.236s">Um,</a> through you too, uh, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6078.137s">Nelson</a> is, I know the teachers are up for contract renewal and I'm wondering if we could possibly talk to them about working that Friday in exchange for the Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6091.123s">So</a> that way that safe or even a half a day of those that day, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6095.217s">rather</a> than the children not be present for such a long period and still ensure their safety on the date of the preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6105.761s">That's</a> something we can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6107.502s">Be</a> moving forward, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6111.143s">And</a> that's for August, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6358.558s">Beverly,</a> could you provide us the last day of school for this school year? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6363.921s">I</a> saw some people asking that and I just want to put that out to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6369.926s">I</a> know we could possibly have more snow days, hopefully not this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6373.949s">Very</a> soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6377.89s">do</a> that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6378.851s">Some</a> of our teachers are doing snow dances as we speak.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6398.954s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6399.315s">And</a> maybe even on the website or on the blog, an updated calendar be presented because I know some people are already planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6407.849s">some</a> of vacations. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=6408.65s">I</a> think I saw it out there on Facebook or some social media thing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7523.619s">Um,</a> Bob, you might not know this, but, um, do you know how much we in revenue we get from the impact church or any of these programs?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7539.287s">And</a> when I look on their, um, social media sites, they're not just in the auditorium, they're throughout the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7547.45s">At</a> least that's pitches they have posted.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7631.887s">only</a> because we don't have any answers, we don't know where or how things have happened recently, I would just hate for anything further to happen within our community without thought and care. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7649.311s">I'd</a> rather err on the side of being too safe right at this point than opening it up again, especially without time to really consider it and see how <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7660.308s">we</a> can move forward safely and what rules and regulations we need to put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7664.809s">Um,</a> so I second the motion on the floor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7744.121s">Um,</a> so, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7748.733s">Can</a> we shut down these external schools to outside groups and not MedFed, like youth registered groups that are provided? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7764.378s">I</a> feel more comfortable with youth basketball than I do with the outside faction.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7804.515s">With</a> the amendment added, I would withdraw my second. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7808.416s">I'm</a> going to err on the side of safety at this point and say nobody until our committee can meet and make sure that we're safe.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7842.463s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7888.818s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7890.483s">Could</a> we request that one of the detail to make sure that the group stays within the gym and outside facility and not?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7905.108s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7905.408s">And</a> they can use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7906.128s">I'm</a> sure they're going to need to use the restrooms and stuff like that in that area, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7910.45s">By</a> the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7910.95s">By</a> the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7911.47s">So</a> that area will be closed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7913.451s">And</a> people will come in and out one door.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7916.752s">I</a> think there's going to be a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7920.913s">I</a> just want clarification on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7925.515s">I</a> know they raise a lot of money for a good cause as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7928.476s">I</a> just want to make sure our buildings are safe and secure.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7972.274s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7972.814s">Going</a> back to an issue that, um, my committee member brought up about closing the questionnaire. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7984.917s">The</a> survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7985.497s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7986.337s">The</a> survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7986.937s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7987.678s">It's,</a> it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7989.218s">I</a> just had a few questions about that and about what feedback you've gotten in any updates and how that's being used to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=7998.298s">prepare</a> questions for the superintendent's interview. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=8001.22s">I</a> know you did a lot of work on it, so I wanted to give it the justice and a moment to bring forward what you've learned.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=8102.363s">Do</a> you want to use mine? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ybtx6JdbanI&t=8103.343s">Oh,</a> there we go.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=596.683s">Anyone</a> to go with you to talk to the city council, please advise us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=601.445s">I'm</a> sure there's many members that would be happy to attend with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=605.726s">Do</a> you plan on providing it tomorrow night? <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=608.967s">No,</a> we needed to get approval and we have to get on their agenda.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=749.475s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=750.136s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=750.636s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=752.878s">I</a> second the motion to move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=754.619s">But</a> I also am requesting at this time to have an update on all the security as far as doors and locks throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=765.969s">So</a> I know I mentioned it prior, but I am going to ask it, even if it has to be confidential or done in executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=773.054s">I'd</a> like an update of where we are and how we intend to move forward to make sure our children are secure and safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=779.378s">Not</a> that they're not, because I'm sure that they are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=784.122s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=784.582s">How</a> many doors are locked, how they're opened, how many are buzzed in, if all of that equipment is working appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=793.564s">You</a> know, some buildings are harder than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=795.604s">I'd</a> just like an update on where we are with that and make sure that, yeah, building check, security check, like we did for the cameras, just to make sure everything that we have in place is operating well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=808.747s">And</a> what we didn't, we purchased and made sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=811.968s">I</a> want the same thing for all of our doors and buzzers to buzz people in.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1016.899s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1017.159s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1017.999s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1019.619s">I</a> did have some questions, and I know that certain areas within a department's budget are higher, and it all offsets by the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1031.582s">I</a> get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1033.86s">Concerning</a> to me is that I saw a trend in one school being over in a few different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1041.924s">And</a> I didn't know if that was because there was a greater need this year at that school, and we allocated more funding than we anticipated and budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1049.528s">So</a> the question might be more towards the superintendent than it would be to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1054.271s">You</a> may know as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1055.752s">I</a> noticed that on page, sorry, so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1064.066s">On</a> page 3 of 3, the secretaries at the Columbus, they're already at 116%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1068.308s">And</a> then on page 4 of 13, at the top, it says permanent part-time Columbus mentors. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1077.732s">They're</a> well above there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1079.652s">They</a> use 376% of that budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1121.87s">Because</a> I saw it mostly, I can see it five or six times for the Columbus School in different areas, like PE teachers, psychologists. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1134.254s">As</a> you go through it, I saw a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1137.555s">And</a> I just wanted to make sure that there is a reasonable <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1144.637s">answer</a> to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1145.477s">I</a> just didn't understand why just that one school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1157.523s">And</a> that's why the question is to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1160.665s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, were more funds allocated there because there was a need there this year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1182.011s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1182.491s">And</a> my other question was actually a request to see the community schools budget, because we're supposed to see that quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1190.197s">That</a> was voted on a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1191.798s">And</a> we haven't seen it yet this year that I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1194.52s">So</a> there's a request on through you to the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1215.677s">When</a> that report's presented, I'm asking through the mayor to the superintendent, could we also have, I know that a lot of the community is now using the program and everything's going through the computer program so we can find out how many hours we've donated and which schools are being used in which ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1234.399s">If</a> you could just give us a general documentation at that time as well, so we have both reports at the same time, and we can see how much, which buildings are being used throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1244.001s">Like</a> if we have to put extra, you know, surprise the air.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1249.882s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1250.322s">I'd</a> like to see that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1251.903s">I</a> mean, that's interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1252.923s">And</a> as we use it more, that data will become more helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1256.504s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1256.964s">So</a> that's a, I request that it's a motion to have that with the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1262.785s">I</a> need a second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1564.115s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you for all your hard work to get this up and running so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1569.676s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1570.897s">There</a> was definitely a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1572.757s">This</a> program is exactly what we need for that school and to help us with our MCAS scores there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1580.799s">I</a> would like a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1583.64s">afterwards</a> and see the growth from the students as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1588.923s">And</a> I wanted to know if anybody was tracking the last year's fifth grade students to who are now sixth grade students and what program or what we're doing for those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1600.704s">that</a> didn't do so well last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1602.724s">Are</a> we mentoring them? <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1604.605s">What's</a> happening for them as they take the sixth grade MCAS?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1610.546s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure those children also get the needs and the gaps, any gaps that are missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1616.187s">We</a> don't want to just do the next group. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1618.347s">We</a> want to make sure the group that had the issue gets addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1623.428s">So</a> I'm requesting a report on the <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1628.565s">current</a> sixth graders who took fifth grade MCAS at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1633.888s">So</a> there's a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1635.429s">I</a> am hoping one of my colleagues will support. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1638.712s">Report</a> on sixth graders.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1648.738s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1649.599s">And</a> thank you, really, for all that work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1941.736s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1942.617s">I</a> just wanted to make sure that all the students that were eligible were taking advantage of these things, and if there were any gaps, to meet those gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1950.422s">I'm</a> so grateful that you have those interns working on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1954.085s">It</a> seems timely to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1955.986s">And</a> I like your moving forward steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1959.729s">I</a> always love to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1961.451s">This</a> is what we're doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1962.731s">This</a> is what we're going to continue doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1964.353s">This</a> is our next steps to make sure that we're reaching every family and every child that may need this help. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1971.962s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=1973.163s">Great</a> report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2311.997s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2313.017s">Thank</a> you, Maverick. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2314.838s">So</a> there were two things that really stood out to me while we were getting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2319.34s">And</a> it was pretty much from the audience members. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2321.46s">The</a> first was a middle school parent who said that their child came home and told her that another student was vaping in our schools, in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2331.104s">So</a> that was alarming to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2333.685s">And</a> I appreciated her candor in saying that there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2337.815s">The</a> other thing that stood out tremendously is another student that spoke up during the meeting and asked for data to support what we were saying to her because she wasn't just going to believe that we thought it was bad for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2349.943s">She</a> wanted data and backup to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2353.245s">And</a> that's, we have bright children and we need to be prepared with actual facts and figures if we're going to tell them they shouldn't or shouldn't do with something. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2363.391s">So</a> I was impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2365.212s">at</a> that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2366.713s">What</a> I'd like to see, and I talked to you a little bit about this at the end of the evening, is really a hard line, a very hard line that we don't allow cigarette smoking in our schools or anywhere near them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2378.276s">We're</a> not going to allow vaping either. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2380.417s">We're</a> going to have it in our handbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2382.218s">They're</a> going to be at our submaster, I don't know if they're still submaster nights, our welcoming nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2387.599s">Our</a> parents should know our routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2389.52s">It</a> should be initialed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2391.681s">It</a> should be <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2393.142s">For</a> a student that is vaping, we should show everybody, see, we're not doing this in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2399.468s">There</a> are so many health things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2403.151s">So</a> vaping, you think you're just sucking in water. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2405.734s">It's</a> not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2406.194s">It's</a> all chemicals. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2407.075s">And</a> those chemicals are going into our children's lungs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2409.417s">And</a> they think that this is a better choice than smoking, which is even more alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2414.678s">Because</a> we don't know what it's doing in those lungs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2417.0s">Because</a> there could be 40 different chemicals going into your children's lungs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2420.903s">It's</a> huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2421.723s">It's</a> very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2422.904s">And</a> everybody's cool doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2424.806s">And,</a> you know, the way they hide it and the way they can use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2428.208s">And</a> teachers, it can be happening right in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2431.151s">And</a> teachers are supposed to be teaching, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2434.994s">You</a> can't expect this from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2438.036s">So</a> it has to come from the top, the sides, and the bottom up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2441.499s">It</a> has to be a whole community effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2443.453s">to</a> do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2443.913s">I</a> was happy to see Penny from Team Medford, the whole group there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2447.896s">It</a> was a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2449.177s">I</a> wish it had been better attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2451.618s">But</a> if they're not coming to us, then we're going to go every athletic meeting that someone goes to, it should be presented and every coach should be trained on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2461.005s">I</a> just think overall, it's going to be a bigger, bigger picture than we ever anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2466.848s">I</a> want to thank you for bringing this up so quickly and seeing the need for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2472.723s">And</a> your team was excellent at everything, and Tony Vento as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2479.388s">So</a> even our school nurses were present at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2482.911s">This</a> is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2483.791s">This</a> is huge for our children's future health and well-being. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2487.554s">And</a> you were very proactive.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2745.302s">I</a> just wanted to say that the McAdams family were neighbors of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2749.663s">So</a> Mr. McAdams passed two weeks prior to his daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2753.664s">So</a> it's a big loss for our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2755.785s">We've</a> lost four people since Christmas in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2760.467s">And</a> they were a wonderful family in our neighborhood for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2765.788s">And</a> they're always wonderful, wonderful people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2769.649s">And</a> they'll be sorely missed.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2772.842s">In</a> old business, I don't know if we need to go over it, but the field trip form, do we need to approve that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2778.545s">There</a> are two or three minor changes, and I just don't want to miss it if they need to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r7iOMkNcxxo&t=2785.029s">I</a> don't know.<h2><a href="../2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA/2018-02-06_XMHnwGJ5osA.html">Medford School Committee February 5, 2018</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=239.241s">Mr.</a> Benedetto.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=649.926s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=651.607s">So</a> I had gotten some calls about the possibility of the process taking too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=659.371s">Did</a> the teachers and the parents at that meeting feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=664.845s">the</a> process would be quicker now that you've met and made some revisions?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1049.56s">Well,</a> it's part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1051.261s">The</a> part that was concerning to me is, how do you have a list of student attendees when you haven't gotten approval and sent out to the parents, do you want to sign your children up? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1063.052s">So</a> on the day trips, it says, please attach a list of student attendees. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1069.19s">So</a> if all of seventh or eighth grade is going, are teachers able to get a list of every student in that grade level and attach it to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1079.152s">Are</a> they able to do that, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1081.252s">And</a> number two, just because they're invited, that's not the list of who's going until you send home the permission slips to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1088.854s">So</a> that seems premature to me to have that on there in encumbrance on the teachers at that point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1118.184s">So</a> can we clarify that piece so that list of classrooms attending, individual students' names delivered to the nurse one week before, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1128.468s">or</a> grade level or some generalization so they're not thinking that they have to have the exact list.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1135.011s">Yeah,</a> I think that's confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1137.352s">And</a> it's not on the overnight one. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1139.933s">The</a> overnight one does not have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1142.214s">It</a> just says estimated number of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1145.476s">So</a> we could just change that to estimated number of students and then provide the list a week before because it's noted down the bottom to provide a list to the nurse a week before.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1199.132s">Or</a> estimated, even if they know it's estimated and that the final count has to be presented to either the principal, vice principal, or assistant principal, or nurse one week prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1211.56s">So</a> that way they have that time and they'll have the exact names by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1216.633s">and</a> be able to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1217.973s">Because</a> if they're doing, like if the second grade all goes to the, you know, the top school fair, or apple picking in kindergarten, or whatever that they do, that some teacher might not have the list of every student in every other classroom.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1249.546s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1251.107s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1252.547s">And</a> I'd like to see it when it's done.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1256.048s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=1256.228s">Van</a> der Kloot.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3611.037s">Mister</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3612.258s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3613.819s">So</a> thank you for the report, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3616.48s">I</a> wish we had the report that you initially gave us on the 150 so we could see the differences in the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3622.624s">Also,</a> an issue that I brought up, I believe, when we initially got this report, is this just school age children or do we know how many younger children are in those buildings so that way we can plan for future moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3636.633s">So</a> just so we can see what areas are where we are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3665.573s">So</a> the 120 student increase, is that because we went from <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3670.804s">buildings</a> that were 150 down to buildings that included to 100, or is that an increase in the amount of students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3694.314s">Total</a> enrollment, not just from these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3697.465s">Do</a> we have a breakdown of the differences from the January 150? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3701.926s">It's</a> in this report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3767.725s">So</a> for clarification, um, these are the additional ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3772.376s">From</a> the report you gave us in September.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3787.845s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3790.767s">I'll</a> just pull those reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3791.928s">If</a> I have any questions, I'll contact you directly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=3803.511s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4170.933s">Thank</a> you so much for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4173.094s">It's</a> very informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4177.373s">Do</a> we have any numbers, and it may not be you, maybe our headmaster that's in the back of the room, do we know that how many of our high school students that qualify for free and reduced lunch also take advantage of lower application rates for colleges as well as free SATs? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4196.588s">Do</a> we have those numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4197.889s">Because</a> I just want to make sure that those families that are entitled to those benefits know about them and are actually taking part in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4206.735s">Because</a> if they qualify for free or reduced lunch, they also qualify for those programs.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4243.617s">So</a> to the superintendent, could we check those numbers just to make sure that we are getting the word out to those families and those parents of these options, and who's taking advantage of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4256.72s">And</a> if we're not, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4257.83s">then</a> what we need to do better to really let people know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4261.791s">So</a> I'm requesting that report to be added to the reports requested list on the back of our agenda for the superintendent to get back.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4274.734s">I</a> would like the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4276.475s">I'm</a> sure that we know how many of our high school students are getting free SATs and free or reduced college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4286.217s">And</a> I want to compare that to the free and reduced lunch, and to see if there's a gap there, and if there is a gap, what next steps we would take. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=4294.728s">So</a> I need the data first.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5274.278s">So</a> I just want to be clear what next steps are for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5278.161s">Rodriguez</a> who's bringing this forward to the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5284.24s">So</a> she had some further information. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5286.902s">She</a> sent us an email today. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5288.243s">So</a> I'd like to ask her to come to the podium and speak and give us an update of where she is at with moving this forward and also to offer to go to that meeting with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5298.631s">Any</a> funds for the school and getting the beginning of our school playgrounds redone is important to all of us as this committee to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5313.407s">We</a> have up-to-date facilities for our children to play on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5319.753s">I</a> also wanted to ask the mayor if there was any other city funds coming down the pipeline towards this particular item.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5723.653s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5726.273s">So</a> this meeting is next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5729.275s">So</a> I'm just wondering how Cheryl is going to bring forward to the CPA what's necessary without meeting with the superintendent or bringing that data forward to them to continue the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5745.066s">So</a> is there any chance that we can meet this week and go over things so she has something from the school district to present to the CPA?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5757.512s">You</a> will do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5758.293s">You'll</a> sign off?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5760.054s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5760.935s">And</a> so she might need more information and data to present to them in order to qualify for the CPA monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5770.643s">That's</a> where I'm not clear.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5776.948s">And</a> what do you need for Tuesday night?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5825.25s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5827.011s">Roll</a> call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=5828.343s">7</a> in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6068.342s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6070.99s">the</a> committee members so that the community is aware that those choices have been made and who's on the committee and when their first meeting is and explain how the other members of the committee, what their role is so that we're all clear what our role is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6469.18s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6471.181s">Um,</a> next week is, is the 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6474.998s">So</a> that's very short notice for people to make arrangements for child care or whatever to be able to go to these focus groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6484.3s">So</a> is there a timeline for when you're really going to tie this down? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6490.181s">Are</a> you doing a reverse informational call to every parent in the district, like a snow day call? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6498.345s">Is</a> it going to be on our website? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6499.646s">How</a> are we advertising this? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6500.986s">I</a> really want input from the community for this, and I really don't want them to think that we didn't give them sufficient time to be ready for it, especially because the end of that week is school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6514.59s">So</a> I just want to make sure that this doesn't put all of our time on the ground.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6520.071s">OK,</a> great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6529.212s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6583.173s">Did</a> you apply? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6584.293s">Oh,</a> you got to apply.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6588.934s">She</a> might apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6590.675s">Mr.</a> Russo.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6796.795s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6798.756s">Just</a> to be clear, school committee members that are not on the committee should not be attending the focus groups or the applique, because then it would be.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6814.24s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6814.72s">We</a> just wanted to be clear for everyone that we should just stay back and wait for them to present to us the finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6825.272s">And</a> at that point, if we don't like them all, we can ask you to do it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6831.974s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMHnwGJ5osA&t=6833.874s">Ms.</a> <h2><a href="../2018-01-23_HoymGn4EeMU/2018-01-23_HoymGn4EeMU.html">January 22, 2018 Medford School Committee meeting</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=58.343s">to</a> know how the tutoring at the Columbus School is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=61.665s">They're</a> in the meeting minutes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=113.971s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=114.371s">And</a> we are reminding that if we have extra room on the buses, that we're going to fill it up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=132.203s">And</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=133.464s">Maybe</a> afternoon clubs or something, kids that wouldn't be able to access them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=137.327s">Now</a> that there is a bus, if we can fill it with some of those students, it would open up those opportunities <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=144.15s">for</a> people whose parents can't pick them up early?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=175.079s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=177.566s">So</a> I had a question on page 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=179.912s">It</a> says.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=193.391s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=193.711s">Why</a> don't I ask him if it needs each item, if we can resolve them, we can move forward and vote on them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=201.292s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=208.502s">3</a> quarters of the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=209.703s">It</a> says middle 6 pot middle 6 partnerships of or for and it's in the amount of $3376.81 and it says pending classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=223.148s">So</a> I was just wondering what that was for and what classification that would be under. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=229.773s">And</a> you may not know that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=262.687s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=263.307s">So</a> that explains that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=264.928s">It</a> just was cut off, so it didn't say for youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=267.508s">And</a> I appreciate the clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=270.349s">So</a> the next question is on page 15 of 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=274.29s">And</a> it says Commonwealth of Mass in the amount of $3,025.85. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=276.811s">And</a> it says return to grantor for classification. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=285.2s">or</a> account description.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=311.607s">Right,</a> because we want to use every dollar that they give us.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=316.89s">And</a> so my last question is similar to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=320.312s">It's</a> on page 17 of 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=321.592s">And</a> it says the Mass Department of Elementary and Secondary. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=327.035s">And</a> it's a refund grant for $32.50, $59. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=330.597s">I</a> just don't want to give money back once they've given it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=333.939s">Where</a> is this again? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=335.04s">On</a> page 17 of 19. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=336.861s">Up</a> here. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=337.441s">Under</a> Mass Department of Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=339.122s">It's</a> about six or seven down.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=359.966s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=360.767s">Yeah,</a> I just want to make sure they use every dollar that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=365.129s">We'd</a> like to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1223.328s">I</a> remember recently walking the playgrounds and that some of this preliminary work, John <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1230.076s">John</a> might have already done and had ideas for different materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1235.501s">So</a> it's not a new idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1237.703s">It's</a> something that we know that we're in great need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1242.006s">And</a> some of the research might have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1244.528s">But</a> we need to decide what products are best. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1247.931s">But</a> I believe that we should work with Cheryl to move this forward right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1254.056s">This</a> was on my wish list when I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1257.687s">Thank</a> you for taking it and running with it and making it come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1262.269s">So</a> I would like to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1264.99s">And</a> I'm sure Mr. McLaughlin already has some ideas of where to call and what types of materials people are using.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1919.382s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1921.202s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1922.823s">On</a> this subject, first of all, I think this is great in any way that we can highlight the work that our children and our community does. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1929.326s">I</a> think it's marvelous, especially not only through this, but in general, I think we need to publicize more and more about the great opportunities that children of Method have and the great learning experiences they <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1942.485s">they</a> show our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=1945.026s">Based</a> on that, I also wanted to ask you about the new commissioner for DESC, and they finalized the last, down to three.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2019.452s">So</a> in addition to that, any idea of what direction any of these new commissioners are going to go?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2034.285s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2035.365s">I</a> just want to keep a close eye on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2037.427s">And</a> I know that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2039.889s">It's</a> just when a new commissioner comes in, new regulations, new mandates, different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2046.213s">And</a> not only do you have to advocate for that, but our next superintendent also has to have the wherewithal to do that as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2054.993s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2055.934s">Is</a> there a motion to accept the report and place on file?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2842.783s">So</a> going back to the blizzard bags, this year, actually, throughout Western Mass, there are a few school districts that are piloting blizzard bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2852.865s">And</a> with today's technology, there is a lot of online learning happening, especially for, I believe, our high school students who have AP exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2862.347s">And</a> they take that exam no matter how many blizzard days or how many snow days we take. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2867.228s">They</a> have to have so much curriculum covered by that date. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2870.029s">And</a> that's the date everybody <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2871.629s">in</a> the nation takes that test. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2873.531s">So</a> by losing days for snow, we are behind kids like in Georgia and California that aren't losing that learning time and who actually might start school in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2885.16s">They're</a> at an advantage of some of these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2889.303s">So</a> I believe the future in education is more electronic learning, more interactive learning, and I believe our teachers are savvy enough to teach those <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2901.028s">in</a> that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2902.209s">I</a> know that we don't have a per child device at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2907.211s">And</a> I know that our district would love to move forward with that, but that's a very expensive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2912.613s">But</a> if other school districts are doing this in learning, and we can see how they're using it effectively, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2921.197s">for</a> all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2922.138s">In</a> Western Mass, there are children that are in all different socioeconomic things and they don't all have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2928.361s">We</a> can learn from them and maybe, I brought this up a year or two ago, actually, when we did have a bad winter about two years ago when we were going late, late into June and almost into July. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2941.687s">It</a> might have been three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2945.639s">I</a> think it is coming towards method, and we have to have an open mind with this and start looking at it and seeing what options are out there and planning for our future rather than wait and see what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2958.524s">So</a> I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2959.864s">I</a> think that we should look forward to this, if not for this year and the next year's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2965.567s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=2966.874s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3611.288s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3613.049s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3614.61s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3615.67s">I</a> think it's a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3620.352s">So</a> in the title of it, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO and PTG. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3627.045s">I</a> would like to have friends of as well listed, not as under other, but directly PTO, PTG and friends of groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3639.777s">Because</a> I just want them to realize that they are included in part of this and the oversight will also include them. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3650.126s">And</a> I would like to add a number nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3653.287s">Register</a> any event that uses our building through community schools so we can track how much our schools are being used and which schools are being used the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3662.211s">So</a> that way we can allocate funding for maintenance and repairs and custodial services and extra paper towels and toilet paper to those buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3673.195s">And</a> extra cleaning if that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3676.436s">And</a> to track where in the city we're using a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3680.712s">And</a> maybe we need to move it to another side of town so other people in the community can go that don't drive or have an opportunity to attend different things, especially if it's a big event. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3695.535s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3696.335s">So</a> those are the type of things I'd like to see added. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=3698.756s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4668.675s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4670.396s">Mr.</a> Benedetto on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4671.938s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4672.358s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4673.599s">So</a> on our agenda on the back page, there's a listing of reports that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4679.524s">And</a> if you look under requested reports, the first one was a report on PTOs, including how they're helping the community and what they are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4687.39s">And</a> that was requested last April, April of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4691.642s">Now,</a> it needs to be amended because when we spoke at our committee meeting recently, the superintendent said that he is planning to have all the PTOs come before the school committee between the month of April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4705.066s">So</a> I would like that amended, that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4710.988s">And</a> the goal that I had when I requested that last April was to bring the PTOs forward to <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4719.039s">celebrate</a> the things that they have done for the school district, and to bring them forward so the rest of the community knows, like, hey, at the McGlynn, this is some of the things they've run, and they've run it for 10 years, and the kids still love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4731.401s">Or,</a> you know, second graders get to go to the science museum, and the PTOs throughout the district have paid for the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4740.583s">Let's</a> celebrate some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4742.083s">And</a> that was my goal back in April, because I just felt like, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4745.8s">less,</a> people have less time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4748.762s">And</a> they're so involved with trying to get by and things are a little harder for families now or they're busier. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4754.907s">And</a> it was just a way to bring them in to celebrate the work and the time and the effort they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4762.053s">My</a> history has been started as a PTO <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4767.893s">president,</a> co-president with Ian Ricucci, who is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4771.262s">And</a> I had a big mouth then, and I wasn't ready to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4774.632s">So</a> that's why I ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4776.853s">and</a> I'm here in front of you now, and didn't run till my youngest graduated, because I felt like I had a big voice as a parent, and you all have a big voice, everybody has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4786.218s">Show</a> up at these meetings, say what you need to say, ask us for what you need and what your children need, that's what we're here for, and we need to celebrate the people who have volunteered, have done so much already, and before we ask them to do more, we need to show them that we do care and we are here to help support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4805.727s">I</a> just want to applaud the people here tonight and encourage more people in the community to come forward and ask the superintendent to amend that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4814.113s">So</a> that way, we do have the PTOs come in April and May of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4820.118s">And</a> we should invite the press so that they get a list of all the wonderful things that have been happening, not only this year, but years past as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4828.804s">I</a> think it's time to celebrate some of the happenings in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4832.687s">So</a> that's my request, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=4834.749s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6426.304s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6427.184s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6428.124s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6429.585s">On</a> this, I reviewed it, and I didn't see a sign off from the school nurse, so it says the email is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6436.628s">And</a> the email that it's attached only says, please provide me with a list of students so that way I can let you know if there's any medical. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6447.592s">There</a> was no official write off.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6466.655s">So</a> this is my point with the new paperwork that we just required everybody to fill out is you need a list of students going before you send it out for permission slips. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6477.963s">So</a> you don't have the list until it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6481.65s">So</a> it's like a catch-22?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6488.117s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6488.438s">But</a> the way that the form does, it asks for the list of students when they're filling out the form, so that way they can get the approval from the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6496.327s">And</a> I think other schools are having this issue as well, that I've been told about. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6502.245s">So</a> like you can't, the nurse can't tell you how many children or if any children have any medical issues that my nurse may be necessary or medications may be necessary or delegation of medications may be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6514.775s">So</a> we might need to re look at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6517.838s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6519.079s">So</a> we need to, we need to change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6521.201s">And</a> I'd like you to look at that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6523.643s">I</a> know we've talked about it on the phone this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6526.345s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6527.226s">Superintendent</a> Belson and so like if you if this I'm noticing this problem here So we need to get our initial approvals going and then provide a list and then the nurse thing which is difficult because then you get a estimate what the cost of the trip is with or without a nurse so We want to make it we want to make it
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6571.159s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6571.879s">I</a> agree with that, but just make sure that all policy, everybody approving this, <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6578.121s">and</a> all teachers filling this out know that, like it says here that you have to have a nurse's signature, and if someone's trying to fill this out correctly, the teacher is gonna say, I can't get the signature or curriculum director's signature, and it only says one is, what if it's, you know, it's getting tricky for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6599.255s">I'm</a> getting phone calls about it, so it's getting tricky for people.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6615.923s">But</a> this is a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6617.264s">I</a> want, if there's a change necessary because we just approved this, then we need to make those edits and make it easier for our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6624.609s">I'm</a> not trying to make it harder.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6653.721s">In</a> addition to that I would like a motion to send this to the Rules Committee to review this paperwork and make it more streamlined for all of our teachers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6757.91s">Mayor</a> Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6759.031s">Motion</a> for... Before we close, can I just remind the superintendent there are a couple items under requested reports that were due in January 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6768.135s">So</a> the update report on enrollments in January 2018, including prospective number of students and new developments with units of 100... <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6779.587s">That</a> was requested September 18th, and it was due in January 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6784.529s">Can</a> you update us with the prospective date? <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6790.211s">Okay,</a> and my last one is an update of next steps for RTI requested for February 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6798.173s">This</a> is just a reminder, it's not February 1st yet, but I will be expecting that report soon.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6812.23s">I'm</a> not sure if it's leap year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6832.551s">And</a> I look forward to the report on the enrollments including the prospective number of students in new developments at our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/HoymGn4EeMU&t=6841.098s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-12-19_TZU2d7XxyA0/2017-12-19_TZU2d7XxyA0.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 18, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=666.15s">Ann</a> Marie? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=667.251s">Do</a> you have a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=670.793s">I</a> just wonder if the superintendent or the chief financial officer could, it says it's still the generalization, like Medford High School miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=684.494s">Is</a> there any way that we can get more information when those items are placed on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=689.237s">It's</a> the first item on page one of six.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=926.606s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=928.547s">Just</a> on that topic, I was wondering if the mayor could at some point possibly give us <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=936.744s">a</a> list of criteria for school committee members to be on the committee and how she's going to make that decision?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=949.652s">And</a> then moving forward from that, only two members will be allowed to be on?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1279.117s">There's</a> a number of things to be worked out in the interim, but this is the basic plan and hopefully that addresses your issue Thank you, thank you for handling this so quickly mr. Belson in such a proactive way that's what we hope to be and <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1300.437s">as</a> a committee find out that there is an issue and be very proactive about handling it so that way it doesn't continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1307.203s">So</a> thank you for handling it so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1309.885s">I</a> just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1311.046s">Based</a> on this math, $150 a day for a bus for a total of $4,800 divided by 16 weeks, that's two days a week for a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1321.974s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1324.837s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1325.924s">Also,</a> so since we have a bus at that school and leaving, can the kids in the extracurricular programs take the bus as well home? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1335.189s">So</a> that way, more kids that can have access to after school activities, since we're already paying $150 per bus, given that if there's enough room, can we look at opening that up, please?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1367.017s">And</a> what is the criteria for the students that would be picked for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1370.199s">Is</a> it their grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1371.42s">Is</a> it their MCAT scores? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1373.582s">Is</a> it a combination of both? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1376.264s">What</a> is the criteria for a student to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1378.185s">Would</a> it be parent request?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1396.942s">Or</a> there might be a parent that wants their child to participate, even though it may look like they're doing well in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1402.983s">But</a> what they see at home, the struggle at homework, is not always the same as it is in the classroom, as I remember it as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1412.565s">So</a> I would like the parents to have some say and input, or at least be able to request it for their child as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1454.362s">So</a> at this time, I'd like to motion to approve this program and get that going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1458.544s">And</a> I would like a follow-up report the first meeting back in January, since time is of the essence, because MCAS are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1468.188s">They</a> don't slow down for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1469.688s">So</a> we want to make sure we get the word out to parents as quickly as we can that this program is going to be taking place, and that they can have some input as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1478.793s">Thank</a> you so much again, and there's a motion on the floor to have this approved and to have an update.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1508.644s">And</a> even if you only have partial update, just either by email or at our next meeting, we want to be kept abreast of this issue.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1517.847s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1518.247s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=1518.387s">Van</a> de Kloop?

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2656.522s">I</a> just wanted some more logistics about the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2660.186s">Now,</a> I know that Mr. Skorkis, you've retired from the school district, and you're still involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2669.915s">Is</a> it your intent to stay with it for the next three years?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2674.559s">And</a> then does it <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2678.212s">Does</a> this project and this grant free up any teaching time for Mr. Skorka so he can focus on this or is this after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2686.45s">How</a> does that whole thing work?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2703.893s">Now,</a> does he get paid for his time in addition to his salary for this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2708.496s">Is</a> that part of the grant funding?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2710.798s">Is</a> there a stipend for him? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2711.958s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2712.399s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2713.7s">And</a> yourself as part of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2717.022s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2717.756s">OK,</a> I just want to make sure that we're not burning out some of our finest and best within the district by having them wear too many hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2728.06s">And</a> I didn't know if it was something that the school district was partially funding by helping him with that, or if that's a dream in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2738.104s">Maybe</a> the superintendent can enlighten me a little bit more of the logistics of all of this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2836.202s">So</a> my point was, based on the social, emotional needs of so many students that I see, both at the district I work at and our district, and this book of wonderful things that have been done, I just didn't know if <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2853.965s">We</a> had plans on expanding this program so that way it's like more full-time position for someone from the Method Public Schools to manage because this is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2864.074s">This</a> is a lot of wonderful things and I would just hate for it to go away, to go away.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2942.366s">So</a> just as we increase the number of school adjustment Councilors and Councilors and, you know, different behavior lists throughout buildings, this is a positive way to bring that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2953.731s">And</a> I think that as a committee, we should really look at positive ways to influence and to enable our children to become leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2961.274s">But</a> in order to have that, we need to have people <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2964.063s">like</a> Mr. Trotter and like Mr. Skorka to lead the way and have these programs and to really invest in this in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2974.846s">That's</a> my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=2976.687s">I</a> just want to make sure that we don't burn out people by trying to do everything, and we just want things to be done well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3246.578s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3247.619s">So</a> I see one of the projects is called benches for dagger and I don't know if you are we have realized this but our. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3253.881s">My,</a> this is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3256.623s">He</a> builds beautiful benches and tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3266.429s">So,</a> you know, you may want to invite him up when there's building involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3271.513s">And</a> I know he recently retired from his job as state auditor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3275.455s">So</a> he does have the time to come and volunteer and help.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3287.804s">Not</a> that I volunteered them, but you know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3291.007s">I'll</a> throw anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3293.289s">But</a> also, yes, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3296.351s">So</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3297.132s">I</a> was going to say throw you under the bus, but this week I don't want to say that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3302.977s">Also,</a> what I'd like to say is I would like to see some more PR about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3308.502s">And</a> I know that the transcript is always at our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3312.246s">And</a> I'm wondering if we could highlight one of these groups on a weekly thing with the transcript and see where they are now in the planning stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3321.034s">And</a> then every once in a while, pop a different group every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3324.877s">Or</a> some way, since they're here and you're here, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3329.728s">I'm</a> hoping that we can push for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3332.23s">Thank</a> you for the moment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3357.595s">So</a> that is great, but a lot of our citizens, especially linking the seniors, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=3363.961s">Cugno</a> suggested earlier, we need it in print.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5042.119s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5043.1s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5045.08s">Through</a> you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5046.94s">So</a> thank you so much for addressing concerns on the security cameras and making sure that all upgrades will be done by mid-January in every single <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5057.883s">I</a> appreciate that as a committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5062.724s">I</a> just want to talk a little bit about locking of the doors, especially at our high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5068.106s">I</a> know we made some changes and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5070.206s">Could</a> you just go over what that is or provide us with an update on that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5090.611s">And</a> could you look at how the weekends are handled at different buildings and like with people using our facilities and how they're locked after. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5098.835s">So</a> I'm requesting, I'm actually requesting motion, I'm making a motion, sorry, brain freeze, um, to have that report presented to us by mid January. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5110.141s">Um,</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5116.556s">I</a> think that's great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5123.261s">I</a> think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5124.482s">So</a> I'll make that motion that we have a meeting, a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5129.406s">Committee</a> of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5130.367s">Committee</a> of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5131.248s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5132.603s">on</a> security and doors locked and to school for different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5137.226s">I</a> think it's so imperative in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5139.907s">And</a> thank you for all the work that you've done to make sure that we're moving forward in this direction.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5672.346s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5673.507s">I</a> have similar concerns to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5678.745s">This</a> day and age, some families really struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5681.306s">And</a> paying for school breakfast or lunch is not easy for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5686.748s">Not</a> all who don't qualify for free and reduced have the funds available either. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5695.132s">They</a> just might make a little too much money, but not enough for the whole month. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5699.354s">And</a> I just feel like children know that children didn't get the same lunch as them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5708.6s">If</a> they're given the cheese sandwich, it is a signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5711.541s">I</a> know we're providing food, and I appreciate that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5717.523s">It's</a> just a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5719.824s">I'd</a> like to see the number increase at the bare minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5723.345s">I</a> would like to see no number there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5726.106s">And</a> just remind us of the parent, because I hate holding children accountable for things that are out of their control. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5733.669s">Sometimes</a> it's not the child, it's the parent's situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5737.625s">that</a> causes the lack of payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5740.366s">And</a> having a school lunch person say to you when you're in the line and your friend's next to you, I'm sorry, you've already charged two over. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5749.448s">And</a> someone hears it, it's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5753.55s">It's</a> just an issue for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5755.13s">So</a> I'm not really on board with it as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5759.111s">And</a> again, I wanted to go back to the report I requested on December 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5765.778s">with</a> how many free and reduced lunch applications we received by building, by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5774.106s">Are</a> we getting the word out to everybody initially in September? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5779.351s">I</a> know it's a great undertaking, so I was just still hoping to get that report before we make changes to what we're already doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5788.303s">So</a> I don't I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=5790.104s">I'm</a> still on the fence.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6387.635s">Is</a> there a cost difference between the cheese sandwich meal and the other meal that the school system is paying more for one than the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6396.738s">Yes,</a> there is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6418.306s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6418.866s">My</a> second question is, can we pass this without changing the food we offer to the children, without substituting the meal? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6430.667s">contacting</a> parents after three missed days, reaching out to do all the outsourcing, contacting them to get payment without saying, now you have this separate mail.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6472.631s">So</a> I'm making a motion at this point that you go back and you look at the guidelines to see if we can accept this without changing the actual lunch that the students get. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6485.701s">And</a> if so, great, and if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6489.474s">how</a> much leeway we have in the number of meals that we need to, a minimum number that, or the largest number we can put down.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6534.932s">So</a> the motion's on the floor right now for her to check the wording to see if we can do this and move forward without changing the lunches for any of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6545.819s">I</a> need a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6546.64s">I</a> second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6555.545s">To</a> see if we can meet the federal requirements without changing the mail options for our students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6887.903s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6888.924s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6889.824s">Dr.</a> Perla, thank you for coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6891.704s">Can</a> you just describe what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6893.345s">Because</a> we're talking about an incident most people watching at home have no idea what happened, how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=6900.307s">And</a> just to clarify for ourselves as well as everybody watching.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7006.195s">So</a> I have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7007.877s">I've</a> been bringing up throughout this school year some concerns of overcrowding of this bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7014.422s">And</a> I've been assured that it's not overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7017.825s">And</a> I've been assured that it's been monitored repeatedly throughout there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7022.429s">Is</a> there someone assigned to stand at this bus stop from this point forward?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7066.97s">So</a> another concern I have is, you know, high school kids are big kids, and they take up a lot of space on a bus, and you add the size of their backpacks, which is like another person, really, another small person, trying to fit on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7080.676s">And</a> maybe that's why a lot of students are trying to, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7084.412s">push</a> on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7085.153s">It</a> is colder now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7086.954s">Maybe</a> some of the athletic teams are done and there might be more students taking this bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7092.558s">I</a> would love to see it closely monitored and maybe another update in a month as to how that's going and to follow up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7101.584s">We</a> don't want our students hurt.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7121.973s">Thank</a> you for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7123.034s">Thank</a> you for taking care of the manor so quickly and effectively and making sure our student was treated well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7129.08s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7130.161s">You're</a> very welcome.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7591.301s">First</a> and only. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=7592.142s">I</a> just want to say.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8749.285s">So</a> I had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8752.847s">Are</a> we tracking how many students are, how many incidents are occurring both on school, in school and on the school grounds, so we have data?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8762.673s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8764.114s">Have</a> we gotten any flyers, like just we were talking about at a last meeting about bullets, about putting them up through the school, like when vape equals a whole pack of cigarettes? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8777.832s">We</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8779.314s">Kids</a> don't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8780.555s">They</a> think that this is better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8782.397s">When</a> my daughter is getting her nurse practitioner and everybody comes in and said, oh, I quit smoking. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8789.504s">I'm</a> just so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8790.385s">I'm</a> only vaping now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8792.047s">And</a> she's like, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8794.029s">That</a> is not something to be happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8795.871s">It's</a> actually worse for you in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8799.134s">Even</a> without the data, they know that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8822.559s">And</a> we talked about using the Voc Graphics Department to make those posters. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8828.503s">The</a> sooner the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8829.844s">Let's</a> get that education started. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8831.846s">Let's</a> just let them talk about like, hey, did you see that poster in the hallway? <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8836.03s">And</a> then keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8840.135s">I</a> would hate to have a kid do it one more day than necessary.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8845.4s">Thank</a> you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8847.162s">And</a> maybe by the end of the school year, you can follow up with some data and what things have worked and what <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=8853.897s">which</a> areas we need to improve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9229.539s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9229.799s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9231.08s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9231.52s">I</a> have to find my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9233.4s">Oh,</a> here they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9237.321s">Farewell</a> to my school committee members and <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9240.253s">friends,</a> Robert Emmons Carey and Anne-Marie Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9243.174s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you both for your service and your commitment to the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9250.796s">They</a> are why we are here, and you've always put what's in their best interest first. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9256.717s">Anne-Marie,</a> you've worked hard from the first moment you decided to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9263.099s">I</a> think I might have been there then.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9269.279s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9270.1s">You</a> have done many things that have benefited this city, this great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9275.101s">A</a> few I want to mention are how you helped develop the summer camp program. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9281.223s">You</a> represented Method very well at the state level and you made sure our little theater was remodeled so that our students have a professional place to perform and to receive their many awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9294.18s">You've</a> worked tirelessly to attain what is best for the students and the employees of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9301.385s">Thank</a> you for all your years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9304.588s">Bob,</a> your quiet mannerism and knowledge and history of Medford have always amazed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9314.375s">Your</a> passion to make sure our Medford students have civics in the curriculum has benefited all of Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9322.195s">You</a> have always looked out for me on this committee to make sure I follow the rules and ask the questions in a manner that I get the answers I need and to not get myself in too much trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9337.061s">You</a> also know who everyone is and what their job is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9343.124s">That</a> also has been tremendously helpful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9347.025s">I</a> will be calling to ask you many questions, and I'm sure you'll be sending me message <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9351.851s">of</a> what I did wrong and how do I ask it right the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9356.235s">So</a> I am so happy to have had the opportunity to serve with such devoted members for the last six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9364.001s">In</a> closing, I just want to say how much I will miss you making faces at me across the chambers or beside me when I go on about an issue or I ask oh so many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9379.641s">And</a> I might miss when you piggyback one of my comments, which happened again tonight, to make sure that the superintendent understands what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9390.89s">I'm</a> grateful to both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TZU2d7XxyA0&t=9395.113s">I'm</a> grateful to both of you for the things I have learned while working with you and wish you great things as you move forward, onward.<h2><a href="../2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY/2017-12-18_rpuG18WtRwY.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Dec. 18, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=661.782s">I</a> just wonder if the superintendent or the chief financial officer could <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=668.547s">It</a> says it's still the generalization, like Medford High School miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=675.652s">Is</a> there any way that we can get more information when those items are placed on here? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=680.235s">It's</a> the first item on page one of six. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=682.077s">Those</a> are the student activity accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=683.918s">So</a> those are always going to be there?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=919.527s">Just</a> on that topic, I was wondering if the mayor could at some point possibly give us a list of criteria for school committee members to be on the committee and how she's going to make that decision.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1283.269s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1284.709s">Thank</a> you for handling this so quickly, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1286.99s">DeBelson,</a> in such a proactive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1289.871s">That's</a> what we hope to be as a committee, find out that there is an issue and be very proactive about handling it so that way it doesn't continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1298.195s">So</a> thank you for handling it so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1300.516s">I</a> just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1302.016s">Based</a> on this map. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1305.017s">$150</a> a day for a bus for a total of $4,800 divided by 16 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1310.078s">That's</a> two days a week for a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1312.939s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1315.819s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1316.92s">Also,</a> so since we have a bus at that school and leaving, can the kids in the extracurricular programs take the bus as well home? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1326.162s">So</a> that way more kids <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1328.022s">that</a> can have access to after school activities, since we're already paying $150 per bus, given that if there's enough room, can we look at opening that up, please?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1358.025s">And</a> what is the criteria for the students that would be picked for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1361.206s">Is</a> it their grades? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1362.406s">Is</a> it their MCAT scores? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1364.566s">Is</a> it a combination of both? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1367.267s">What</a> is the criteria for a student to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1369.167s">Could</a> it be parent requests?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1387.95s">Or</a> there might be a parent that wants their child to participate even though it may look like they're doing well in school, but what they see at home, the struggle at homework is not always the same as it is in the classroom, as I remember it as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1403.576s">So,</a> you know, I would like the parents to have some say and input or at least be able to request it for their child as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1445.353s">So</a> at this time, I'd like to motion to approve this program and get that going. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1449.536s">And</a> I would like a follow-up report the first meeting back in January, since time is of the essence, because MCAS are coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1459.203s">They</a> don't slow down for anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1460.704s">So</a> we want to make sure we get the word out to parents as quickly as we can that this program is going to be taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1467.028s">and</a> that they can have some input as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1469.79s">Thank</a> you so much again and there's a motion on the floor to have this approved and to have an update.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1499.667s">And</a> even if you only have partial update, just either by email or at our next meeting, we want to be kept abreast of this issue.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1509.47s">Van</a> de Kloop?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1937.002s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1937.783s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1937.923s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1938.603s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=1939.584s">For</a> you to the superintendent, could we please send a letter of thank you?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2646.124s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2647.545s">I</a> just wanted some more logistics about the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2651.209s">Now,</a> I know that Mr. Skorkis, you've retired from the school district, and you're still involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2660.938s">Is</a> it your intent to stay with it for the next three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2665.575s">And</a> then does this project and this grant free up any teaching time for Mr. Skorka so he can focus on this or is this after school? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2677.469s">How</a> does that whole thing work?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2694.904s">Now,</a> does he get paid for his time in addition to his salary for this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2699.508s">Is</a> that part of the grant funding?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2701.83s">Is</a> there a stipend for him? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2702.971s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2703.431s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2704.692s">And</a> your son is part of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2708.015s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2708.798s">OK,</a> I just want to make sure that we're not burning out some of our finest and best within the district by having them wear too many hats. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2719.087s">And</a> I didn't know if it was something that the school district was partially funding by helping him with that, or if that's a dream in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2729.137s">Maybe</a> the superintendent can enlighten me a little bit more of the logistics of all of this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2827.216s">So</a> my point was, based on the social, emotional needs of so many students that I see, both at the district I work at and our district, and this book of wonderful things that have been done, I just didn't know <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2844.387s">if</a> we had plans on expanding this program so that way it's like more full-time position for someone from the Method Public Schools to manage because this is a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2855.096s">This</a> is a lot of wonderful things and I would just hate for it to go away. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2858.499s">To</a> go away.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2933.404s">So</a> just as we increase the number of school adjustment Councilors and Councilors and, you know, different behavior lists throughout buildings, this is a positive way to bring that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2944.746s">And</a> I think that as a committee, we should really look at positive ways to influence and to enable our children to become leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2952.308s">But</a> in order to have that, we need to have people <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2955.088s">like</a> Mr. Trotter and like Mr. Skorka to lead the way and have these programs and to really invest in this in our committee and I mean in our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2965.872s">That's</a> my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=2967.733s">I</a> just want to make sure that you know we don't burn out people by trying to do everything and we just want things to be done well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3237.017s">Go</a> ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3237.578s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3238.619s">So</a> I see one of the projects is called Benches for Duggar. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3241.582s">And</a> I don't know if you realize this, but my, this is scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3248.129s">She's</a> a new job. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3249.41s">He</a> builds beautiful benches and tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3257.479s">So,</a> you know, you may want to write him up when there's building involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3262.565s">And</a> I know he recently retired from his job as state auditor, so he does have the time to come and volunteer and help.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3279.577s">Not</a> that I volunteered them, but you know me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3282.058s">I'll</a> throw anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3284.339s">But</a> also, yes, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3287.379s">So</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3288.0s">I</a> was going to say throw you under the bus, but this week I don't want to say that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3294.021s">Also,</a> what I'd like to say is I would like to see some more PR about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3299.546s">And</a> I know that the transcript is always at our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3303.29s">And</a> I'm wondering if we could highlight one of these groups on a weekly thing with the transcript and see where they are now in the planning stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3312.078s">And</a> then every once in a while, pop a different group every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3315.921s">Or</a> some way, since they're here and you're here, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3320.773s">I'm</a> hoping that we can push for that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3323.275s">Thank</a> you for the moment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3348.628s">So</a> that is great, but a lot of us citizens, especially linking the seniors, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=3355.018s">Cugno</a> suggested earlier, we need to imprint.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5033.192s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5033.933s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5036.136s">Through</a> you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5037.998s">So</a> thank you so much for addressing concerns on the security cameras and making sure that all upgrades will be done by mid-January in every single area. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5049.132s">I</a> appreciate that as a committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5053.773s">I</a> just want to talk a little bit about locking of the doors, especially at our high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5059.158s">I</a> know we made some changes and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5061.22s">Could</a> you just go over what that is or provide us with an update on that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5081.679s">And</a> could you look at how the weekends are handled at different buildings and with people using our facilities and how they're locked after? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5089.885s">So</a> I'm requesting, actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5093.067s">requesting</a> motion, I'm making a motion, sorry, brain freeze, to have that report presented to us by mid-January.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5107.61s">I</a> think that's great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5114.312s">I</a> think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5116.112s">So</a> I make that motion that we have a meeting, a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5120.113s">Committee</a> of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5121.314s">Committee</a> of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5122.114s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5123.294s">on</a> security and doors locked and to school for different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5128.281s">I</a> think it's so imperative in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5130.964s">And</a> thank you for all the work that you've done to make sure that we're moving forward in this direction.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5663.413s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5664.574s">I</a> have similar concerns to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5668.937s">You</a> know, this day and age some families really struggle and paying for school breakfast or lunch is not easy for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5676.843s">Not</a> all who <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5680.787s">don't</a> qualify for free and reduced have the funds available either. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5686.213s">They</a> just might make a little too much money, but not enough for the whole month. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5690.437s">And</a> I just feel like children know that children didn't get the same lunch as them. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5699.673s">If</a> they're given the cheese sandwich, it is a signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5702.635s">I</a> know we're providing food, and I appreciate that we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5708.598s">It's</a> just a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5710.299s">I'd</a> like to see the number increase at the bare minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5714.422s">I</a> would like to see no number there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5717.163s">And</a> just remind us of the parent, because I hate holding children accountable for things that are out of their control. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5724.748s">Sometimes</a> it's not the child, it's the parent's situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5728.69s">that</a> causes the lack of payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5731.453s">And</a> having a school lunch person say to you when you're in the line and your friend's next to you, I'm sorry, you've already charged two over. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5740.54s">And</a> someone hears it, it's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5744.624s">It's</a> just an issue for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5746.225s">So</a> I'm not really on board with it as it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5750.189s">And</a> again, I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5753.13s">to</a> go back to the report I requested on December 4th with how many free and reduced lunch applications we received by building, by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5765.196s">Are</a> we getting the word out to everybody initially in September? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5770.418s">I</a> know it's a great undertaking, so I was just still hoping to get that report before we make changes to what we're already doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5779.364s">So</a> I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=5781.165s">I'm</a> still on the fence.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6378.578s">Is</a> there a cost difference between the cheese sandwich meal and the other meal that the school system is like paying more for one than the other? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6387.671s">Yes,</a> there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6389.373s">Is</a> it significant?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6409.841s">My</a> second question is, can we pass this without changing the food we offer to the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6419.22s">without</a> substituting the meal, contacting parents after three missed days, reaching out to do all the outsourcing, contacting them to get payment without saying, now you have this separate meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6434.366s">Can</a> we do it that way?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6463.567s">So</a> I'm making a motion at this point that you go back and you look at the guidelines to see if we can accept this without changing the actual lunch that the students get. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6476.653s">And</a> if so, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6478.253s">And</a> if not, how much leeway we have in the number of meals that we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6485.376s">to</a> a minimum number or the largest number we can put down.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6525.883s">So</a> the motion's on the floor right now for her to check the wording to see if we can do this and move forward without changing the lunches for any of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6536.786s">I</a> need a second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6546.516s">To</a> see if we can meet the federal requirements without changing the mail options for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6556.026s">And</a> second by Mrs. Bandicoot.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6878.22s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6878.921s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6879.882s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6880.803s">Dr.</a> Perla, thank you for coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6882.666s">Can</a> you just describe what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6884.308s">Because</a> we're talking about an incident most people watching at home have no idea what happened, how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6891.277s">And</a> just to clarify for ourselves as well as everybody watching.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6997.147s">So</a> I have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=6998.828s">I've</a> been bringing up throughout this school year some concerns of overcrowding of this bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7005.372s">And</a> I've been assured that it's not overcrowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7008.774s">And</a> I've been assured that it's been monitored repeatedly throughout there. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7013.377s">Is</a> there someone assigned to stand at this bus stop from this point forward?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7057.922s">So</a> another concern I have is high school kids are big kids, and they take up a lot of space on a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7063.664s">And</a> you add the size of their backpacks, which is like another person, really, another small person, trying to fit on the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7071.606s">And</a> maybe that's why a lot of students are trying to push on. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7075.988s">It</a> is colder now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7077.888s">Maybe</a> some of the athletic teams are done, and there might be more students taking this bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7083.511s">I</a> would love to see it closely monitored, and maybe another update in a month as to how that's going, and to follow up with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7092.514s">We</a> don't want our students hurt.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7112.944s">Thank</a> you for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7113.944s">Thank</a> you for taking care of the manor so quickly and effectively, and making sure our student was treated well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7121.208s">I</a> appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=7122.575s">OK,</a> Ms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8740.27s">So</a> I had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8743.851s">Are</a> we tracking how many students, how many incidents are occurring both in school and on the school grounds so we have data? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8753.193s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8755.114s">Have</a> we gotten any flyers like just we were talking about at a last meeting about bullets? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8759.935s">about</a> and putting them up through the school like when they equals you know a whole pack of cigarettes like people don't know that kids don't know that they think that this is better when my doctor I mean my daughter is <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8777.064s">getting</a> her nurse practitioner, and everybody comes in and said, oh, I quit smoking. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8780.487s">I'm</a> just so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8781.368s">I'm</a> only vaping now. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8783.029s">And</a> she's like, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8785.01s">That</a> is not something to be happy about. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8786.852s">It's</a> actually worse for you in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8790.094s">Even</a> without the data, they know that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8813.565s">And</a> we talked about using the Vocal Graphics Department to make those posters. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8819.489s">The</a> sooner the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8820.833s">Let's</a> get that education started. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8822.835s">Let's</a> just let them talk about, hey, did you see that poster in the hallway? <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8827.018s">And</a> then keep moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8831.122s">I</a> would hate to have a kid do it one more day than necessary.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8836.386s">Thank</a> you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8838.148s">And</a> maybe by the end of the school year, you can follow up with some data and what things have worked and what <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=8844.892s">which</a> areas we need to improve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9214.684s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9220.747s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9220.808s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9222.088s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9222.548s">I</a> have to find my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9224.39s">Oh,</a> here they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9228.297s">Farewell</a> to my school committee members and friends, Robert M. and Skerry and Ann Marie Cugno. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9234.162s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you both for your service and your commitment to the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9241.787s">They</a> are why we are here, and you've always put what's in their best interest first. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9248.252s">Ann</a> Marie, you've worked hard from the first moment you decided to run for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9254.117s">I</a> think I might have been there then.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9261.091s">You</a> have done many things that have benefited this city, this great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9266.116s">A</a> few I want to mention are how you helped develop the summer camp program, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9272.201s">You</a> represented Medford very well on the state level, and you made sure our little theater was remodeled so that our students have a professional place to perform and to receive their many awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9285.163s">You've</a> worked tirelessly to attain what is best for the students and the employees of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9292.364s">Thank</a> you for all your years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9295.585s">Bob,</a> your quiet mannerism and knowledge in history <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9301.448s">of</a> MedFit have always amazed me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9305.349s">Your</a> passion to make sure our MedFit students have civics in the curriculum has benefited all of MedFit students. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9313.172s">You</a> have always looked out for me on this committee to make sure I follow the rules and ask the questions in a manner that I get the answers I need and to not get myself in too much trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9328.057s">You</a> also know who everyone is <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9331.952s">in</a> what their job is, that also has been tremendously helpful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9337.996s">I</a> will be calling to ask you many questions, and I'm sure you'll be sending me message of what I did wrong and how to ask it right the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9347.223s">So</a> I am so happy to have had the opportunity to serve with such devoted members for the last six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9354.989s">In</a> closing, I just want to say how much I will miss you, making faces, <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9360.307s">at</a> me, across the chambers, or beside me, when I go on about an issue, or I ask oh so many questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9370.632s">And</a> I might miss when you piggyback one of my comments, which happened again tonight, to make sure that the superintendent understands what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9380.116s">I'm</a> grateful to both of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/rpuG18WtRwY&t=9386.095s">I'm</a> grateful to both of you for the things I have learned while working with you and wish you great things as you move forward, onward.<h2><a href="../2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw/2017-12-05_XE9EudnPjZw.html">Medford School Committee meeting December 4, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1435.172s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1436.253s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1437.353s">Could</a> you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building, do you know that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1444.119s">Yeah,</a> whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1452.345s">Does</a> every student sign have a form returned?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1457.649s">And</a> how do we get two parents that <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1462.423s">don't</a> know what this is, and it's coming home, and they're not knowing to turn them back in, and get the quote we need, because that would, you know, that would change a lot, and do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams, as well as college applications, if they reduce lunch, has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1486.256s">And</a> I don't think, like up at the high school you might not get any kids learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1501.926s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1503.227s">So</a> that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost 100% return rate per building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1514.455s">So</a> that way we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1523.542s">So</a> I would really like to know how many forms were returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1527.846s">per</a> school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1536.553s">They</a> either sign off yes or they sign off no. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1540.176s">I</a> know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community, because I don't think people especially, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1548.088s">Yes,</a> I'd like to comment on that that we have engaged and made sure that we have the free and reduced applications in multiple languages they are returned and
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1614.703s">And</a> my point too is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1620.826s">They</a> get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1630.029s">And</a> it's so important to feed our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1632.29s">And</a> it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1638.452s">I'm</a> not applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1640.513s">you</a> know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper and like it's so many, many more aspects of this as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1655.047s">So</a> that's just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1657.129s">I</a> think I made it maybe last year as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1854.464s">Before</a> our nutritionist leaves, I saw on some social media that the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk and some of the things and asked that they just look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=1867.256s">I</a> saw on some social media about, at the McGlen and definitely at the Columbus, I saw some posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2728.195s">I</a> heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB port, and they also can even exhale right into their hoodies and you don't even see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=2740.581s">So</a> kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4387.762s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4388.562s">Through</a> you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4391.544s">Do</a> we have a vaping policy on the books, or are we using the tobacco policy?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4406.055s">Well,</a> with the growth I see throughout, not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4413.738s">high</a> school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that, so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology, so students are very clear how we as adults feel in this community about this, because students just do not believe, they think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now, and that's what you hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4438.757s">and</a> they don't realize when it gets in their lungs it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications and there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having two people in my house who read this report before I got here, 27 and, almost 27 and almost 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4457.924s">One's</a> a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4464.786s">They</a> were happy to see our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4467.507s">that</a> we're doing a great job in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4470.13s">We</a> want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one, so that way the wording is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4479.022s">Because</a> once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4482.386s">It's</a> not as cool, not as fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4484.789s">So</a> that's a motion on the floor and I need a second from one of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4489.933s">I'd</a> like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not gonna continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4505.387s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4505.707s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4752.946s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4754.547s">So</a> when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add back-end training?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4761.912s">It's</a> already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4763.833s">And</a> is that for both the high school and the vocational schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4766.555s">It</a> is seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4768.016s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4769.057s">I</a> think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=4770.678s">Mr.</a> Ternagli?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6147.985s">Can</a> I ask a point of clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6150.506s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6152.686s">So</a> you said the key point cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6155.147s">Does</a> that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key points?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6196.993s">Do</a> we have a completion hopeful date?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6203.398s">And</a> then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6264.7s">Just</a> as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6278.952s">He</a> has in the past, and he has more to donate, so I'm making a motion now that the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now, and if it's appropriate to have them as backup.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6344.554s">I</a> also make a motion to send him a thank you note. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6347.676s">I</a> think we did once, but I'll send it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6349.297s">Consistently</a> over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his hands.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6360.425s">Oh,</a> I thought you already asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6361.806s">No,</a> I was just on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6362.766s">So</a> that was the security issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6364.928s">I</a> wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed, what types of movement happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6371.932s">Were</a> there any positions added? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6373.894s">I'm</a> just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6375.174s">I</a> know we talked about a HR person at one point, the superintendent mentioned something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6379.197s">I</a> just was wondering what that looks like now. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6381.759s">Or</a> maybe we could even get like, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6383.94s">you</a> know, a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6385.822s">Yeah,</a> thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6421.418s">Can</a> we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6429.502s">Yeah,</a> that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go through the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6437.485s">Names</a> and job titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6438.546s">Yeah,</a> that would be great, thank you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6464.194s">I</a> just also want to speak about the community schools budget, and I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly, so just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6479.01s">We</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6479.991s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6480.872s">Maybe</a> we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget, because I might forget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6490.76s">Is</a> there a motion on the floor to accept this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6493.642s">Motion</a> to accept the report, place it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6496.584s">All</a> those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.285s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.425s">All</a> those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6497.925s">Motion</a> granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=6498.466s">Thank</a> You Christine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7779.523s">Mr.</a> Benedetto.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7782.004s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7783.484s">First</a> of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7790.203s">I'm</a> just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7800.729s">The</a> policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7814.316s">I</a> think it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7815.217s">I</a> think it's fair and appropriate.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7854.226s">does</a> meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7860.689s">The</a> only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7870.352s">make</a> sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7882.598s">So</a> I would like to see and approve that form. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7885.9s">And</a> also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7894.424s">So</a> it's here all in one shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7896.525s">So</a> if parents ever want to see what's the policy, they have the sample forms, they have everything right here, part of this packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=7904.009s">So</a> I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those in tact, because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8023.085s">Forms.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8028.275s">At</a> least we have a policy in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8030.998s">The</a> forms need to be approved, I want them district wide, there's specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on, without having everything at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8041.03s">I</a> do like, everything is in here that we need in here, but I, <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8047.661s">How</a> long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8051.322s">I</a> mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8053.263s">I</a> mean, they have to be K-12 forms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8176.392s">So</a> the form I'm looking at is is the application to go on the field trip Not so much all the forms that all parents have to do but even the application form like okay I want to take my second grade class to Apple picking at you know <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8195.231s">And</a> so I'm going to go online, I'm going to fill this out, it's going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8208.975s">That's</a> the type of form I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8210.257s">From</a> the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8211.218s">From</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8212.019s">And</a> I want it tracked, so I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8218.086s">This</a> grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8223.992s">And</a> maybe as a district, we might want to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8227.977s">you</a> know, I want that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8229.619s">So</a> that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point, but I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing, and this is how you apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8239.251s">I</a> want it to go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/XE9EudnPjZw&t=8240.893s">If</a> you just do that one.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1444.104s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1445.185s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1446.246s">Could</a> you tell me what the percentage of the forms returned are for each building? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1450.609s">Do</a> you know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1451.269s">So</a> the free and reduced eligibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1453.011s">Yeah,</a> whether they sign that they need it or they return the form saying that they're not eligible but they have to sign their form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1460.516s">Does</a> every student sign have a form returned? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1464.839s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1465.6s">And</a> how do we get, like, two parents that <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1471.348s">don't</a> know what this is and it's coming home and they're not knowing to turn them back in and get the quote we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1478.61s">Because</a> that would change a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1481.631s">And</a> do parents know that this also reflects in whether or not they pay for SAT exams as well as college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1489.593s">Their</a> free and reduced lunch has bigger implications other than just foods on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1495.175s">And</a> I don't think, like up at the high school, you might not get any kids with learning forms, but if they knew that that was tied in and there was like a campaign to really educate people throughout the community, I think that our numbers could actually be higher than what they're listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1511.182s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1512.142s">So</a> that that's concerning to me and I think we have to have like almost a hundred percent return rate for building and like really make it like a campaign or part of re-registration at each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1523.366s">So</a> that way we we are making sure we capture hungry families as well as giving all those alternative <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1531.547s">processes,</a> so I would really like to know how many forms were returned per school, like broken down by school, as well as a plan for outreach for next year, so that way we are reaching every family. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1545.497s">They</a> either sign off yes or they sign off no. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1549.1s">I</a> know it's a big job and a big undertaking, but I think it's well worth it in the community because I don't think people <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1555.35s">especially</a> non-English families. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1558.534s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1559.856s">Knowing</a> that there are other things that this qualifies them for is so important to make sure they get food.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1624.147s">And</a> my point, too, is sometimes there's awards for 100% return rate for classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1629.75s">They</a> get really getting the word out and being a campaign so that the word goes home and people are excited and learning about it because they don't pay attention to every form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1638.974s">And</a> it's so important to feed our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1641.235s">And</a> it's so important for kids that say, oh, we don't have money for our college applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1647.378s">I'm</a> not applying. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1649.431s">you</a> know, the tests are covered and the applications are cheaper, and like, it's so many, many more aspects of this, as well as our district could receive more federal funding because of our percentage rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1664.952s">That's</a> just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1666.232s">I</a> think I made it maybe last year as well.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1865.257s">Um,</a> I, I saw on, um, some social media that, um, the Columbus School was talking about maybe sour milk at some of the things and asked that, that, that they just look into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1876.16s">I</a> saw on some social media about it at the McGlen and, and definitely at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=1880.921s">I</a> saw some, uh, posts about children not taking the milk because they felt the milk was sour.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2737.137s">I</a> heard that students are doing it in classrooms because it looks like just a USB. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2743.525s">And</a> they also can even exhale right into their hoodies, and you don't even see anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=2749.552s">So</a> kids in class are actually, they call it dueling.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4415.023s">Well,</a> with the growth I see throughout not just our community, but socially, in adults as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4422.726s">high</a> school age students, I would like for this committee to start working on that so that way it's in our handbooks as vaping, as juuling, as the correct terminology so students are very clear how we as adults feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4437.623s">in</a> this community about this, because students just do not believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4442.767s">They</a> think that, oh, I quit smoking, I'm only vaping now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4446.09s">And</a> that's what you hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4447.731s">And</a> they don't realize when it gets in their lungs, it's like popcorn and it blows up their lungs and it does all these health implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4454.417s">And</a> there's not a lot of data because they haven't been doing it for years, but having <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4460.256s">Two</a> people at my house who read this report before I got here, almost 27 and almost 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4466.063s">One's</a> a future NP and one works in another community on these exact programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4473.751s">They</a> were happy to see our numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4476.474s">that</a> we're doing a great job in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4479.097s">We</a> want to be clear, call it what it is, name it, say it's not okay, and tell them that from day one so that way the wording is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4488.045s">Because</a> once you name something, it's not like this secret thing anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4493.77s">So</a> that's a motion on the floor, and I need a second from one of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4498.892s">I'd</a> like to see this in place and in every handbook at our junior high and high school level by next year so that parents know that this is happening in our community and that we're taking it seriously and we're not going to continue.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4761.918s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4763.52s">So</a> when you're doing that training this year for CPI or First Aid, can we add a back-end training? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.005s">It's</a> already in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4770.886s">It's</a> already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4772.787s">And</a> is that for both the high school and the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4775.509s">Yes,</a> it is seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4777.011s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4778.031s">I</a> think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=4779.553s">And</a> I think that's wonderful.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6156.949s">Can</a> I ask a point of clarification? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6159.491s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6161.673s">So</a> you said the key point cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6164.076s">Does</a> that mean all cameras are now online and working or just key point?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6209.313s">Two</a> weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6210.294s">And</a> then all cameras within the district will be up and running and functioning appropriately?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6273.704s">Just</a> as another follow-up, I know that Attorney Bill O'Keefe offered to supply us with extra cameras, and even if we have them as a stash of backup cameras, he's more than willing to donate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6287.951s">He</a> has in the past, and he has more to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6290.292s">So</a> I'm making a motion now. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6293.754s">that</a> the superintendent reach out to him and just see if they're functioning with our system now and if it's appropriate to have them as backup cameras.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.042s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6353.542s">I</a> also make a motion to send him a thank you note.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6358.425s">Consistently</a> over the years providing us with any technology that comes to his gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6365.632s">So</a> that was the security issue I was I wanted some clarity on the business office team and now that it's fully staffed What types of movement will happen were there any positions added like I'm just curious I know we talked about HR person at one point the superintendent mentioned something like that I just was wondering what what that looks like now, or maybe we could even get like you know a workshop plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6394.812s">Yeah,</a> thank you
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6430.247s">Can</a> we see that chart anyway, just so the committee members, we have an idea of what the roles are, who's in those roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6439.012s">Yeah,</a> that would be helpful, because if we have any questions moving forward, of course we'd go to the superintendent, but you know, it's just to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6446.496s">Names</a> and job titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6447.657s">Yeah,</a> that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6449.198s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6473.201s">I</a> just also want to speak about the community schools budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6479.202s">And</a> I know that the committee approved almost two years ago about having it quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6484.564s">So</a> just as a friendly reminder that I'd like to see that coming forward soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.024s">We</a> will. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6488.985s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6489.865s">Maybe</a> we can even add it to the list of items on the back of our agenda so we don't forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6495.066s">Because</a> I might forget if it's not written. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6497.286s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6502.13s">You</a> never know, it could happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=6504.372s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7790.968s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7792.489s">First</a> of all, thank you for making all the changes I brought forward at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7799.219s">I'm</a> just hoping that that statement about the method of public schools is committed to ensuring that the district field trips are accessible to all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7809.745s">The</a> policy adheres to all requirements set forth by both Section 504, Rehabilitation Act and American Disability Act meets the needs that were brought up by other people at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7823.313s">I</a> think it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7824.074s">I</a> think it's very appropriate.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7859.864s">And</a> I just wanted to comment that I hope that that does meet that need, and thank you for adding that in, as well as making the changes I brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7869.706s">The</a> only other thing I have is I was hoping to see an example of the form that teachers and staff would meet, and I wanted to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7879.37s">make</a> sure that it's on the online, so it goes from one person, gets signed off by the nurses, then goes to the administration, and then finally signed off by the superintendent in electronic format. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7891.639s">So</a> I would like to see and approve that form. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7894.922s">And</a> also an example of the medication administration slash delegation form that the district uses, I'd like to see that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7903.469s">So</a> it's here all in one shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7905.571s">So</a> if parents ever want to see what's the policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7908.613s">They</a> have the sample forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7910.155s">They</a> have everything right here part of this packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7913.018s">So</a> I'm asking that this be revised and brought to us with those intact because that was what was requested at our last meeting for my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=7922.708s">Can</a> I ask a question?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8037.256s">At</a> least we have a policy in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.477s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8039.717s">The</a> forms need to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8041.399s">I</a> want them district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8042.8s">There's</a> specific things, so it's hard to approve something based on without having everything at one point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8050.045s">I</a> do like everything is in here that we need in here, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8056.688s">How</a> long would it take to get the forms to us and be presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8060.23s">I</a> mean, we have a lot of meetings coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8062.291s">I</a> mean, they have to be K-12 forms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8182.382s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, follow up on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8183.863s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8185.424s">So</a> the form I'm looking at is the application to go on the field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8190.508s">Not</a> so much all the forms that all parents have to do, but even the application form, like, OK, I want to take my second grade class to apple picking at, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8204.147s">small</a> like farms. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8206.109s">And</a> so I'm going to go online. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8207.891s">I'm</a> going to fill this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8209.572s">It's</a> going to go to the nurse and it's going to go to my head, you know, my principal and the superintendent for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8217.99s">That's</a> the type of form I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8219.29s">From</a> the teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8220.271s">From</a> everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8221.031s">And</a> I want it tracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8222.111s">So</a> I want to know, I want data next year saying, this is where they went. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8227.112s">This</a> grade over here went on five field trips, whereas this school over here hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8232.994s">And</a> maybe as a district, we might want to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8236.695s">Or</a> I want that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8238.656s">So</a> that's the form that I, I don't need every single form at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8243.117s">But</a> I want, when you roll this out, hey, here's our new thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8246.398s">And</a> this is how you apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8248.258s">I</a> wanted to go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8249.899s">It's</a> the form that starts the process.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/eOruUd5h8M4&t=8313.441s">This</a> is just for teachers to fill out an application to take the class.<h2><a href="../2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s/2017-11-21_zONRLFs-p1s.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 20, 2017</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4505.44s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4506.94s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4509.862s">So</a> Roy, I've learned a tremendous amount from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4513.484s">And</a> I've watched blue and white run through your veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4520.188s">Because</a> I know you'll never bleed red. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4522.952s">It</a> will always be blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4524.455s">You</a> are a Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4526.198s">You'll</a> always be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4528.201s">Even</a> when you retire, I know if I call you, you're answering that cell phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4534.074s">And</a> that's because you're one of the most dedicated men I have ever met in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4539.999s">And</a> your service has been phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4543.621s">And</a> I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4544.582s">And</a> I'm so glad that you're leaving at a high in your career and leaving us in such great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4550.887s">You</a> worked very, very hard to put us where we are now and help us through the hard days. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4558.192s">And</a> I wish you well finding a hobby. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4561.975s">And</a> not driving Maxine crazy And good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4566.279s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4566.559s">Appreciate</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/zONRLFs-p1s&t=4567.32s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-18_GPyVAF2hz_Q/2017-10-18_GPyVAF2hz_Q.html">Medford School Committee meeting October 16, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=79.164s">That's</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=83.106s">OK,</a> so there's a few things that I noticed on the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=90.85s">On</a> the second page, I had made a motion last week to have <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=98.037s">internal</a> rankings and notifications made on the transcript, and that if they couldn't be made, then we needed to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=110.282s">So</a> I was just wondering if the superintendent, we didn't call the meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=117.965s">OK,</a> so it should have said by last week, by the end of last week, in the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=124.307s">The</a> emergency meeting was supposed to happen by the end of last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=127.545s">So</a> that's the first change.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=154.968s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=156.918s">So</a> in the next section, it says, Mrs. Kreatz said that the robotics engineering team are presently traditional classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=168.566s">And</a> in 2019, it's scheduled to go on a cooperative plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=172.229s">I</a> think she made a motion to have that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=176.152s">And</a> I just wanted, I can ask you later about an update on it, but I just wanted to comment on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=268.863s">My</a> other two are exactly about the minutes themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=273.706s">On</a> the next thing, community participation, there also was a motion made to have the teachers, the administration, and the school committee meet to update the action plan to make sure all voices were on that action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=289.077s">That</a> motion isn't in the notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=293.153s">And</a> that motion was made at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=295.895s">And</a> we can discuss it after, but as far as just the minutes, that's what you want, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=305.602s">And</a> then there's one more issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=307.784s">It</a> says on the motion of Mrs. Cugno, second by Mrs. Stone, that the meeting was adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=313.028s">Mrs.</a> Cugno wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=315.673s">So</a> that couldn't have been her. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=317.714s">That</a> was the only other correction on the minutes themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=321.136s">And</a> if the superintendent wanted to comment on anything, that's fine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=347.084s">I</a> just had a quick question on page 9 of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=349.426s">It</a> says MMH Clearinghouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=352.828s">And</a> it's over $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=355.01s">And</a> it says youth opiate prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=359.193s">And</a> I just had never seen that on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=362.173s">on</a> our bills before, and I was just wondering what that was.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=368.836s">Christine?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=369.417s">And</a> what types of things does that cover? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=371.057s">Curriculum.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=371.958s">Oh,</a> it's the curriculum? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=372.938s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=373.438s">And</a> that's taught through the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=377.52s">What</a> age group is getting the curriculum? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=381.863s">The</a> opioid grant.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=385.864s">OK,</a> and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=387.365s">I</a> just hadn't seen it on the bills, and I'd just like to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=391.419s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=392.6s">That's</a> my only question on bills.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1412.069s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1412.99s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1414.411s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1414.991s">It</a> just really speaks to the approach of how we handle students in MedFit, the whole child, because it's not just about getting them through and getting them either off to college or military or to a job, but to really seek what they are looking for in their needs and trying to meet those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1434.679s">So</a> I really think that having job experience, even if it's not paid, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1441.868s">position,</a> it gives you so many life skills that a lot of our young people are lacking, and that employers and colleges are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1450.373s">They're</a> looking for students that are prepared, that are on time, that show up when they're supposed to, or call if they're sick, or can't answer the phone in a professional manner, and all of those skills that you might not get in a day at school, but need to move forward and need to present yourself <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1471.652s">not</a> only yourself, your family, but also your community in Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1476.477s">So</a> when you move on, people are like, oh, look at that kid from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1480.602s">And</a> that's a skill that all children need, not only financial skills, but just professionalism and all of those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1489.934s">I</a> think it's great that we have this position now at Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1492.815s">I</a> know we struggled for a few years with amount of guidance people per student ratio, and we've increased them in the last six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1502.478s">I</a> know the superintendent's commitment to that department has been great, and I'm glad that we're taking a whole child approach at Medford High, as well as, you know, I'm very proud of the work you've done, that it's been acknowledged, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1517.527s">And</a> I'm very happy to bring in any dollars you want to bring that benefit our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1523.732s">And</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1525.353s">And</a> you deserve all the recognition that comes along with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1530.817s">So</a> maybe a note in someone's employee file would be warranted at this time, Mr. Superintendent, that the committee is impressed and appreciates the hard work of both <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1544.865s">Mrs.</a> Jenkins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1546.326s">Did</a> I say it right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1548.487s">It's</a> usually Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1549.167s">Westmock</a> to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1551.308s">Thank</a> you very much, Mr. Kline and Ms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1905.317s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1906.057s">I</a> actually have a question for the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1909.698s">First</a> of all, thank you for going and representing Medford so well, and thank you for presenting this evening in such a professional manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1916.921s">I'm</a> very impressed by both your presentations and glad you're Medford students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1922.702s">My</a> question to you is, since you've gone there, what different things have you done on your social media? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1930.837s">since</a> you've gone there? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1932.098s">How</a> have you taken what you learned and it changed your everyday life?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1946.049s">And</a> you've changed how you speak and what you post?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1972.092s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1972.953s">And</a> even your contract with your friends and your schoolmates, has it changed how you speak and what you might say? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=1979.598s">Does</a> it make you rethink before you hit post?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2009.643s">So</a> I have a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2010.924s">Since</a> this seemed to have touched you both, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2014.254s">Not</a> only would the Andrews kids benefit from your presentation, the McGlen Middle School would as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2021.4s">And</a> since they don't have representatives going, I'm going to request that you maybe get a chance to present to the sixth graders at the McGlen as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2031.108s">And</a> I'm going to ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2032.469s">Caldwell</a> and your principal if they could make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2036.172s">So</a> I want to squirt you over and do that presentation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2039.315s">And</a> I would really love to see students from both schools attend next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2044.247s">so</a> that we have representatives talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2046.608s">Because</a> this is what we hear is a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2049.548s">Bullying,</a> cyber bullying, cyber issues, they happen at night, but then they come into the school every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2059.191s">And</a> the school's in a very tricky situation on how to handle things that happen outside of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2064.993s">And</a> we have to set policies and procedures, which we're still working at because things change so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2072.755s">So</a> if we have <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2074.612s">students</a> like you, strong professional students talking to other students, they might hear you, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2082.595s">And</a> so I think that your work that you've done and what you've learned is very valuable and I'd love you to share it to the other building as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2090.177s">That's</a> my first motion on the floor to make sure that these children get the chance to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2096.059s">So</a> I'll need a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2098.419s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2099.34s">And</a> then, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2100.607s">to</a> make sure that both schools have the opportunity to attend this next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2104.691s">And</a> we do more of that collaboratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2108.415s">That's</a> my next motion, is to make sure both schools get a chance to partake in this next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2115.743s">So</a> very good.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2840.115s">So</a> I was just wondering, are we the only Massachusetts school attending this conference?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2860.764s">And</a> is it typical for a superintendent to go as well as a teacher?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2868.247s">I'm</a> just checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2868.967s">I'm</a> just asking.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2879.492s">I</a> think my colleague has a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2881.673s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=2881.893s">Quinn,</a> must don't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3240.04s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3240.44s">Mr.</a> Benedetto follow up you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3242.222s">Um,</a> so I'm very glad that you're going, Mr. Superintendent, um, for a few reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3247.386s">Number</a> one, I've seen you represent us very well and very, um, official capacities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3253.552s">And</a> I know you represent as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3255.554s">And</a> I know that you will take every opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3258.569s">to</a> talk to Mr. Bloomberg and bring him and his money back to Medford where he started and where his money belongs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=3265.454s">And</a> so make sure you, you know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4049.003s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4050.384s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4051.845s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4052.365s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4054.948s">I</a> just had a question about the RTI fundamentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4057.75s">I</a> know we were considering <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4059.604s">adding</a> additional help last year at budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4062.965s">So</a> I just want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4064.625s">At</a> that time, we identified additional staff members that may be helping with RTI. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4070.047s">Will</a> they be helping with this training? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4072.567s">I</a> don't know exactly what staff members, off the top of my head, we identified as helping out with RTI. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4080.949s">But</a> I just want to make sure that if we are providing any training and insight, <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4084.817s">to</a> make that program better that all staff members are invited, not just the regular ed teachers?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4123.475s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4124.256s">And</a> it says here, help us consider our next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4128.398s">Would</a> you provide us with a report of what, you know, those steps are? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4133.191s">Because</a> we want to keep track of this this year in case it becomes a budget issue for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4138.173s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4138.953s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4139.433s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4157.359s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4160.488s">I</a> just really want to make sure, because teachers spoke about how important RTI is in making those changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4166.49s">So</a> before budget times and if we're going to allocate additional funding, I want some data and updates throughout this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4176.253s">So</a> maybe in January, we can have an update of how it's going and what it's looking like. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4181.695s">So</a> by March, when the superintendent's thinking <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4185.898s">Where</a> I'm allocating funds for next year, if we do see any concerns, he can keep it on his radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4191.18s">Because</a> I'm keeping it on mine, Mr. Belson.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4206.785s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4215.934s">There</a> was a request that you had made for a report at our last meeting that I didn't notice on our... And there's one on there that should come up too. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4224.676s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4225.436s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4226.477s">So</a> I just didn't know if this was an appropriate time to make a comment for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4230.318s">Is</a> that okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4231.078s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4231.618s">You</a> had asked for a breakdown of the male-female concussion report at our last meeting, and I didn't see that report on the list of requested reports.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4245.625s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4246.245s">And</a> also just to keep in mind that we asked that non-athletic concussions be followed if we're notified at that same meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4255.369s">So</a> just as a reminder that that data is important for all students, not just our athletic students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=4264.292s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5292.792s">Actually,</a> it was before you started talking about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5296.435s">I</a> just realized that there was another report on the reports requested list missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5302.559s">But</a> I'll wait until after the superintendent talks about the.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5515.558s">an</a> update on the number of students taking the bus from North Method to the high school and back in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5521.902s">I</a> did send an email to the headmaster of our high school, and he said that they have been monitoring it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5531.007s">And</a> I think that some days there's less than, there's a few open seats on the bus leaving from the high school going back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5538.852s">But</a> there's some days that overcrowding is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5541.793s">I</a> would like some more significant data. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5544.294s">I</a> just want to make sure that all our students have a ride home. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5547.114s">I</a> know there's over 100 students taking the bus on any given day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5552.576s">So</a> I want data, and I'm requesting that for the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5557.657s">I</a> can read the email that I received. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5560.458s">That's</a> OK.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5606.531s">I</a> would, just because it's different from what I had gotten from an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5611.814s">And</a> also, I would like to know how many passes are given out for that bus, because I heard that they have IDs to get on and off that bus at this point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5641.984s">Because</a> the email that I have in front of me, it says we currently have 104 eligible students that live in North Medford Heights area that have rode the bus at some point over the past three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5653.808s">Eligible.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5654.348s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5655.409s">And</a> that they issued bus passage to eligible students <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5660.115s">So</a> there are days that are a couple open seats, and other days we are over capacity by a few students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5666.278s">So</a> I just want to make sure nobody's over capacity driving and riding in any of our buses, especially the high school kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5674.341s">Their</a> backpacks are huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5676.102s">The</a> kids are bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5677.462s">There's</a> only two to a seat, realistically, not three. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5681.124s">And</a> so I would just like some data or like <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5684.487s">On</a> Mondays, this is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5686.348s">And</a> on Fridays, this is what happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5687.928s">And</a> Wednesdays, it goes crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5689.329s">And</a> if it rains, it's impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5691.33s">I</a> want to know so that way we are transporting our students safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5696.452s">And</a> that's all that matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5697.532s">So</a> I would like a report of that in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5701.494s">And</a> it's on the reports due list. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5705.315s">And</a> I would like that soon because we are halfway through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5710.193s">October</a> and we need to make sure all our children are transported safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5714.356s">I</a> would hate to have something happen.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5750.017s">That's</a> why I'd like the numbers, if you can provide them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5752.338s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GPyVAF2hz_Q&t=5753.698s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-10-20_c9BkgpEV0c8/2017-10-20_c9BkgpEV0c8.html">Medford Mayoral and School Committee Candidates Forum 10/12/17</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3829.846s">Hello,</a> I'm Erin DiBenedetto and I'm running for re-election to the Method School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3835.449s">My</a> goal as a committee member is to be a leader who has the experience and the relationships to deliver a solid innovation for Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3844.493s">Having</a> served three terms on the Method School Committee, I'm bringing my record of fighting for residents and community organizing to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3852.738s">As</a> a school committee member, I commit to work to make sure everyone in our district has the opportunity to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3860.92s">I</a> promise to be that honest voice of reason for all our Medford children. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3866.021s">My</a> husband Joe and I moved to Medford in 1987 and raised our two children, both of which graduated from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3875.623s">Joey</a> is a graduate of Worcester State University and is getting his master's degree in public health <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3883.602s">And</a> my Caitlin, she's a graduate of Tufts University and is getting her degree as a nurse practitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3891.268s">My</a> job as a special education coordinator for Prospect Hill Academy, where I advocate for children, gives me a unique insight to improving our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3903.318s">I</a> bring my knowledge of working in a school every day to our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3908.962s">In</a> 2011, when my youngest graduated, <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3912.526s">I</a> decided to run for Medford School Committee because my voice needed to be heard and because all children deserve the best education a city can offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3923.635s">Some</a> of the things that have been accomplished while working with other members of the committee have been to ensure we have a balanced budget with any need for supplemental appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3935.704s">Our</a> committee has creatively and resourcefully developed additional sources of revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3942.051s">The</a> planning and implementation of technology upgrades and our new science labs at Medford High School are major accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3950.913s">These</a> projects are not only offering the best education for our high school students, but they have increased programming for our vocational students. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3961.115s">As</a> a committee, we have reviewed new legislation regularly, <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3965.77s">Our</a> committees have submitted medical emergency plans, concussion plans, and bullying plans to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3974.256s">Upgrades</a> have been made at our Curtis Tufts School, as well as our Kids' Corner for our youngest learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3981.28s">We</a> have worked hard to keep our class size small. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3985.443s">We</a> have purchased new ELA and math programs for our elementary schools, and there have been many, many more accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=3994.617s">When</a> involved in interviewing and hiring our new principals or evaluating our superintendent, we always try to be the voice of the parents and the students in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4007.363s">While</a> we have done some amazing work, there is much more to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4011.625s">As</a> a committee, we need to ensure our students are prepared to compete globally for spots at our country's best universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4022.19s">We</a> are responsible to make sure the programs offered to our children are supported with the material and the supplies needed for our students to have maximum access to the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4035.538s">We</a> need to preserve our traditional vocational programs while we keep pace with the changing needs in our workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4043.864s">We</a> need to analyze our testing scores and make sure we are meeting the needs of all our students <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4049.578s">So</a> they all have every opportunity to excel. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4054.12s">We</a> need to build online learning opportunities so all students have a way to access the curriculum and we meet all our children's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4064.424s">We</a> need to invest in our buildings to maintain them for the years to come while working to keep our students and staff safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4073.305s">We</a> need to have open communication with administration, teachers, students, and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4080.328s">In</a> the coming years, this committee may be involved in hiring a new superintendent of schools, which I think is going to be one of the most important roles our future committee will be undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4093.913s">I've</a> learned from my many years of community involvement that some of the best ideas in government come from the neighborhoods, not the bureaucrats. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4103.562s">That's</a> why I'm asking you to reach out to me at 781-254-0095 with any ideas or concerns or ways that I can help you or your child. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4116.805s">That's</a> also a reason, while I am asking for your vote on November 7th to continue my work to be the honest voice of reason for all our Method children. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4128.908s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=60.601s">I</a> had a question on... So, we were talking about... <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=74.533s">additional</a> students that come from new developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=81.198s">And</a> we requested our report be given to us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=85.201s">I</a> just want more detail about what was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=89.023s">I</a> think I said I would like <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=92.025s">units</a> of 100 and above instead of the 150, and we would like to try to capture non-school age children as well as school age children, so we can pre-plan in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=103.728s">So</a> I would like that noted in the minutes as well as on the back of our requested reports.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=155.355s">Kirstine?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=156.255s">Yeah,</a> Kirstine.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=159.716s">Okay,</a> so my first question is in tuition reimbursement features, I saw a lot of line items for that, and I just didn't know what the policy was for tuition reimbursement because just in this bill approval, we have $7,684 in tuition reimbursement for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=178.302s">I</a> don't know how teachers apply for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=181.063s">I</a> don't know how it's allocated.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=206.482s">And</a> could you just explain how teachers apply for that and how they've been notified that they have that option?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=228.46s">And</a> now that you say that, I do remember approving that piece of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=232.963s">And</a> I'm glad to see it started.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=265.786s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=266.898s">I</a> have a few more items. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=268.859s">My</a> second item is on page three of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=271.241s">It's</a> for $3,395, and it says Medford High School miscellaneous charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=278.505s">Does</a> anybody have a recollection as to what, and the payment was, the vendor was Medford High School, so I was just curious what that was.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=288.211s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=291.252s">Hockey</a> uniforms? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=294.667s">Okay,</a> and the next item is number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=299.549s">An</a> athletic official on page 11 of 16, an athletic official bill was paid $10,220. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=305.911s">That</a> just seems so much higher than most of the other ones, and it just caught my eye.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=325.062s">Okay,</a> because, yeah, it just has that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=332.866s">Okay,</a> I was just curious, because it said an individual for that large amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=336.388s">It</a> just seemed worth bringing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=338.95s">And</a> number four is on page 12 of 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=343.112s">It</a> says, net sports group $8,998, and it says the reason is unclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=352.258s">So</a> I was just wondering why that wasn't classified, and exactly what that was.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=359.383s">It's</a> on page... Page 12.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=378.088s">Good</a> thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=379.409s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=380.05s">Okay,</a> thank you for clarifying those questions.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=530.518s">I</a> requested to have separate rankings and quarterly meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=534.502s">That's</a> not exactly what I had motioned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=537.525s">What</a> I had motioned for is a separate internal ranking, so that way we know which students in the vocational school and their class rank. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=547.274s">I</a> believe that's how I remember it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=549.736s">And</a> I also ask that a notation be presented on the transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=554.821s">And</a> if that's not possible, then I strongly agree with my colleague that the heads of both schools as well as the guidance department needs to come to us and tell us that our motion isn't possible and to present us with what options are possible and how we're going to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=573.597s">because</a> this is a very important issue for our seniors and our juniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=577.181s">At</a> least with our sophomores, we have time to notify them of this change. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=581.345s">It's</a> still going to be hard for that level, but at some point we need to merge them in with the high school rankings, because we do have one code now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=588.694s">and</a> that's how we report it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=591.477s">But</a> we need to make some adjustment for these two years, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=595.901s">And</a> that's why I made the motion, and that's why it was approved unanimously. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=600.025s">So</a> I'm agreeing with my colleague's motion, and I hope that happens very quickly, because this is affecting students that are already sent out applications to colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=611.415s">So</a> I motion that it be done immediately.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=689.636s">Could</a> we warrant, would this warrant an emergency meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=692.638s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=693.598s">Because</a> of the timeliness with children's transcripts. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=697.7s">So</a> as a school committee member, I'm making a motion that if they can't rectify this by the end of this week, that we have a meeting at the beginning of next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=706.725s">So</a> I need someone to second that motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=709.327s">It's</a> a second by Ms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1708.56s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1709.561s">So</a> I didn't hear that the teachers were upset until I saw the large group outside tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1716.251s">actually</a> happy to see a lot of you because I haven't seen you in a few years because both my children graduated from the McGlynn Elementary and Middle School and then Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1725.914s">So</a> it was really nice to see you all and see you still dedicated and acting in such a group way, such a team building way to represent yourselves in such <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1739.403s">A</a> difficult thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1740.304s">I'm</a> very sorry to hear that you felt slighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1744.908s">When</a> my children were going into middle school, it was hoping that they would get into the McLean. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1752.534s">So</a> when I hear the difference now with the Andrews, you know, it's like we all say, it goes up and down at different sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1760.64s">To</a> hear that you're educating 60% of the high needs students in our district in middle school, that's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1768.847s">60%</a> of your students in your school being high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1772.99s">That's</a> a tremendous job that you're doing every day and you're representing <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1776.753s">in</a> servicing children with very, very significant needs, and you're doing it really well, because if you weren't, I would have known that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1786.816s">I</a> would have known that and heard that, and that we would have had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1791.098s">We</a> never hear of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1792.438s">The</a> only thing we do hear is our friends are going to a different school, and you know, the emotional impact that has on people's children, and that breaks my heart, <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1803.992s">the</a> social emotional well-being of a child is so important to their education that we need to listen to how that's affecting people. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1812.916s">And</a> all our intention was last week is to find ways to make the McGlynn, you know, their marketing, their PR, to let people know about the wonderful things and the wonderful teachers that you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1827.819s">so</a> that parents are aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1829.82s">It</a> wasn't to say, well, the Andrews is better, how are we gonna make the McGlenn better? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1835.164s">We</a> know you're better. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1836.705s">We</a> never even thought for a second that you weren't better. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1840.728s">It's</a> just maybe you need a little bit more PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1844.23s">Maybe</a> your clubs need to be published a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1847.932s">Maybe</a> we need to have the paper there to celebrate some of your things. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1853.056s">In</a> other ways, that's how I looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1855.57s">Or</a> if you did need more money for clubs, I did ask for that, I believe, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1860.595s">Programs</a> that are working really well at the end, it was, why does the McGlenn not have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1864.538s">And</a> maybe we need to do that and look at those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1868.222s">But</a> it was never, never an issue that you weren't dedicated and wonderful, because that has never come to any of our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1875.983s">And</a> I am so grateful that you were comfortable enough to go ahead and speak for yourselves in this manner, that you thought that we had that impression. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1883.806s">And</a> that's far from what I thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1886.367s">So,</a> I am grateful to see you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1888.648s">I</a> hope you understand that we are here to help in any way that we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1893.57s">And</a> if you have ideas, we want you to bring them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1896.651s">You're</a> in the front line and you know better than anyone else in this room what you're doing every day and what needs to be celebrated and what needs to be sent out to the parents and the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1909.326s">So</a> your input is most valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1913.53s">And</a> I'm always willing to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1915.873s">And</a> I'm willing to make other people hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1918.616s">Because</a> I have a big mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1920.978s">So</a> welcome and thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1923.782s">And</a> I'm sorry that if it was an impression that wasn't pleasant for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=1930.658s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Benedetto.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2434.887s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2435.888s">Mayor</a> Burke, I'd like to make a motion that the administration meet with the teachers of the McGlen to go over some of these concerns, <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2444.783s">come</a> up with an action plan together and present the new action plan to the school committee in one month's time? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2452.93s">I</a> need someone to second that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2454.651s">Second.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2457.694s">Well,</a> yes, but at the very least. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2460.416s">A</a> meeting with them to work on a new action plan that needs to be presented.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2787.644s">Thank</a> you maverick and thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2788.944s">Mr.</a> McCullough <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2790.282s">First</a> of all, I'd like to clarify, 60% of high need students is not special education students. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2795.664s">Those</a> are students, when they take state level exams, they fall into different classifications, either ELL or different subgroups in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2805.969s">So</a> there's a lot of different combinations that could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2809.251s">So</a> I just didn't realize that it was at 60% capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2813.133s">I</a> knew our needs levels were different, and I knew that they housed the ELL program. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2818.575s">So</a> that would raise the number, but I just didn't know that it was at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2822.539s">So</a> just so everybody in the community knows, there's not 60% of the students at the McGlenn Middle School that are special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2830.886s">They</a> just fall into either financial need, or ELL need, or different types of subcategories that are tested on standardized testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2840.893s">The</a> second part about PR is, yes, we are all responsible for PR. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2846.875s">And</a> as a school committee member, I myself feel that way too. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2850.057s">In</a> any way I can help and do that, I am more than willing to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2853.638s">And</a> just to let the community know all the positives of both our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2859.521s">And</a> as far as going out and participating in the schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2863.518s">I</a> was actually at the exercise group at the elementary school at the McGlen last week trying to do hula hoop. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2870.642s">It</a> didn't work out very well in my favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2873.104s">But</a> I am trying to like pop into different things throughout the community and just see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2879.428s">So</a> like renew my own knowledge of each school too because my children have graduated and moved on and it's good to go back and you know, I went to parent night at the high school as a freshman parent would. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2893.63s">and</a> sat in the audience and just heard what questions were being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2898.853s">And</a> I know myself that my colleagues attend a lot of different things, and a lot of them have school-age children and are in the buildings at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2907.037s">And</a> for me, I have to make more of an effort to do that because my children have graduated. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2912.9s">So,</a> as far as that goes, that's the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2917.343s">And</a> by requesting a meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2921.272s">to</a> have their input for a new improvement plan or updated plan, not really an improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2929.696s">A</a> plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2930.237s">Just</a> an action.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2931.958s">An</a> action plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2933.398s">Sorry,</a> it went out of my mind for a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2937.16s">My</a> motion was to have a meeting on that because I want the teachers at the table and I want to be at the table as well and I want the superintendent to be there because we all need to be heard, not just us up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2950.094s">and</a> you were heard tonight, I hope you feel heard, in a different way, but with concrete items to talk about would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2961.424s">And</a> we might come up with the same or similar action plan in the end that's already been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2971.191s">it's</a> just that you might feel like you were heard and part of the process better, which is always great. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2976.772s">So,</a> I'm hoping that the strides we're making by holding, by taking an action. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2983.053s">I</a> didn't want the teachers to leave tonight without an action happening after tonight, and that's our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2989.574s">So,</a> and I agree with you that that needs to happen more and more from this membership. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=2996.916s">So,</a> thank you for bringing those concerns forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3816.368s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3816.888s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3817.829s">Thanks,</a> I had some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3819.389s">Okay,</a> so once you train everybody and they become a mentor, what do they do with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3824.492s">And</a> how do other children know that they're
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3851.911s">Okay,</a> so is this for all clubs, or just like sports clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3857.554s">No,</a> all clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3858.574s">Okay,</a> so and then the students in those clubs know that certain students in the club are trained mentors, so if they have an issue, they go to them?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3878.235s">And</a> thank you, I was just wondering how that all works. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3881.676s">So</a> if two children have an issue, they know that there's a mentor in it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3897.546s">That's</a> what I was just wondering how it actually happened that people knew about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=3902.23s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4094.15s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4095.511s">Thank</a> you Thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4097.373s">So</a> could any of these funds be help helpful with us since the whole community uses the school parks like if we need to redo all the rubber and the <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4108.204s">the</a> school year, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4110.326s">So</a> this can... We can put that request in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4113.068s">We</a> can start at each school each year and just keep rotating throughout forever.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4174.417s">I</a> meant the schoolyards. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4175.577s">The</a> schoolyards, where the play structures are to make them safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4179.298s">Yes,</a> that is definitely included. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4180.519s">They</a> are used all the time, evenings and weekends by the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4185.16s">It</a> would be really nice if we were first on the list, since I just.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4484.569s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4484.829s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4487.371s">How</a> do you decide? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4489.313s">Do</a> you decide that as a committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4491.791s">based</a> on all the input you've received throughout?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4973.87s">I</a> have the t-shirt in the car and all the other things that I go to take home. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4979.855s">Water</a> bottle. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4981.72s">from</a> many, many people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4983.861s">I</a> also wanted to comment that Hallmark Health took my blood pressure and the machine wasn't working well, so the vocational technical high school took it and they were right on. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4996.705s">Yeah,</a> mine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4997.305s">They're</a> healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=4997.985s">Yep.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5003.187s">It</a> was actually low that evening because I kept missing you in the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5006.508s">Let's</a> keep it that way.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5190.907s">Getting</a> back to the report at hand, so through this report, it looked like you might have been leading up to maybe staff changes and more people to run the school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5206.86s">And</a> that's how I read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5208.302s">And</a> so, I had some questions like, who already did our state reporting in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5214.031s">And</a> are they the point person for school brains at this point? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5220.351s">Once</a> they're up and trained isn't this going to streamline things so that way there'll be less people once the data is ended Initially and it's correct and updated by parents through the porthole and portal not porthole portal and Sorry, it's been a long day <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5239.935s">Once</a> that initial work is done and then people are trained in it, isn't it going to be much more efficient and accurate and we won't need additional staff because we'll have a good beginning?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5354.072s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5355.212s">I'm</a> gonna request that when we do meet and discuss that, we have like a layout of the administrative and the staffing, like who reports to who, what job they do, what their position is, what their salary is, like all of that data and information on like a graph so we see that and that way we can see the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5378.16s">And</a> it also helps tighten up what they're responsible for and who they directly report to. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5383.221s">So</a> when you do bring that to our attention, that's what I hope it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5388.004s">I'm</a> gonna leave it at that at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=5389.846s">I</a> think there's been a lot of motions for you tonight, so I'm not gonna make any motions, but just an idea.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6084.499s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6085.28s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6086.16s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6086.801s">Do</a> we have any data on non-athletic concussions? <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6090.003s">An</a> example is today at my school, at 745, we had an eighth grader trip and fall and fall into the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6098.909s">And</a> he was out. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6100.93s">So</a> I called the nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6103.798s">available,</a> so I had to call 911. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6107.12s">So,</a> I mean, that was a non-athletic concussion, possible concussion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6122.686s">Because</a> we want to make sure that even, you know, our clumsy students, no, no.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6149.034s">Right,</a> especially because those students also go back into classrooms as well and have to be cleaned in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6154.557s">And</a> the whole process has to be the same for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6157.518s">So</a> maybe that might be something we need to keep data on in the future, so when it's presented we have all students' data, not just athletic students. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6167.223s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6169.985s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6170.385s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/YlxkC9ZcZAw&t=6170.805s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-09-20_gXzvDPklqhM/2017-09-20_gXzvDPklqhM.html">Medford School Committee meeting September 18, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=977.752s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=979.632s">I</a> had a similar question to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=983.133s">So</a> my own question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=987.46s">If</a> someone had not petitioned for a specific district, then both parents would be on even still. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=995.663s">But</a> because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1001.965s">If</a> the other parent had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1008.727s">But</a> that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1011.508s">where,</a> like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=1019.771s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2623.935s">Probably</a> through Lisa and the school so that not everybody's kind of at the same time asking for things all during the school year They're officially open November 5th So, thank you for the report and I'm glad we're starting early Next time I'd like to come to that meeting make sure you're included <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2650.951s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2652.212s">My</a> real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2657.616s">Because</a> I don't know if they meal prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2666.542s">So</a> the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2682.734s">And</a> they will also have a restaurant on site as well within the Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2686.516s">Right,</a> that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=2691.139s">So</a> maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3125.198s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3126.739s">My</a> first thing is more of a statement than a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3129.66s">It</a> seems that the DESE is <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3134.838s">punishing</a> school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not so I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3161.322s">to</a> be accountable.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3171.473s">So</a> like when parents decided that they want to opt out, so they're holding the district's hands at pushing parents to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3183.415s">for</a> this, because districts are going to really push for every child to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3188.116s">And</a> I knew that we had an issue last year with the subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3196.939s">And</a> so, I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate was appropriate when we were taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3205.722s">So,</a> those are just some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3209.083s">We're</a> really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test But it's very important to the district that it does and the district does get punished from desi if not or held at a higher Accountability than districts that parents don't opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3224.497s">So</a> that's just a comment from what I've seen Secondly, I wanted to know <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3231.495s">So</a> the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3236.776s">As</a> a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3248.739s">It's</a> embargoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3249.599s">It's</a> embargoed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3250.139s">You've</a> got to ask the question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3287.712s">So</a> that's my other comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3289.233s">So</a> them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3298.459s">So</a> I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3305.403s">It</a> still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3357.163s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3357.403s">And</a> my point is, even though that we <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3360.002s">We</a> as a community are not accountable for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3362.965s">We</a> are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3367.97s">And</a> I don't want parents to think, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3378.44s">Entity</a> that to to our students and to to but have them do very well I just wanted to put that out there I don't like it when they say it doesn't come because it counts because the kids took the time to take the exam and you guys As a school district we spent a lot of time and a lot of money Making sure that we do this well and do it right so it does it does it counts? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3403.31s">And</a> it's the data <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3404.889s">We'll</a> use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3410.331s">So</a> that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3415.873s">So</a> to my colleague who's the committee chair of <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3420.721s">the</a> academic committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3422.262s">Last</a> year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3432.33s">We</a> could schedule the meeting and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=3436.192s">So</a> we know the results are coming the 24th.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5989.865s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5992.286s">So</a> I think I live in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=5995.444s">that</a> it used to be like North Street, and it used to be Winthrop Street over, you go to the Brooks, and then they redistricted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6003.052s">And</a> I didn't realize at the time it had been redistricted, so when people were talking to me, this was prior to me being on this committee, I was like, yeah, you just go down the street to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6014.243s">But</a> they had redistricted it, so it went to North Street, down, went to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6018.727s">To</a> the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6020.284s">from</a> North Street over was redistricted to the Columbus School, which wasn't as close, and where some people, like on my street, would have been able to walk their children to school, now live much further. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6035.096s">So</a> I think that's more what the concern was. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6038.339s">And</a> I have heard people in the Hillside area make comments like, I could walk my child every day, but I can't, it's too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6049.191s">Now</a> I have to bus them or bring them and it's because of that last redistricting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6130.665s">So</a> just to follow up, as a committee member, I do hear that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6135.326s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6135.546s">Vander</a> Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6136.046s">I</a> just comment on the district.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6290.506s">I</a> just had a question if you don't mind <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6294.65s">It</a> was about Study Island, how much that costs, and why has Andrews had it for a while and McGlenn not?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6360.224s">So</a> Okay at budget time we we heard from people that RTI was extremely important and a few committee members were really focused on this as being a budget item and now it wasn't and <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6377.072s">At</a> budget time and now we're purchasing stuff like we talked about staff maybe for RTI and there was talk about using people in the
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6410.248s">Great,</a> so my other comment is about the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6415.018s">Now,</a> Mr. DeLaver has been here for years asking more and more money for the clubs because they're so popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6421.618s">And</a> because it makes the children feel a part of that community and the social piece is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6427.841s">And</a> I think that is a big draw for the middle schoolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6431.622s">And</a> I remember either myself or someone else asking why can't we open it up to the McGlen kids and have them go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6440.766s">He</a> said they've tried it on a few occasions, if I remember correctly, I wish he was here, and that it really doesn't always work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6448.163s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we figure out a way that it does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6452.408s">And</a> I want not only the McGlynn kids to go over to Andrew's to take part, I want some really cool things at the McGlynn that draws those kids over. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6461.098s">Because</a> I really want, you know, the McGlynn has a little bit more space with them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6493.818s">So</a> the drama club that is excellent and it's well-reviewed at the Andrews School, could it be housed at the McGlynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6503.927s">Or</a> not? <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6504.688s">Because</a> the McGlynn has the auditorium.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6540.562s">So</a> I'm sure there's other children as well, and I would like it open to them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=6546.445s">Vandiver.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7330.352s">Mayor</a> Burke, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7331.813s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gXzvDPklqhM&t=7332.533s">As</a> far as buildings, what are the buildings, you know, when you go down 9th Street at the end, there's a new... 9th Street.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=980.484s">I</a> had a similar question to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=983.986s">So</a> my own question is, if someone had not petitioned for a specific district, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=992.726s">then</a> both parents would be on even still. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=996.409s">But</a> because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1002.734s">Like</a> if the other parent had done, had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1009.58s">But</a> that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1011.361s">So</a> we're like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=1020.629s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2651.778s">That's</a> fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2653.04s">My</a> real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2658.446s">Because</a> I don't know if they meal prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2667.376s">So</a> the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2683.561s">And</a> they will also have a restaurant on site as well, within the Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2687.344s">Right,</a> that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=2691.967s">So</a> maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3125.333s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3126.214s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3127.576s">My</a> first thing is more of a statement than a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3130.521s">It</a> seems that the DESE is <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3135.685s">punishing</a> school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not So I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3162.162s">to</a> be accountable.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3172.313s">So</a> like when parents decided that they opt out? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3176.578s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3177.038s">So</a> they're holding the district's hands at, you know, pushing parents to opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3184.242s">for</a> this because districts are gonna really push for every child to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3188.927s">And</a> I knew that we had an issue last year with the subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3197.784s">And</a> so I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate was appropriate when we were taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3206.566s">So</a> those are just some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3208.347s">So</a> I know parents were really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test, but it's very important to the district that it does, and the district does get punished from DESE if not, or held at a higher accountability than districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3222.991s">that</a> parents don't opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3225.313s">So</a> that's just a comment from what I've seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3228.495s">Secondly,</a> I wanted to know, so the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3237.622s">As</a> a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3249.938s">It's</a> embargoed? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3250.959s">You've</a> got to ask the question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3288.536s">So</a> that's my other comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3290.077s">So</a> them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3299.303s">So</a> I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3306.248s">It</a> still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3360.825s">We</a> as a community are not accountable for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3363.788s">We</a> are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3368.812s">And</a> I don't want parents to think, oh, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational entity that to our students and to <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3382.424s">to</a> have them do very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3384.965s">I</a> just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3386.746s">I</a> don't like it when they say it doesn't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3389.228s">Because</a> it counts, because the kids took the time to take the exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3392.25s">And</a> you guys, as a school district, we spent a lot of time and a lot of money making sure that we do this well and do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3399.974s">So</a> it counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3404.136s">And</a> it's the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3405.733s">We'll</a> use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3411.155s">So</a> that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3416.696s">So</a> to my colleague who's the committee chair of the academic committee, last year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=3433.11s">But</a> we could schedule the meeting, and then, so we know the results are coming in 24 hours.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5990.523s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5993.145s">So</a> I think I live in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=5996.305s">that</a> it used to be like North Street, and it used to be Winthrop Street over, you go to the Brooks, and then they redistricted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6003.411s">And</a> I didn't realize at the time it had been redistricted. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6007.515s">So</a> when people were talking to me, this was prior to me being on the Smoothman, I was like, yeah, you just go down the street to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6015.101s">But</a> they had redistricted it, so it went to North Street, down, went to the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6019.585s">It</a> was a Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6021.142s">from</a> North Street over was redistricted to the Columbus School, which wasn't as close, and where some people, like on my street, would have been able to walk their children to school, now live much further. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6035.948s">So</a> I think that's more what the concern was, and I have heard people in the Hillside area make comments like, I could walk my child every day, but I can't, it's too far, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6050.052s">Now</a> I have to bus them or bring them and it's because of that last redistricting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6131.525s">So</a> just to follow up, as a committee member, I do hear that as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6291.236s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6292.016s">I</a> just had a question, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6295.517s">It</a> was about Study Island, how much that costs, and why has Andrews had it for a while and McGlenn not?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6361.97s">Okay,</a> at budget time, we heard from people that RTI was extremely important and a few committee members were really focused on this as being a budget item, and now it wasn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6377.95s">At</a> budget time and now we're purchasing stuff like we talked about staff maybe for RTI and there was talk about using people in the building
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6411.111s">Great,</a> so my other comment is about the clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6415.893s">Now,</a> Mr. DeLaver has been here for years asking more and more money for the clubs because they're so popular and because it makes the children feel a part of that community and the social piece is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6428.837s">And</a> I think that is a big draw for the middle schoolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6432.498s">And</a> I remember either myself or someone else asking <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6437.54s">Why</a> can't we open it up to the McGlynn kids and have them go back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6441.645s">He</a> said they've tried it on a few occasions if I remember correctly I wish he was here and that it really doesn't always work <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6449.021s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we figure out a way that it does work. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6453.126s">And</a> I want not only the McGlynn kids to go over to Andrew's to take part, I want some really cool things at the McGlynn that draws those kids over. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6461.957s">Because</a> I really want, you know, the McGlynn has a little bit more space with them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6494.678s">So</a> the drama club that is excellent and is well-reviewed at the Andrews School, could it be housed at the McGlynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6504.849s">Or</a> not? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6505.57s">Because</a> the McGlynn has the auditorium.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=6541.439s">so</a> I'm sure there's other children as well, and I would like it open to them as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7332.846s">As</a> far as buildings, what are the buildings, you know, when you go down 9th Street at the end, there's a new.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7354.204s">Okay,</a> so all the condo buildings on 8th, 9th and 11th <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7359.835s">all</a> those buildings are not included in any of these lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7363.177s">Those</a> are existing, those are existing, and they've been there for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7366.139s">It's</a> just that apartment complex at the very end.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7408.388s">So</a> I did request this report, and it's because of future building, and we have the baseline now that we know where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7416.39s">I</a> have no problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7417.611s">The</a> only data that's not on here that I would like from the census piece is how many of these people are, how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7426.203s">younger</a> children, preschool age children, do they have that will be coming into our school district? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7431.811s">Because</a> they're newer apartments, they might, right, and that is something you would get from the census, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7437.739s">And</a> my only other concern is on the, I believe, third graph. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7442.775s">And</a> where it says school development enrollment percentage, I just want to keep an eye on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7448.742s">And</a> at the McGlynn, these new students, well, these new buildings affect 10%, almost 10%, 9.6% of their enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7458.332s">So</a> we want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7459.413s">Because</a> of geography. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7460.634s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7461.535s">That's</a> my whole point here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7463.197s">If</a> we're adding more. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7466.019s">apartments</a> or condos in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7469.203s">We</a> need to see where in the community is and which schools it's going to impact and how we want to deal with that ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7475.671s">We</a> want to be proactive not reactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7478.034s">So</a> like we just want to be careful with that and <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7481.518s">maybe</a> we redistrict any new building in this side, from this side over goes to this school, and this side over goes to this school, for future districting, not redistricting existing people. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7495.5s">Then</a> you get less people mad at you already that live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7499.761s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7500.381s">So</a> that's why I asked for this report, is I wanna be proactive, not reactive in how we place students, and to make sure that no one school is crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7511.083s">more</a> crowded than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7513.206s">So</a> this is good information, so I make a motion at this point to re-look at these numbers again at the end of the school year, so in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7523.498s">Perhaps</a> in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/VPiAObMovvI&t=7525.52s">See</a> if there's any changes.<h2><a href="../2017-09-13_DeDxs5cAHuk/2017-09-13_DeDxs5cAHuk.html">School Committee meeting September 11, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1065.793s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1066.213s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1067.475s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1069.596s">So</a> as the superintendent says, you know, change is good and difficult at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1077.963s">Whenever</a> you're growing, there's growing pains. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1080.385s">But</a> throughout change, what's necessary, and I think what hasn't happened here, is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1089.238s">So</a> I, as a school committee member, am very shocked to hear that there won't be a class valedictorian from the vocational program at graduation, because I pushed very many years ago to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1106.805s">That</a> happened and that they had a presence on the stage and they had a voice at graduation because it wasn't always celebrated as well as it is now at graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1120.053s">And</a> we celebrate both parts of our school together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1126.818s">So</a> to see that disappear is sad to me, because the programs are very different, and students work and excel in different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1137.025s">And</a> the way we pick valedictorian for one side of our programming might be different than how we pick it from another, and both have equal value. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1146.852s">And</a> those kids need to be celebrated and have that option and that moment to shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1155.984s">in</a> the same abilities that every other student is able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1161.509s">So</a> class rank, we're having this discussion about another subject with our new computer programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1170.778s">And</a> I as a parent really feel like that was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1176.983s">when</a> my child was applying for schools, because your class rank matters if you're applying to certain schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1182.847s">And</a> having that knowledge or knowing that if I just get that one more AP class or work a little harder in this section and I can meet that, I can be on the table for that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1194.115s">So</a> I do think that there's value there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1197.158s">And</a> putting these different programs in one <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1202.972s">one</a> bag isn't going to fare well for some of our top students in different sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1210.215s">So</a> we really need to look at the details and we need to be better at communicating the little things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1218.338s">Cause</a> if the school committee members didn't know about these issues, about people changing sides of where they sit and that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1228.964s">So</a> many things important to our juniors and seniors are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1233.446s">And</a> how do we expect our parents to know that, and our students to know that, and to come in and find that out in that manner isn't appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1242.631s">So</a> I agree, and I thank my colleague for bringing this forward with a strong voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1247.534s">And</a> I agree, I second your motion to have a committee meeting and <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1253.897s">I</a> invite all of our community to come forward and talk about the future of this merger.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1318.957s">I'll</a> wait until the next section. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1320.617s">Sorry,</a> I was jumping ahead.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1343.342s">I</a> had one question on bills.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1347.661s">I</a> think I approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1349.442s">I</a> approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1349.942s">And</a> I'll direct my question to the finance director after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1353.924s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1368.253s">I</a> just had a question on a legal fee for on page page 23 of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1375.017s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1377.884s">Sorry,</a> highlighted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1380.385s">On</a> page 17 of 47, payment of $600 to James Collins Esquire for school committee legal expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1391.03s">I'm</a> just curious, we have a lawyer on retainer, so I was wondering why we had a separate cost for a different lawyer.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1401.736s">Patterson?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1403.335s">either</a> to the superintendent or to the finances director.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1434.484s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1438.226s">Should</a> that be under special education then, or? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1440.968s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1441.388s">It</a> should be under special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1444.79s">It's</a> legal to. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1446.131s">OK,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=1447.132s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2703.976s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2704.937s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2706.317s">It</a> really does look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2707.398s">Our</a> class sizes are in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2710.579s">I</a> mean, some of them around 2021, which is the top that we'd like to be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2716.28s">But</a> overall, throughout the district, it looks <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2721.342s">very</a> well attended at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2723.984s">I</a> do see a lot of room at the Columbus school and the class sizes are much lower there and we talked about that a little bit before our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2733.171s">And</a> how we would like to maybe look at programs that could be moved to that school to add and free up some <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2741.782s">some</a> crowding at other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2744.845s">So</a> we want to keep that in mind for this year and maybe we can put some procedures or some implementation of those projects for this school year so that we're up and running with that and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2758.557s">But</a> the other thing which we're also talking about is, as a side note, on the back of that, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2768.565s">of</a> requested reports and I know some of the reports that were requested last year that weren't finished are not on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2777.348s">So</a> if you need me to look back, Superintendent Belson, and remind you which ones are outstanding, I can do that and email that to you this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2786.47s">If</a> not, if you do have it, I'd like to see it on next week's agenda so that way we follow through with any motions or resolutions that were asked for last year and that <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2796.613s">The</a> time went past and we didn't have enough time to finish those reports last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2802.096s">And</a> one of them, I believe, was how the new development is impacting our moment in our school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2812.002s">We</a> have had a few developments that have recently been opened in more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2818.946s">living</a> in those buildings, and we don't know how that's impacting our students or our populations at each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2826.293s">And</a> I requested it almost a year ago, might have been after January last year, and I know that that report wasn't forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2834.781s">And</a> I'm not saying that it's going to be easy to get those numbers, but I would like to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2841.065s">Moving</a> forward, if there is a lot of development in one district or one area or one elementary school area, do we have to look at maybe redistricting some of the newer buildings brought online to see if they could go to a school less populated and how we want to look at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2860.454s">And</a> we want to follow that this year because there are some, a lot of new building going on in the Wellington Circle area, which could affect both the McGlenn and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2870.843s">And</a> those are our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2872.525s">I</a> mean, yeah, the McGlenn and the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2874.727s">And</a> those are our schools with the highest population of students, if you look. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2878.943s">They're</a> both over 500 students, our close are over 500 students, and our other two schools have less.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2977.871s">those</a> future developments could impact us. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2980.653s">Those</a> having the present numbers will help us know what the prediction is for the next.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2988.598s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=2988.998s">So</a> there is a motion on the floor to have that report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3439.647s">No,</a> I have a question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3449.249s">There</a> was a question whether the doors could be looked at because some of them don't close very well in the kid's corner as well as check the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3458.271s">Some</a> of them need some updating.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3491.945s">Just</a> want to be careful of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3493.345s">So</a> I don't know if they swell up or anything, or what the situation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3497.918s">but</a> if you could look at that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3831.264s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3831.944s">So,</a> sorry I jumped in too early before, but <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3835.385s">Since</a> we're having power washers, are we going to be washing the windows at some of the buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3840.27s">I</a> know it's very difficult to get to the exterior, and you need specialized equipment, especially like the Andrews and the McGlynn, and how you get back to the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3851.04s">But</a> it makes a tremendous difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3854.103s">And</a> if we haven't done it in a very long time, I know it's extremely expensive, but I really feel like
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=3902.005s">Please</a> keep it in mind.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4487.93s">Mr.</a> Benavetto and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4490.011s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4490.912s">So</a> are there any issues right now, buses arriving late to the school buildings, or are they coming on time?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4514.869s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4515.229s">I</a> know there's a lot of construction throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4517.734s">you</a> know, the city right now, and I was just wondering if it was impacting parents or buses from getting to, like, for example, up to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4527.678s">I</a> know that there was a lot of cars coming up for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4531.74s">And</a> I just was wondering if maybe even a principal, head of school had seen any or had had children coming in late because... It's certain that construction and traffic certainly does impact bus arrivals.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4553.478s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4554.158s">And</a> my second question is, what are the number of students taking the bus to Minuteman and the enrollment in Minuteman now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4561.281s">Eight.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4562.551s">eight</a> students, so we only have eight students attending Minute Man. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=4565.935s">Wow,</a> that's phenomenal.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5434.104s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5436.886s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5437.626s">I'd</a> also like to get some notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5440.888s">It's</a> very helpful for the school committee members to get notifications of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5446.151s">If</a> we could be added to the school bearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5449.773s">In</a> some capacity, I'd like to request to do that as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5518.196s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5519.937s">Just-</a> Off subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5522.298s">About</a> the subject, but St. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5523.719s">Clement's</a> closed their doors, so I don't think we're busing to them anymore.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5534.465s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=5535.306s">We're</a> not busing there anymore.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6810.378s">Is</a> there any way that we could provide services as if they were homeschooled students, that we could provide some curriculum-based information that at least the children are being educated, even if it is at home for the time being, until the parents can take further action or we can somehow try to help this family work this issue out? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=6844.206s">Are</a> they considered enrolled?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7451.797s">Mayor</a> Burke? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7454.919s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7456.059s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7457.52s">I</a> was able to come to the parent information night for the freshmen and juniors last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7464.143s">And</a> this was announced that it was happening up at the high school and for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7469.966s">And</a> I agree with the change in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7473.3s">First</a> of all, you have hundreds of kids walking through the hallways at the same time, and they're going to have their phones out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7479.504s">So</a> you're grabbing one out of many that are doing it in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7484.587s">So</a> there's no consistency in trying to get them all to not use their phones. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7488.749s">Secondly,</a> I feel like a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7490.77s">Our</a> newer students, they keep their calendar, I mean, their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7494.492s">They</a> take a picture of their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7496.233s">And</a> that's what they use so they're not going through the backpacks in the hallway and tripping other people trying to find their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7502.597s">Because</a> they use their phone to get from, OK, which building am I going and what class am I in now? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7509.201s">And</a> they pull it up on their phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7511.643s">Children</a> today use electronics much more readily than ever before, and that's how. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7520.348s">They</a> work everything, and there's people here tonight taking all notes of what's going on on their iPads, whereas I would probably have my pen and paper, which I did last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7529.653s">It's</a> just a different generation, and we need to encourage them to use electronics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7534.596s">As</a> far as passing in the hallways, it's not when you're going to the bathroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7538.778s">It's</a> only when the bell rings and you have those three to five minutes to get from one class to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7544.141s">It's</a> like you can't leave class and go out in the hallway and use your phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7548.804s">That's</a> when it will be enforced. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7551.306s">That's</a> the explanation that I got the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7555.388s">There</a> were other questions that parents had that night, which I'd like to go over either with the headmaster himself or announce later. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7564.495s">That</a> came out of, I took notes that people are asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7567.738s">Also,</a> the students can go to the gym now at lunchtime, which I think is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7571.621s">And</a> they're walking and they're doing different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7574.583s">They're</a> playing basketball, so if kids need to blow off steam or need to move around, that's now allowed too. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7581.249s">There</a> was a lot of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7583.15s">in</a> quality of student life, I felt like, and upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7588.576s">I</a> went because my children have graduated so long ago, I thought it was important to see what it was like to be a parent going through the orientation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7598.226s">And,</a> you know, there was a lot of new things being implemented that I didn't know about, and I learned a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7603.993s">But</a> I agree with <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7606.503s">this</a> new policy for electronics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7609.525s">I</a> believe kids are going to use them anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7612.227s">And</a> I believe that we can enforce this more equally. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7616.31s">And,</a> you know, I think we should move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7619.633s">And</a> I make a motion to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=7624.076s">Dr.</a> Perrella.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8201.822s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8203.963s">I</a> also want to take this opportunity to let you know that there was a request at the meetings last week from parents to have more of meetings that are taking place up at the high school videotaped and put onto school brains or distributed to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8222.769s">So</a> because some people don't have <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8226.485s">No,</a> like the parent information, freshman and junior parent information night. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8231.868s">Some</a> parents didn't have the availability to come to those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8235.31s">And</a> now that we have the technology in this room, or any other, even awards, like not just award ceremonies, but informational things, or putting the PowerPoint presentations up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8250.438s">I</a> don't know if that's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8251.539s">I</a> know that there were administrators here and they did take those notes back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8256.158s">But</a> I thought I would express that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8257.699s">And</a> there was some concern about electives now being passed field. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8262.042s">And</a> how that, they had questions about how that would affect students GPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8266.604s">So</a> I know we're going to be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8269.499s">those</a> type of things soon, and I just wanted to bring that to your attention.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8384.294s">Okay,</a> and another last is more notification before, like, guidance coffee hours, more than a week notice for parents so they can arrange things in their scheduling. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8396.042s">That</a> was another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8398.544s">Also,</a> are we having an SAT informational session for, and you may not know this, Kathy DiMedaglio may not, for parents with disabilities about how <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8410.982s">if</a> they need extended time on SATs or PSATs, how parents or students with disabilities, is there a way to request that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8421.608s">That</a> was another question that came up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8462.477s">So</a> some clarification may be needed for junior parents taking PSATs about who contacts College Board with a request, just on some information I saw recently distributed to parents, just in a spoken way, and some clarification about how you get your accommodations done and who actually calls the College Board, who presents the data <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8492.248s">for</a> that decision to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8493.929s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8582.706s">So</a> as the team lead for any junior parent who was, because we're all taking the PSATs for free this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8589.885s">because</a> of a grant, if I'm correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8593.248s">So</a> have all parents whose students have a 504 on IEP been notified? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8600.752s">that</a> in order for their children to have accommodations, the school is, is the school providing the information?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8617.069s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8617.589s">So</a> that should have taken place through the guidance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8620.793s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=8621.477s">So</a> what I'm saying is that did not come out of the meeting the other night, and I think some clarification is needed.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9299.546s">I</a> just want some clarification about exactly what accounts this is talking about.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9325.036s">Okay,</a> so those are accounts that the principal and the school district has, like not PTO accounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9330.66s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9331.733s">Not</a> any outside groups, not any friends of, this is just like clubs, like the robotics club up here might have an account.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9355.355s">So</a> if they have an event and raise money, those funds go back in? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9359.2s">Are</a> they kept separate for those groups? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9362.785s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9363.466s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9364.267s">And</a> any time they need to access those funds, they have the right to, no matter
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9387.89s">Identify</a> what was needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9389.391s">So</a> for Clara picture can be audited as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9391.953s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9392.533s">Plus</a> we budgeted a certain dollar amount.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=9401.079s">I</a> didn't know if that was including budgeted allowances for those outside activities.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10307.608s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10308.368s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10308.988s">I</a> have two part questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10310.329s">First</a> of all, I want to make sure that, um, the glitch in the system for that particular student didn't, um, have any effect on her applying to any colleges or her or class ranking or any longterm things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10329.277s">So</a> I don't know if you know that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10331.89s">or</a> if the headmaster knows, if that was, you know, like if she's already applied, you know, early decision in first quarter is a little late for that GPA to be changed or that class ranking to change, is that going to affect her in any adverse way? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10347.624s">So</a> I just want someone to follow up and make sure that that's not the case and that we don't need to fix it prior to the end of first quarter grades.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10378.969s">All</a> right, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10379.529s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10380.57s">The</a> second part of my question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10411.305s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10411.885s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10412.445s">I'm</a> glad it was all resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10414.346s">And</a> that's what I just wanted to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10416.927s">So</a> the second part of my question is more for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10421.248s">So</a> I just want clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10424.009s">With</a> the new key teacher contract, what is the expectation of how often and how quickly <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10432.392s">And</a> how much data teachers are required to put in in the use of school brains or provide training. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10439.977s">Like</a> homework assignments, are they being posted daily? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10444.52s">I</a> don't know exactly what the new contract says and I'm just curious what their obligation is and how that's affecting our teaching staff.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10491.224s">So</a> my question's more directed to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10494.765s">like</a> what's the expectation of parents using only school brains and to use that as homework assignments and that way of communication with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10506.349s">If</a> they need to send an email, they do it through the school brain so the teacher becomes more, it becomes more of a habit for the teacher as well as the parents to utilize this new system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10516.752s">So</a> it's the first go-to for everybody because I know that in prior years to having school brains, <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10524.255s">Parents</a> were saying, for three different children in the district, they would have three different ways to communicate with parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10530.517s">So</a> I want to know what the expectations are from our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10533.859s">Now</a> that we've had it a whole year, for this school year, what are we expecting our teachers to do and how often to post important information to parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10546.923s">Is</a> this the only way that we're expecting them to do that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10624.315s">So</a> this was part of the reasoning for going with the new system was to consolidate <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10632.002s">So</a> parents didn't have to go to three places. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10634.403s">And</a> that's the ultimate goal for the district K-12, and even preschool. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10641.787s">So</a> I would like to stop people on that, especially in our early grades, and build straight through. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10647.93s">So</a> I do think that it does affect our elementary teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10652.433s">If</a> they're assigning homeworks, and parents can go on at night and just check and say, oh, you forgot tomorrow is <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10659.367s">you</a> get to bring your special thing and do it at show and tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10662.577s">So</a> let's pick it out now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10664.338s">So</a> I think it's an important tool that everyone in the district is consistent throughout the district, every school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10671.102s">So</a> if you could talk to your principals and your leaders throughout the district and really at their meetings with their teachers, tell them that this is what the expectations are moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10685.831s">So</a> that way, even in our preschool K classes, those teachers are using this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10691.77s">all</a> the way through our seniors.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10738.637s">So</a> is our other areas of the district doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10743.823s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10744.003s">Caldwell,</a> is your area doing that as well as the middle schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10749.038s">Like</a> I want consistency K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10751.679s">I</a> don't just want the high school to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10754.26s">I</a> want, if I have a fourth grader and a second grader and an eighth grader and a kid graduating, I want to go into one system.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10781.667s">Can</a> we encourage people to start using it in this fashion because of a request from parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10789.377s">Because</a> that's what we're hearing through the district?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10799.966s">I</a> haven't heard as much of it recently, but when we were deciding on this program, I did hear <a href="https://youtu.be/DeDxs5cAHuk&t=10808.413s">many</a> Facebook messages from parents telling me how important that was and how frustrating it was in the evenings, trying to figure out.<h2><a href="../2017-05-22_69E5Q7WOK_c/2017-05-22_69E5Q7WOK_c.html">Medford School Committee meeting replay from May 15, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=729.719s">No,</a> that's not first.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=1708.305s">Really?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=1709.405s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=1709.866s">Congrats.</a>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3546.352s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3547.853s">I</a> had a couple others, Mr. Bellson, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3551.257s">On</a> page 6 of 13, under <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3559.179s">Method</a> High miscellaneous charges, it's woodwind and brass wind, $2,125. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3567.744s">Is</a> that for equipment for our high school band, or it just says miscellaneous charges, it's not like directed to a department or anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3576.31s">It</a> said page six. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3577.611s">Page</a> six of 13, three quarts, it's about eight pounds.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3589.138s">Okay,</a> it just seemed unusual to have a miscellaneous charge of that amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3595.262s">On</a> account.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3614.435s">Once</a> I saw what it was it was it made it perfect sense, okay?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3639.846s">Great,</a> so we'll get a report on that.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3644.448s">And</a> then my last question is the last two items on the list on page 13 of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3650.611s">And</a> it's professional technical services educational, and there's a person's name with the amount of like $2,500 total.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3664.318s">The</a> last two line items.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3671.306s">The</a> last page 13 of 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3674.549s">Last</a> two items listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3676.13s">The</a> last two.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3685.407s">Yeah,</a> I was just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3686.587s">Yeah,</a> I'd just like to, before I, yeah.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3691.148s">Just</a> like sometimes, a little information and knowledge, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3693.889s">Sure,</a> I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3695.169s">I</a> have no problem with approving the bills and hearing back from the superintendent about that item.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3746.656s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3748.935s">I</a> know at this meeting we had a very productive meeting and we met with all the principals as well as some teaching staff and it was really good insight as to what's going on at each building and how they use the funds that they were allocated this year and what their needs are for next year and I appreciate the manner in which it's all presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3767.408s">But</a> at that meeting we were supposed to have a secondary agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3770.85s">And</a> it's not listed in the minutes, and it wasn't presented at that night, the PTO information. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3776.393s">So</a> I would like it added to the minutes because we had moved that report to the subcommittee meeting, and then it didn't happen at subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3784.277s">So</a> I want it noted that it didn't happen there. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3786.958s">So</a> if you could amend these notes and bring them back to us at our next meeting for approval, I'd be happy with moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3793.701s">It's</a> still under request of report. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3796.523s">I</a> know but I want it noted that it was discussed this evening and that it was supposed to be discussed and brought up at that subcommittee meeting and it wasn't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3810.355s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=3812.577s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4361.346s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4364.213s">When</a> we were talking last week with some of the principals, there was a strong request for RTI staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4373.5s">Is</a> this $17,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4374.861s">What</a> would that go towards?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4402.2s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4402.88s">So</a> there was a request for that, and there was a lot of talk about the need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4407.361s">And</a> I'd like your opinion on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4471.344s">Does</a> that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4476.027s">what</a> was helpful to me is that there were some teachers present and they explained that they do on their own time, early morning, lunch time, and I know teachers do that in general, and I know that not all teachers can do that because of their home situations, they might not have that ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4493.132s">You</a> know, young children, different reasons that they can't, and I just want to make sure that, you know, kids that need tier two and tier three, they need more than the materials, and some children, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4505.757s">You</a> know, we, what my goal here is to growth in MCAF scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4510.42s">And</a> I really believe that having people, you know, work with those kids that are so close to moving to the next level, that if we do have services in place that our schools will grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4523.71s">And</a> that's, that's the community goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4525.571s">Not</a> only the school committee goal or administrative goal or teacher goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4529.974s">You</a> know, that's a community goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4531.754s">So</a> I just want to make sure that if that's the need, in order to make that growth happen, that we meet that need for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4542.225s">Sometimes,</a> I know the superintendent talks a lot about differentiating instruction, and I agree with that wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4548.512s">But</a> we're at a point now that we really need to make strides and want to make strides in growth with our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4555.319s">And</a> if this is the step necessary, I really would like to look at that before we close this budget, so that way we can appropriate the correct funding for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4564.775s">So</a> any time that you have to look at this prior to budget, I would like to hear from you and the administrative team. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4573.198s">You</a> guys are the experts, but I also heard from the front lines already. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4577.279s">So</a> I'm going to take that very seriously as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4616.757s">And</a> I understand in ELA, our scores are a little higher than they are in the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4621.798s">So,</a> you know, I'm going to ask the same questions about math because district wide, our math scores are good, but like there's room for growth in any situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4633.161s">So</a> I know ELA, it might be a little different than it is the situation and the scenario with the math. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4639.863s">So</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4640.843s">And</a> I look forward to hearing more from you before the budget about, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4645.674s">what</a> you really think that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4648.035s">And</a> I just really want you to speak to some of the people on the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=4651.377s">I</a> know you do on a daily basis.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6134.876s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6136.139s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6137.362s">My</a> question is actually directed towards the mayor and it's in regard to the summer <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6143.158s">Recreation</a> book if that is when to print today.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6168.733s">Will</a> there any be up at the library just in case people are down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6173.077s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6174.059s">Thank</a> you Yes
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6341.589s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6342.909s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6344.369s">I</a> think this is a great idea, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6351.711s">There</a> has been significant parent presence at some of our meetings worried about the class size and where space was available at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6362.452s">And</a> I really believe that this is a really <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6365.554s">good</a> way to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6367.055s">And</a> we can watch it closely next year and make any other adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6371.798s">All</a> that I ask is if it does cause hardships to individual families, that you take that into account and work with those families and make sure that the transition works well for those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6386.688s">And</a> if there's great hardship of separating siblings, you keep that in mind when placement is necessary.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6751.987s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6753.105s">Thank</a> you for those updates, Superintendent Felsen, through Madam Maber.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6761.211s">I</a> know. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6761.572s">I'm</a> picking up your habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6765.655s">So</a> we haven't discussed, as the chairperson of the school committee, we haven't discussed the superintendent's review, his annual review. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6773.881s">So</a> I'm requesting that you start that process through you for the superintendent's annual review. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6782.607s">so</a> we can have that before the end of our session, before summer break. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6788.309s">So</a> I would like to move forward on making sure that we do our due diligence as a committee and do his annual review. <a href="https://youtu.be/69E5Q7WOK_c&t=6796.152s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2017-05-09_2Xo4xfl-Zsw/2017-05-09_2Xo4xfl-Zsw.html">Medford School Committee meeting May 1, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1000.386s">I</a> just want to thank your office for taking on this responsibility and getting this information out to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1008.392s">I</a> hope it helps a lot of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1014.899s">students</a> that normally wouldn't get a high end scholarship because the GPA is very reasonable and it's for the average working hard student and I'm really glad to see that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1028.254s">Thank</a> you for your office and your help.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1439.192s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1440.713s">Just</a> out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1460.121s">Good</a> to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1460.882s">I</a> really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like that partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1470.474s">with</a> Tufts University, and I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1475.957s">So</a> I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted, and then how many can afford to go after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1481.721s">And</a> I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1490.206s">But</a> also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1496.95s">I</a> mean, it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1498.135s">It's</a> like a world-renowned school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1500.557s">And</a> it's got people from all over the world coming.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1774.441s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1775.342s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1776.202s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1777.023s">$18,000</a> towards educational services regarding drug addiction in any way, shape, or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1784.528s">There's</a> money coming in and we don't <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1787.667s">I'm</a> really happy to see that they've allocated funds throughout the community, and we were recipient of such a large sum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1795.65s">I</a> just wanted to talk to you a little bit about working with Penny from the city side, because she's amazing, and her department is amazing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1804.693s">So</a> she might have some ideas.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1835.293s">My</a> other only suggestion is as far as the community piece, we have a group in the community, Method Against Addiction, and it's really well run and well <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1844.995s">developed,</a> and they really have the hands on what's happening in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1850.797s">So</a> I would reach out to that group as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1854.378s">I</a> mean, they're phenomenal, and they're very receptive and very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1858.159s">And</a> my last piece is for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1861.481s">I</a> know that Cheryl just received an award from the- Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1866.622s">Citizen</a> of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1867.422s">And</a> I've attended her, I've been to her group to observe what goes on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1873.725s">And</a> it's for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1875.453s">of</a> people who are addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1877.014s">And</a> everybody thinks it's the older. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1878.995s">It</a> could also be students within our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1884.077s">And</a> just get that perspective as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1887.478s">So</a> you're getting both the school, the city side, the great program, Method Against Addiction, which brings people together, make them feel like a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1899.083s">And</a> you're also getting adults that are struggling with, how do I cope with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1903.925s">type</a> of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1904.505s">So</a> we could really, you know, unite as one with, I know it's only 18,000, but that's, that's a good amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1911.147s">And</a> it's just some different ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1912.528s">Cause</a> if you do an outreach, speak to the people that you're going to outreach to, the parents, the people in the sit-in street, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1921.411s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1953.509s">Good</a> grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1954.09s">One</a> more thing, ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1956.111s">Oh,</a> sorry.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1959.795s">So</a> I also, about two years ago, the governor had people come out to the community, and I went to a few of the meetings, they were in Somerville, and they were trying to figure out what the state needed to do as a team, and they were talking about mandates for schools and stuff, and I raised my hand, and I was like, are they gonna be funded mandates, or are they gonna be burdened to the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1982.194s">And</a> I was assured that, of course, they would be funded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1985.803s">But</a> I haven't seen those mandates yet, and I was wondering if the superintendent had gotten any mandates yet from- Funded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=1993.584s">Or</a> unfunded.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2000.386s">Or</a> even unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2001.326s">Are</a> there any new mandates within the school district?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2004.686s">But</a> they haven't come out yet.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2599.123s">Um,</a> so this is the recommendation that we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2605.687s">And</a> if we move forward with this, we would need to receive $265,400 match. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2612.574s">and</a> we would get close to $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2614.515s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2615.495s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2617.196s">I</a> also would like to know what we're budgeting in addition to this on an annual basis to make sure that we're also making a commitment on a line item in our budget as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2627.701s">Because</a> we did the $3 million bond a few years ago for technology, and then we had a few slow years, and then we're asking for more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2637.226s">What</a> I'd like to see is a commitment to technology throughout our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2641.458s">throughout</a> every year so that way we don't, you know, when these opportunities arise, it's for bonus stuff, not the everyday stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=2650.612s">Do</a> you understand what I'm saying, superintendent?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3951.548s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3952.389s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3953.729s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3955.513s">First</a> of all, I want to shout out to you and to Alicia Hunt on the new lighting at the Curtis Tough School.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3962.936s">That</a> was requested a few years ago and that took a lot of work to get the grant and get the money and all the work that's been done at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3971.74s">Don't</a> forget to bring the prisoners back and finish the paint job there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3993.89s">I</a> know that they were talking about relocating some office space and do you have any updates on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=3999.252s">Like</a> where the kitchen is and the cabinets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4001.293s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4006.912s">Maybe</a> we'll talk about it You know, it's it's funny because maybe it could be a program a program like the kitchen area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4018.339s">Well,</a> that's that's my point Not only do we need the cabinet that we could also use a vocational if they plan it as a project sure So maybe we could start now Talking to the director of yeah, absolutely <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4032.644s">And</a> maybe have that be a work project that throughout the city and have our own children learning right there and interacting with the other students that go to that school at the same time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4055.197s">So</a> I, I support a hundred percent your request for an additional carpenter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4060.119s">There's</a> a lot of buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4062.602s">and</a> a lot of maintenance, and our buildings are aging every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4067.805s">And</a> as the superintendent has committed funds to maintaining and upkeeping and grading, I, as committee member, am going to support your requests that you have asked for in this budget request. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4080.67s">I</a> also wanted to ask you, you listed that at the Andrews Middle School, you're in need of a floor scupper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4087.554s">Do</a> you know how much that is?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4100.525s">Good</a> to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4102.266s">Just</a> because I had no idea, like, a cost value of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4106.287s">So</a> you need a carpenter and $6,000 in addition to the $200,000 that the superintendent is going to add to the light items.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4121.655s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4122.716s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4122.916s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4123.597s">Thank</a> you, John, for all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2Xo4xfl-Zsw&t=4124.878s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=275.273s">Thank</a> you for your office and your help.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=686.71s">Just</a> out of curiosity, do you know how many students have been accepted to Tufts University this year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.156s">Good</a> to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=707.916s">I</a> really, since we have one of the best colleges in the world here in our city, I really like <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=716.162s">that</a> partnership with Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=718.623s">And</a> I know that they look closely at taking both Method and some of those students. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=722.984s">So</a> I'm just always curious as to how many get accepted and then how many can afford to go after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=728.766s">And</a> I know that Tufts can be generous at times with our students, having a daughter who graduated from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=737.229s">But</a> also because I want to keep that opportunity for our children in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=743.971s">I</a> mean, it's a great <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=745.173s">It's</a> like a world-renowned school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=747.615s">And</a> it's got people from all over the world coming.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1051.729s">So</a> she might have some ideas.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1082.329s">My</a> other only suggestion is as far as the community piece, we have a group in the community, Method Against Addiction, and it's really well run and well <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1092.035s">developed</a> and they really have the hands on what's happening in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1097.836s">So</a> I would reach out to that group as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1101.417s">I</a> mean, they're phenomenal and they're very receptive and very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1105.198s">And</a> my last piece is for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1108.519s">I</a> know that Cheryl just received an award from the- Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1113.66s">Citizen</a> of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1114.46s">And</a> I've attended her, I've been to her group to observe what goes on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1120.762s">And</a> it's for the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1122.49s">of</a> people who are addicted. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1124.071s">And</a> everybody thinks it's the older. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1126.032s">It</a> could also be students within our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1131.114s">And</a> just get that perspective as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1134.515s">So</a> you're getting both the school, the city side, the great program, Method Against Addiction, which brings people together, make them feel like a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1146.14s">And</a> you're also getting adults that are struggling with, how do I cope with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1150.96s">type</a> of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1151.56s">So</a> we could really, you know, unite as one with, I know it's only 18,000, but that's, that's a good amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1158.203s">And</a> it's just some different ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1159.584s">Cause</a> if you do an outreach, speak to the people that you're going to outreach to, the parents, the people in the citizen street, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1168.445s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1201.195s">One</a> more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1202.055s">Oh,</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1204.535s">Can</a> she just finish? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1206.836s">So</a> I also, uh, about two years ago, the governor had, um, people come out to the community and I went to a few of the meetings, um, they were in Somerville and they were trying to figure out what the state needed to do as a team and they, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1221.028s">They</a> were talking about mandates for schools and stuff and I rose my hand and I was like, are they going to be funded mandates or are they going to be burdened to the cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1229.217s">And</a> I was assured that of course they would be funded mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1232.837s">But</a> I haven't seen those mandates yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1234.758s">And</a> I was wondering if the superintendent had gotten any mandates yet from. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1238.86s">Funded</a> mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1240.461s">Or</a> unfunded.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1247.445s">Or</a> even unfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1248.386s">Are</a> there any new mandates within the school district?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1251.707s">But</a> they haven't come out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1252.888s">The</a> governor was doing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1847.646s">So</a> this is the recommendation that we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1852.731s">And</a> if we move forward with this, we would need to receive $265,400 match. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1856.294s">And</a> we would get close to $400,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1857.416s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1857.836s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1864.242s">I</a> also would like to know what we're budgeting in addition to this on an annual basis to make sure that we're also making a commitment on a line item in our budget as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1874.744s">Because</a> this, like we did the $3 million bond a few years ago for technology and then we had a few slow years and then we're asking for more. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1884.246s">What</a> I'd like to see is a commitment to technology throughout our system throughout every year so that way we don't, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1892.673s">when</a> these opportunities arise, it's for bonus stuff, not the everyday stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=1897.474s">Do</a> you understand what I'm saying, superintendent?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3198.604s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3200.224s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3201.868s">John,</a> first of all, I want to shout out to you and to Alicia Hunt on the new lighting at the Curtis Tough School.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3209.99s">That</a> was requested a few years ago and that took a lot of work to get the grant and get the money and all the work that's been done at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3218.792s">Don't</a> forget to bring the prisoners back and finish the paint job there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3240.934s">I</a> know that they were talking about relocating some office space and do you have any updates on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3246.296s">Like</a> where the kitchen is and the cabinets of, yeah, well it's like,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3256.927s">Maybe</a> it could be a program like the kitchen area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3265.392s">Well,</a> that's my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3268.273s">Not</a> only do we need the carpenter, we could also use a vocational if they plan it as a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3273.856s">So</a> maybe we could start now talking to the director of... Yeah, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/sDVXXKyS5x4&t=3279.698s">And</a> maybe have that be a work project that throughout the city and have our own children learning right there and interacting with the other students that go to that school at the same time.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=620.535s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=622.256s">First</a> of all, I want to say thank you to you and your staff for implementing this in such a quick way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=628.518s">300</a> kids in three days is a lot to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=632.099s">I</a> also think that opening the communication with children in this manner is very, very positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=637.68s">So</a> that way, if something were to come arise, you've already had that initial contact with somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=645.101s">you</a> might feel comfortable going to them, even for other issues that might come about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=649.684s">So</a> I really think that the process is good for all our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=653.626s">I'm</a> glad so many participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=656.488s">So</a> out of the 32, my concern was, OK, do we notify parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=661.671s">How</a> do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=662.711s">I</a> know it's confidential, but especially those seven students that some red flags were drawn, at what point do we?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=684.126s">So</a> are we going back as confidential employees or nurses or guidance Councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=690.883s">to</a> check on those students in like a few months and just say, hey, how's everything going?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=716.671s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=717.231s">Especially</a> for the two students that refuse <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=720.296s">the</a> referral. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=722.277s">We</a> just don't want anybody to fall through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=724.238s">And</a> I'm sure that's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=726.74s">So</a> thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=727.78s">And</a> I think that conversation with seventh graders is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=731.162s">That</a> will be next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=732.303s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=732.903s">So</a> I also think that open that line of communications very early with children. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=737.205s">They're</a> mature. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=738.286s">They're</a> seeing stuff that we don't even know that they're seeing in middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=742.048s">So</a> I think it's good to acknowledge it and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=746.15s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=747.431s">Motion</a> to accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=748.351s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1105.503s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1106.043s">I</a> remember Coach Perry talking about how different things that they did at certain grade levels, and I know that drinking and driving was part of the health curriculum at this grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1120.692s">And</a> I don't know if it's still the case, but when I was on the Method High School PTO, they used to bring in speakers for different classes and different grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1130.916s">And</a> one of them was yellow dress about dating violence and the other one was about alcohol awareness and driving and those type of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1139.679s">So</a> we could also check with the PTO and see if that is still happening.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1158.412s">And</a> the PTO used to do the yellow dress. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1161.373s">Every</a> other year they would alternate so that kids got different ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1165.775s">So</a> maybe, through you to the superintendent, maybe we should check with some of our PTOs and see what they're funding throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1174.76s">like</a> different programs that we would like to know, you know, because I know the PTO at Medford High, you know, they still do the prom dress shop that was started years ago, like I think we're on the 11th year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1188.446s">And</a> some of the things, but could we check with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1192.168s">To</a> see what the high school is offering with their PTO money, as well as our elementary schools, just to see what they're supplementing for us, so that way at budget time we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1200.972s">Because</a> I did actually get a phone call <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1203.933s">this</a> week about how PTOs are paying for a lot of buses for field trips and about them being able to negotiate pricing for those buses and all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1213.857s">So</a> I was going to actually talk to you about that too. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1216.698s">But</a> we should maybe invite the heads of PTO to one of our meetings and just talk about what they're doing for our school districts so that we're aware of it and how <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1226.878s">We</a> as a district appreciate the work that they're doing and the funds that they're raising, as well as are aware of those programming and let them know how vital we think they are and thank them for their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1238.33s">So</a> if you could add that to the agenda for maybe either the next meeting or the next, I'll give you time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1244.877s">Before</a> the end of the school year, hopefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1248.343s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1613.088s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1613.968s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1615.209s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1616.993s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, I was reading through this report and participation and goals and needs for each of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1624.236s">Some</a> of the schools don't have someone, a parent that stepped up, but we still see needs at all of our schools for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1631.32s">So</a> we need to maybe work with our principals about making this a priority at every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1638.163s">Also,</a> it says near the Robert schools, they've been very excited about this for a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1642.765s">I</a> know that their <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1645.315s">walking</a> school bus, was always a favorite of now Councilor Falco, because he used to go with his family and talk to me about it a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1656.14s">But</a> I noticed that there is still some question about the crossing guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1660.522s">Is</a> there any updates on that at all on the Fellsway?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1681.032s">And</a> through you to the mayor, is there a need for more police officers or someone there in the morning?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1697.558s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1697.878s">That's</a> all we can ask for.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1701.439s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1702.139s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=1706.86s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2301.06s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2302.342s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2304.804s">Do</a> any of the children need medical services that are going on the trip? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2309.95s">And</a> how are we handling that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2311.751s">Maybe</a> through you to the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2371.15s">I</a> just want to make sure that everybody has a reasonable chance to go.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2383.995s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2384.235s">And</a> we just want to prepare for that in case it were to arise, because it would be the school's responsibility to make sure that we provide appropriate health services for any student that chooses to go on one of these trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2396.737s">So</a> I just want to keep that in mind when you're planning, and I applaud you for both doing that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=2437.03s">Defibrillator.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3094.892s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3096.173s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3096.874s">Thank</a> you for your report and thank you very much for the demonstration. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3099.675s">I</a> hadn't seen that so I found it very interesting and your time to come out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3108.762s">I</a> think we need to purchase these immediately if our spring sports are underway and our coaches, like say our track team is doing long distance track or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3120.012s">Those</a> coaches should have them with them and God forbid something happened while we're putting this in the budget for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3127.038s">So</a> through you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent, is there any way that we could find a way to get <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3136.425s">what</a> we need for our students for this spring season to make sure that they're safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3141.487s">And</a> training.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3212.839s">Mayor</a> Burke, I'd like to make a motion to have all of our coaches have these defibrillators with them as of this spring season. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3221.81s">So</a> that way they're portable and our children are always provided safe care. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3227.391s">There's</a> a motion on the floor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3328.679s">It's</a> when, you know, cross-country is running through the fells or whatever.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3336.606s">So</a> we should have at least a half a dozen that they could sign up when they're off campus.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3598.27s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, can we get a follow-up report of how many were actually ordered when they became available to our staff and the total cost after you figure out exactly how much you need? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3609.972s">Could</a> you add that to the requested reports list at the back? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3615.053s">Also,</a> when I read your report, I'm very happy to see that three, four, five, or more people at each of our locations <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3625.01s">trained,</a> except for the Curtis Tough School. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3627.471s">That</a> concerned me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3628.311s">There's</a> only one trained person at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3630.212s">And</a> I know that we're close, and Armstrong can be there in moments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3634.154s">I</a> know we don't live miles and miles away, like some of the rural districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3639.016s">But</a> really, two people minimum should be at every building.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3649.56s">Especially</a> because there's only a nurse there three hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3652.122s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3653.102s">I</a> read another report being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3655.444s">That</a> concerns me, and those students, you know, weren't the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3660.948s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3663.03s">Consideration.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3664.191s">So</a> I'd really like to see an upgraded list after the training, through you to the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3673.68s">any</a> additional people and making sure that we're starting September with the appropriate number at each building and not less than two people at each school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=3684.282s">And</a> I motion to accept the report and thank you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4862.073s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4863.194s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4864.635s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4865.755s">It's</a> very nice to see you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4866.855s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4868.826s">So</a> I had a question about the middle school teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4872.409s">You</a> said the 2.5 people, one for each middle school, would not increase the amount of classes the students take. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4882.317s">It</a> would decrease the class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4885.159s">What</a> is the average class size now? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4887.601s">Around</a> 25, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4888.242s">24</a> to 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4888.742s">In</a> how many classes a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4898.96s">How</a> many classes a day? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4900.161s">Do</a> each teacher currently teach?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=4964.627s">So</a> how would a 0.5 person lower the class size?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5002.121s">So</a> presently, what do we have for staffing at the Andrews for foreign language?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5011.748s">And</a> what's the class size for the Italian classes?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5019.115s">How</a> many of those requested Italians?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5051.818s">I'm</a> just curious just to help how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5055.359s">Because</a> we used to have foreign language every day in the middle schools years ago, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5076.082s">So</a> adding the .5 person, would that enable more children to have <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5082.026s">choice.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5154.344s">So</a> the new hires that you're going to advertise for, will they be for Spanish or for Italian?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5165.701s">So</a> my last question is, do we need two full-time Spanish teachers and a part-time Italian teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5172.803s">Or</a> has that been looked at?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5192.772s">I'm</a> just asking so we allocate and we plan for future choice.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5221.218s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5221.959s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5222.78s">Miss</a> Stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=5225.423s">I</a> can attest to that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6311.348s">Just</a> to follow up on that, I also like it to be here at the chambers, so that way we acknowledge the people that are really doing so much time and service to our community for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6325.376s">So</a> I'd rather really have them present to us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6329.887s">rather</a> than a committee at a regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GnKIPou12eI&t=6332.129s">Yes.</a> <h2><a href="../2017-03-07_J5xdcQvg5bk/2017-03-07_J5xdcQvg5bk.html">Medford School Committee meeting March 6, 2017</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=602.827s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=603.907s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=605.028s">So</a> there was a report requested from the superintendent, so we should add that to list to make sure that we get follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=611.253s">The</a> report of the condition of all the bleachers district wide that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=616.676s">Van</a> de Koot reminded us of at that meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1956.519s">You</a> all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1958.36s">And</a> I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1959.3s">I</a> think the comment at the bottom is an important piece that, um, parents can, but most, most parents know this from being for a while, but it's the younger parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1970.783s">I</a> mean, parents of younger students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1973.194s">that</a> might need that to be listed on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1976.817s">My</a> comment is just November 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1979.379s">It</a> says professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1981.401s">It</a> seems weird to have a day off on a Tuesday and then on a Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1984.704s">I</a> just want people, I understand that, but I'm not sure everybody reading this quickly is going to say, oh, why is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1991.469s">That</a> seems like a strange week to have a Tuesday and a Friday off the same week. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=1995.953s">So,</a> you know, maybe next to it, professional development day. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2001.477s">put</a> also election day or something so parents know that it can't be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2005.639s">It</a> wasn't like a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2006.94s">It's</a> like we do that for the safety of the schools and the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2010.542s">So</a> that way people aren't roaming the buildings on election day.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2200.025s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2204.286s">Also,</a> another point is a lot of school systems around the United States start earlier than we do in New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2211.127s">And</a> all students take the AP exams and the SATs at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2216.869s">So</a> if we're not in school as many days as others, we don't cover as much material as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2223.93s">And</a> they're judged throughout the United States on their performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2228.995s">So</a> we need to be in school a certain amount of days to get the education in for them to be prepared for these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2238.598s">Some</a> schools start early August. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2242.659s">And</a> with our snow days, we could even have weeks less time to prepare for these exams than people in other parts of the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2251.582s">And</a> it's really important to get these days in and the education started for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=2257.295s">So</a> that's another reason why I totally agreed with starting this before Labor Day.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3149.098s">Mrs.</a> DiBenedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3149.778s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3151.839s">So</a> you talked a little bit about school brains and how everybody was trained on school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3156.756s">And</a> my question isn't directed at you, it's really to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3161.46s">I</a> got a note from a parent in the last few weeks about teachers not putting the grades of students into the system so that they could see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3173.069s">So</a> I directed the parent directly to Dr. Perala, who was handling that one situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3179.23s">But</a> overall, could you please check to make sure that throughout the district and provide us with a report as to whether everybody is up and running and posting homework and grades on School Brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3191.696s">And</a> if not, a timeline for everybody to be up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3195.517s">I</a> know we talked about this previously, but I'd like to know if there are any teachers in the district that are struggling that you need to help along this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3203.861s">And</a> if so, how many there are and where they're located. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3206.81s">So</a> I'm requesting a report, um, make it a motion for a report at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3210.692s">I</a> need a second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3244.893s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3245.734s">I</a> just want to follow up with, if one parent calls and there's other parents that are feeling the same way, it just haven't made that call. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3256.84s">I</a> just want to thank you and your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3264.003s">I</a> know you run a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3265.584s">I</a> know your staff has increased in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3269.346s">It</a> sounds like there's more and more programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3271.707s">How</a> are you handling the merger of students with the vocational side as well as the high school side and children going back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3282.262s">Are</a> we sharing some of those students or how are we looking at that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3334.371s">So</a> at a high school level, including the Curtis-Thompson, the vocational school, and the high school, how many students does each guidance Councilor counsel?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3352.718s">So</a> each guidance Councilor is managing 300 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3356.601s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3357.942s">That's</a> a lot.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3367.61s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3368.33s">That's</a> good to know for future staffing levels, if there are increases or different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3375.816s">What</a> about... <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3378.391s">ESL</a> students, do they have a specific guidance Councilor that might help them in a different way, or does the ESL teacher step in at that point? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3387.678s">How</a> is that managed?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3425.733s">And</a> they help them through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3427.435s">Correct,</a> yes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3445.608s">And</a> my final question is about the PSATs. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3449.832s">Now</a> that you've taken it two years, are you seeing an increase in scores on SATs because all students have taken that prep?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3464.224s">Significant.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3488.704s">Well</a> worth the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3489.625s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=3489.965s">It's</a> good to hear that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4376.184s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4376.964s">Um,</a> I remember when my children were picking and when they loved art and music and they couldn't do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4386.806s">And</a> at that point they had to decide whether to do each. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4391.066s">My</a> concern is that with the opportunity to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4395.877s">so</a> many different shops that they could take, that it could hurt our band and our orchestra. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4405.439s">So</a> we just wanna be careful of that and make sure, I know personally that the evening orchestra would still accept students if they were taking band during the day and vice versa, but I'm not sure <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4423.015s">how</a> that's going to affect those groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4424.997s">So</a> could we be careful and mindful of that when sign-ups come?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4444.912s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4445.072s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4446.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4447.093s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4959.422s">Mr.</a> Benedetto and then Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4960.603s">Van</a> der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4961.985s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4962.865s">So</a> I have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4965.168s">I</a> really believe that these should be up at near our fields and somehow some way so people don't have to run back and try to get into the building to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4973.676s">I</a> don't know how, what an appropriate trainer will bring them to the field.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4981.103s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4981.729s">And</a> also a list near every defibrillator, who is trained, like a list of people trained to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4989.032s">So</a> that way, if it's a need, they know who to immediately go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=4993.353s">Because</a> we, and I also would like a list of all school employees, of who has been trained, how many people, where they are located, where they're working. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5006.538s">This</a> is an important thing that could save people's lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5009.46s">And</a> I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5011.055s">We</a> need more information than what's provided.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5030.343s">So</a> I'm making a motion right now, Superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5036.466s">I'm</a> making a motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5040.239s">hopefully</a> second by one of my colleagues, to have a list of all people certified and trained in using this and having it posted next to the defibrillators. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5050.302s">So</a> when an emergency happens, they have the defibrillator and they're like, okay, who knows how to use this? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5055.604s">There's</a> a list of people right then and there and they say, oh, he's on the other side of the field, go get Joe. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5061.786s">And</a> you're not going to the wrong direction to get somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5065.375s">So</a> I think it's imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5066.976s">So</a> I've made the motion, seconded by my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5071.498s">Roll</a> call vote, please.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5456.593s">Oh,</a> thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5457.554s">First</a> of all, I want to thank you for providing us with this report in a timely manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5462.135s">Secondly,</a> I would like you to present it to the City Council as they requested the numbers, and I ask that they get the breakdown as well, so that they can see all the transparency and that where our schools are highly populated in certain areas, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5481.37s">Also,</a> this report will become very handy as well when you provide us the other report on any new developments in the city and where kids are, if the new developments are in the area where our numbers are higher, that will give us some information and some planning for our budget and for our space, because we want to make sure we have enough space for all the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5505.943s">The</a> next thing I wanted to say is, having looked at this report, I'm wondering does this include children that may be in a supported class and come into the regular classroom? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5518.109s">Do</a> the numbers go up during the day?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5538.452s">So</a> not, not most, most generally not for academic classes, but more social classes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5547.035s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5547.635s">I</a> just want to be clear and put it out there because that, you know, that's a question that's always asked.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5573.87s">So</a> my, my other comment is that just looking at this is that the second grade class is, is pretty, it's a pretty big class. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5583.615s">So</a> we want to keep that in mind when, um, the, as they get older. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5588.784s">You</a> know, because that's a large grouping of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5591.726s">You</a> have almost across the board an average of over 22, except for the Brooks School, which is a little bit smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5603.854s">Absolutely.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5666.9s">The</a> only concern I have with that is siblings or, you know, if they've already been in a building for a while and they're comfortable there to at some point switch them because of the number of students in that particular school. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5681.524s">So,</a> I mean, that's not my hope is to have to do that to any family or any students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5703.505s">It</a> just seems like the numbers are somewhat higher than I anticipated for our second and maybe third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5712.029s">Looks</a> a little high in some schools to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5714.931s">And</a> a little bit in fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5716.772s">Just</a> to keep an eye on this, and if more students in that age level come into the district, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5722.336s">We</a> just want to be very, very aware of those class sizes and keep an eye on them throughout the calendar year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5730.44s">So</a> I'm glad that we are now getting this report twice a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5734.402s">I</a> think that was a motion that was passed so that we get it in early September when kids settling in and then again in January so we can keep an eye on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5743.98s">Thank</a> you for the report, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5746.221s">Um,</a> when you present us with the new development report that was requested, could you also include this with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5753.545s">So</a> that way we have both reports together at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5756.787s">I</a> think it would be helpful too. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5758.507s">And</a> thank you for sharing it with the city councils and being so transparent about everything.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5985.883s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5987.344s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5988.285s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5988.965s">Um,</a> under requested reports, um, the quarterly financial report, you said that we would be getting it soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=5997.19s">We</a> voted, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6000.152s">as</a> a committee to get these, um, the community schools financial report on a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6006.015s">And</a> we haven't had one since before last June. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6008.976s">So</a> we're almost a year out, Mr. Superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6065.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6065.593s">Um,</a> I'm just asking for an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6067.134s">I</a> asked for this in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6068.595s">It's</a> two months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6069.715s">Uh,</a> I, you said in a few weeks because the city, the mayor said that the city was done posting what they needed to win the last time I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6079.279s">And</a> now it's been more than a month since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6081.8s">That's</a> the reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6082.841s">And</a> so I am, I am asking for a timeline.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6093.721s">Okay,</a> and I'm asking you, from now to the next meeting, just look at a few of these items and see if you can clear any of them up from the list that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6102.666s">We're</a> working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/J5xdcQvg5bk&t=6103.707s">Okay,</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA/2017-01-24_PVlPxnnlWRA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 23, 2017 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=224.666s">I'd</a> like to make a motion at this point to have the superintendent do a policy and protocol and outline this so that way we have one on for the whole district K through 12 for both out-of-state and in-state travel <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=247.185s">that</a> extends over the school day, like if it's an overnight trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=251.127s">Because</a> we also have to think about in-state. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=253.608s">So</a> this is a major issue, and I really believe that it needs your time and attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=258.39s">So</a> I just would like to make that motion that you provide the school committee with the detailed policy procedure and protocol.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=305.64s">That's</a> why we need it in writing district-wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=308.28s">We</a> need it on our website, so if there's any question, that parents can look at it, and even teachers can look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=314.361s">If</a> they're planning an event or travel with our students, that they can check the policy procedures and guidelines that they need to follow in here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=322.863s">And</a> I also think then we're very clear, who are the decision makers? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=327.204s">Who</a> actually decides whether a nurse is necessary or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=330.644s">Is</a> it the teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=331.504s">Is</a> it the principal? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=332.425s">Is</a> it the nurse at that building? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=333.845s">Or</a> is it the head nurse? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=335.118s">throughout</a> the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=336.039s">It</a> tends to be a combination of a lot of team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=339.564s">A</a> lot of people don't know that and that's why we need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=342.327s">So</a> I'm looking for one of my colleagues to second my motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=757.659s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=758.967s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=759.968s">I</a> really, I have great respect and understanding of what you're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=764.153s">I</a> just don't agree that that's the best way to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=769.439s">I</a> understand you just really don't want to have any child singled out or <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=774.568s">one</a> who's to have to pay more for one child, so that becomes an issue for some people to be able to attend or not attend, which I have great respect for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=784.234s">But</a> I think administratively, it's really difficult to administer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=788.996s">And</a> I really believe that we should take it as it arises. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=793.019s">And</a> if this trip has a child that increases the cost, then it affects that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=798.622s">I</a> don't want to make every trip more expensive so less people go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=802.324s">So</a> I don't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=804.004s">So</a> I just wanted to put my opinion out to the superintendent as he's developing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=809.029s">I</a> think that the way that he had planned is what I agree with.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2204.695s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, I'd like to move the suspension to take the financial report next.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2236.9s">And</a> I'm sorry about last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2240.502s">I'm</a> sorry about last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2243.004s">I'm</a> going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2246.186s">If</a> he doesn't give it to me before I can read it, if he gives it to me that night, I'm always going to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2253.692s">Yeah,</a> I just didn't think.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2964.27s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2964.85s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2965.751s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2969.223s">the</a> piping, it says here that we had sustained extra repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2975.607s">So</a> if we've already had them, how much do we spend on those repairs and how much more do we need to spend? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2981.091s">Let's</a> be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=2981.851s">Let's</a> put the dollar amounts out here.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3042.259s">And</a> you'll be providing us a report?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3049.211s">Do</a> you have a time frame on providing us a report of future expenses regarding?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3056.91s">Okay,</a> and will there be any other expenses in the interim, other than the $25,000 we just spent? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3061.955s">Well,</a> there could be.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3090.647s">So</a> just for clarification, if there is an item that costs a lot of money, if you could put the dollar amount in this report, like the piping, the unexpected piping was approximately $25,000 to repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3104.793s">That's</a> just general information that I'd like it more detailed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3110.69s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3111.811s">Also,</a> as we're talking about schools and maintenance, we had the pleasure of going to an event at the Andrews School, and we noticed that in their gymnasium, their bleachers were broken, and they look somewhat unsafe, and they don't pull them out because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3129.636s">And</a> there were a few other issues in that building as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3132.037s">My</a> colleague was with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3133.177s">Him</a> and I walked through since we were there for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3137.592s">There</a> was some light out in one of the gyms, music room or something, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3144.575s">That</a> had been recently replaced and they still can't seem to get it working and I'm sure we spent a lot of money on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3150.817s">So</a> these are some maintenance items I'd like you to look at.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3156.879s">Also,</a> while we're speaking to that, we did start our tours of the buildings and I would like to, at some point, continue those. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3164.382s">and</a> make time in that a priority with budget time coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3168.083s">We</a> need to see as a committee where we want to focus our maintenance funding, and having our eyes and walking the grounds really makes a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3176.325s">So</a> I'm requesting that that continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3180.186s">And</a> as far as, oh, I'm sorry.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3210.025s">I</a> think throughout the district, the clocks need to be synced at some point or somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3214.647s">Oh</a> yeah, and the school board doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3217.969s">The</a> school board doesn't work at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3220.51s">Just</a> a few things that while we were there, we just happened to notice, and that's why it's important for us to continue that, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3227.993s">My</a> other question regarding the budget was on page two of 13, under permanent part-time <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3235.977s">Medford</a> High School mentors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3238.818s">We</a> budgeted an appropriated $2,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3240.618s">The</a> expenditures have been $34,663.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3263.383s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3264.998s">So</a> there isn't, like, this job created that was spending all this money on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3268.922s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3269.002s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3270.243s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3271.764s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3273.906s">Also,</a> you know, as staffing needs change, if there's any need, any additional staff <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3282.021s">added</a> throughout the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3285.343s">I'd</a> like a list of that in a report with the financial report on the quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3290.926s">Just</a> a list of new people added in their salaries and when they were added and the reasoning for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3297.89s">So</a> that's a request to go along with this financial report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3301.232s">Now,</a> I know this has nothing to do with our new director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3305.535s">It's</a> directly to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3308.777s">I</a> requested and actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3312.788s">The</a> whole school committee voted to have the community schools budget presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3319.072s">We</a> haven't seen one in over seven months, maybe eight or nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3323.854s">I</a> know I requested it, and it was supposed to be here today, and I know there have been a lot of changes both on the city side and the school side, so I have patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3332.58s">I'm</a> trying to be patient, but I'm reminding you I'm expecting it soon, and when it comes,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3340.16s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3385.943s">So</a> this school committee requested it done on a quarterly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3389.087s">So</a> what I would suggest in the future, and this is a suggestion, is that you provide the school part with that disclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3396.676s">And</a> then when we get the state, so we're not waiting eight months before we get a quarterly report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3418.963s">So</a> the last time I requested it, we shot for January, and that was November, early November. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3424.867s">So</a> could I have an approximate date so that way I follow up with you again?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3430.751s">In</a> the next few meetings?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3434.073s">OK,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3446.671s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3447.432s">Also,</a> I just had one more question about the community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3451.737s">I</a> just had a question, are all registrations going through the online programming that we have currently set up, similar to the after school program and all that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3462.812s">We're</a> not collecting checks up in a hallway for people to use our building, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3467.014s">We're</a> actually having people sign up online, and we're renting the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3473.236s">Or</a> they're registering, even if it's free or voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3477.398s">If</a> they're using our building, they're doing the online registration, and we can track who's in and out of our building at all times, because that program was set up last July. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3486.762s">That's</a> a question both to you and the superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3513.196s">No,</a> no, I'm not even talking about the payment piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3515.638s">I</a> want them to register, even if it's a contribution or it's a charity and we're letting them in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3522.802s">I</a> want it so we can say at the end of the year, okay, these are how many hours of charity time we've given. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3529.781s">the</a> McGlynn School Gym or the auditorium up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3534.565s">I</a> want data and be able to ask you and say, OK, how much is the community using this school? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3540.549s">What</a> are we doing with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3541.97s">How</a> much are we making from it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3543.391s">How</a> much money is going back to the maintenance and repair and upgrades or an after school program? <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3548.515s">So</a> we did it mostly to track who's in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3551.998s">And</a> then it's for our own good, too, to know who's in there, because we're responsible for them while they're there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3623.438s">So</a> I'm really happy to hear that, and I encourage even community members that request to use the building and it's donated to them for that time, that it go through the system and we can put a zero payment, so that way we can track who we're donating to as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=3641.462s">Right,</a> no, and I understand that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4348.918s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4349.418s">Thank</a> you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4350.239s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4351.52s">Um,</a> so if we didn't raise our prices, would we still meet the minimum?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4369.326s">My</a> only question reason for that question is I know that we're regulated to charge a certain amount and bring in a certain amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4377.25s">And</a> that's why I asked for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4379.151s">But</a> also I checked online. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4382.573s">I</a> saw the pricing and I really like that you kept it only 25 cents for breakfast increase 25 cents for lunch and 25 cents for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4391.577s">Like</a> just just 25 cents increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4393.878s">It's</a> not a huge amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4395.501s">and</a> it's not three years from now and we're way behind and we have to raise it $2 a meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4402.066s">But</a> I did look on a few of our neighboring communities and how much they're charging. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4408.511s">So</a> Malden currently is charging $1 for breakfast, $2.55 for lunch and $2.78 for the middle high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4417.639s">Somerville</a> has all free breakfast throughout their community and they charge $2.75 for lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4424.553s">Everett</a> is now, there's two prices for breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4428.634s">It's</a> either 125, I think, for the very young grades, and then 150 for the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4434.155s">They're</a> currently at 275 for lunch, same as us, and $3. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4439.816s">So</a> they're exactly where we are right now, and we're in line with a neighboring. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4446.777s">Some</a> of them, these are their prices for next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4449.717s">It's</a> on their websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4451.298s">I</a> did a quick query. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4453.755s">this</a> afternoon to just really compare where we are and where not. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4459.458s">You</a> know, it's always really difficult to raise prices on families because every day when you're packing up $3 for lunch and an extra buck 50 for breakfast, it's a lot to pull out of your wallet every morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4470.565s">And</a> I'm very cautious about doing this, but I want to make sure that, you know, we stay within the federal guidelines and get as much money back to the community to feed all of our students in an appropriate, and we're required to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4484.152s">So,</a> you know, it's a hard call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4486.673s">I</a> mean, $0.25, I think, is very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4490.094s">But</a> at the same time, it's always difficult to raise this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4493.635s">I</a> don't think it is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4579.527s">And,</a> um, the reason I requested it specifically is cause we don't want to pit people very hard, like with a large increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4586.789s">And</a> that's what happened a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4588.93s">when</a> we hadn't been addressed in a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4592.332s">And</a> I'd rather see a consistent review of this program to make sure we're in compliance and to make sure that we're not hitting people's pockets too deeply. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4602.179s">I</a> mean, no matter what you do, I mean, 50 cents a day is still 250 a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/PVlPxnnlWRA&t=4608.404s">And</a> if you have multiple children, it's expensive and it's just not easy today to keep up with everything.<h2><a href="../2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk/2018-01-22_IxvjbChoNJk.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 22, 2017 [Livestream] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=255.333s">I</a> remember recently walking the playgrounds and that some of this preliminary work John might have already done and had ideas for different <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=266.52s">different</a> materials, so it's not a new idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=269.681s">It's</a> something that we know that we're in great need for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=274.003s">And</a> some of the research might have been done, but we need to decide what products are best. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=279.905s">But</a> I believe that we should work with Cheryl to move this forward right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=286.027s">This</a> was on my wish list when I saw. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=289.408s">This</a> thank you for taking it and running with it and making it come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=294.274s">So</a> I would like to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=296.977s">And</a> I'm sure Mr. McLaughlin already has some ideas of where to call and what types of materials people are using.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=954.842s">On</a> this subject, first of all, I think this is great in any way that we can highlight the work that our children in our community does. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=960.727s">I</a> think it's marvelous, especially not only through this, but in general, I think we need to publicize more and more about the great opportunities that children of Method have and the great learning experiences they show our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=977.042s">Based</a> on that, I also wanted to ask you about the new commissioner for DESC, and they finalized the last, down to three.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1051.468s">So</a> in addition to that, any idea of what direction any of these new commissioners are going to go and what required like new.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1066.293s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1067.351s">I</a> just want to keep a close eye on this, and I know that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1071.872s">It's</a> just, you know, when a new commissioner comes in, new regulations, new mandates, different things, and not only do you have to advocate for that, but our next superintendent also has to have the wherewithal to do that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1084.876s">I'll</a> keep you posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1086.996s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1089.237s">Motion</a> to accept report and place on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1872.69s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1874.832s">So</a> going back to the blizzard bags this year, actually, throughout Western Mass, there are a few schools, districts that are piloting blizzard bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1884.92s">And</a> with today's technology, there is a lot of online learning happening, especially for, I believe, our high school students who have AP exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1894.468s">And</a> they take that exam no matter how many blizzard days or how many snow days we take. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1899.312s">They</a> have to have so much curriculum covered by that date, and that's the date everybody in the nation takes that test. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1905.635s">So</a> by losing days for snow, we are behind kids like in Georgia and California that aren't losing that learning time and who actually might start school in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1917.24s">They're</a> at an advantage of some of these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1921.402s">So</a> I believe the future in education is more <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1926.904s">electronic</a> learning, more interactive learning, and I believe our teachers are savvy enough to teach those in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1934.289s">I</a> know that we don't have a per-child device at this point, and I know that our district would love to move forward with that, but that's a very expensive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1944.735s">But</a> if other school, other <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1947.457s">school</a> districts are doing this in learning, and we can see how they're using it effectively for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1954.259s">In</a> Western Mass, there are children that are in all different socioeconomic things, and they don't all have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1960.48s">We</a> can learn from them, and maybe, I brought this up a year or two ago, actually, when we did have a bad winter, about two years ago, when we were going late, late into June, and almost into July. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1974.043s">Might</a> have been three years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=1977.884s">think</a> it is is coming towards method and we have to have an open mind with this and and start looking at it and you know seeing what options are out there and planning for our future rather than wait and see what happens so I don't agree I think that you know we should look forward to this if not for this year and the next year's coming
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2643.385s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2645.166s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2646.727s">Thank</a> you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2647.788s">I</a> think it's a good place to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2652.459s">So</a> in the title of it, recommendation to adopt oversight guidelines for PTO and PTG, I would like to have friends of as well listed, not as under other, but directly PTO, PTG, and friends of groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2671.896s">Because</a> I just want them to realize that they are included in part of this and the oversight will <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2680.723s">Also</a> include them and I would like to add a number nine Register any event that uses our building through community schools So we can track how much our schools are being used in which schools are being used the most so that way we can allocate funding for maintenance and <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2698.25s">and</a> repairs and custodial services and extra paper towels and toilet paper to those buildings and, you know, extra cleaning if that's necessary, and to track where in the city we're using a lot, like, and maybe we need to move it to another side of town so other people in the community can go that don't drive or have an opportunity to attend different things, especially if it's a big event. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=2727.653s">Okay,</a> so those are the type of things I'd like to see added.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3700.823s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3702.564s">Mr.</a> Benedetto on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3704.106s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3705.747s">So</a> on our agenda on the back page, there's a listing of reports that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3711.674s">And</a> if you look under requested reports, the first one was a report on PTOs, including how they're helping the community and what they are working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3719.522s">And</a> that was requested last April, April of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3723.786s">Now,</a> it needs to be amended because when we spoke at our committee meeting recently, the superintendent said that he is planning to have all the PTOs come before the school committee between the month of April and May. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3737.216s">So</a> I would like that amended, that line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3743.12s">And</a> the goal that I had when I requested that last April was to bring the pre-TOs forward to celebrate the things that they have done for the school district and to bring them forward so the rest of the community knows, like, hey, at the McGlynn, this is some of the things they've run, and they've run it for 10 years, and the kids still love it, or, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3765.623s">you</a> know, second graders get to go to the science museum and the PTOs throughout the district have paid for the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3772.725s">Let's</a> celebrate some of these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3774.225s">And</a> that was my goal back in April because I just felt like less people have less time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3780.907s">And</a> they're so involved with trying to get by and things are a little harder for families now or they're busier. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3787.708s">And</a> it was just a way to bring them in to celebrate the work and the time and the effort they did. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3794.19s">My</a> history, <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3795.511s">has</a> been started as a PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3800.051s">president,</a> co-president with Ian Ricucci, who is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3803.372s">And</a> I had a big mouth then, and I wasn't ready to be quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3806.793s">So</a> that's why I ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3808.994s">And</a> I'm here in front of you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3810.694s">And</a> didn't run until my youngest graduated, because I felt like I had a big voice as a parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3815.676s">And</a> you all have a big voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3817.036s">Everybody</a> has a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3818.377s">Show</a> up at these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3819.917s">Say</a> what you need to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3821.118s">Ask</a> us for what you need and what your children need. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3823.658s">That's</a> what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3825.199s">And</a> we need to celebrate the people who have volunteered <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3828.72s">done</a> so much already and before we ask them to do more, we need to show them that we do care and we are here to help support you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3837.005s">So</a> I just want to applaud the people here tonight and encourage more people in the community to come forward and ask the superintendent to amend that piece so that way we do have the PTOs come in April and May of 2018 and we should invite the press. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3855.535s">So</a> that they get a list of all the wonderful things that have been happening, not only this year, but years past as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3860.802s">I</a> think I think it's time to celebrate some of the happenings in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3864.868s">So</a> that's my request, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3866.931s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=3867.332s">Thank</a> you, Miss Wright.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5460.257s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5461.117s">Um</a> on this, I reviewed it and I didn't see a sign off from the school nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5466.341s">So</a> it says the email is attached and the email that it's attached only says please provide me with the list of students so that way I can let you know if there's any medical. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5479.831s">There</a> was no official write off.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5498.871s">Yeah,</a> this is my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5501.475s">With</a> the new paperwork that we just required everybody to fill out is you need a list of students going before you send it out for permission slips so you don't have the list until it's approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5513.892s">So</a> it's like a catch 22.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5520.338s">Right,</a> but the way that the form does, it asks for the list of students when they're filling out the form so that way they can get the approval from the nurse and I think other schools are having this issue as well that I've been told about. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5534.468s">So</a> like you can't, the nurse can't tell you how many children or if any children have any medical issues that a nurse may be necessary or medications may be necessary or delegation of medications may be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5547.001s">So</a> we might need to re-look at this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5550.064s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5551.285s">So</a> we need to change this, and I'd like you to look at that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5555.866s">I</a> know we've talked about it on the phone this week, Superintendent Belson, and so if you, I'm noticing this problem here. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5565.029s">So</a> we need to get initial approvals going, and then provide a list, and then the nurse thing, which is difficult, because then you gotta estimate what the cost of the trip is with or without a nurse.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5603.333s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5604.053s">I</a> agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5604.794s">But</a> just make sure that all policy, everybody approving this and all teachers filling this out know that like it says here that you have to have a nurse's signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5617.3s">And</a> if someone's trying to fill this out correctly, the teacher is going to say, I can't get the signature or curriculum director signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5625.744s">And</a> it only says one is what if it's <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5629.293s">You</a> know, it's getting tricky for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5631.414s">I'm</a> getting phone calls about it, so it's getting tricky for people.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5646.658s">No,</a> no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5647.359s">We'll</a> work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5648.099s">But</a> this is a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5649.439s">I</a> want, if there's a change necessary, because we just approved this, then we need to make those edits and make it easier for our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5656.782s">I'm</a> not trying to make it harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5658.362s">I'm</a> trying to take it down.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/IxvjbChoNJk&t=5675.067s">Yes,</a> of course they can go.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=591.781s">It</a> was a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=592.921s">The</a> superintendent was to draft a policy about outside of school issues and a protocol so that way everybody at every school follows the same protocol. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=603.265s">So</a> if we could add that to the drop-down list so that way we keep track of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=636.188s">I</a> don't know if Chris Kristen had a moment there was just a <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=643.622s">On</a> page three of nine, there was an individual that received two checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=647.123s">One</a> was for $1,000 and one for $800. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=651.564s">And</a> I was just wondering what that service was for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=654.085s">It</a> just seemed like a lot that we don't usually see. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=657.706s">So</a> the name of the person is Valerie DeGeorge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=661.507s">One</a> check on page three, probably the sixth one up from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=667.869s">And</a> then on <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=673.144s">Page</a> six of nine, probably 10 up from the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=678.569s">Two,</a> four, six, eight, oh, 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=681.071s">Yeah,</a> pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=683.372s">So</a> I just didn't know what those services were and if they were ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=687.796s">Sometimes</a> I just like to ask questions so I know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JW2qCmyiOow&t=691.239s">I</a> don't know, the superintendent might recall as well.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=141.431s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=142.912s">I</a> had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=144.033s">Before</a> we incur this cost onto the parents, we need to know what the cost is. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=148.517s">Because</a> I know what we want to do is encourage the most amount of participation in our music programs as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=155.983s">And</a> we don't want to put an undue hardship on anyone who wants to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=160.575s">So</a> I'd like to know how long the sanitation lasts for, like if someone borrows it and then they turn it back in, is it then re-sanitized before the next student were to borrow it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=172.605s">How</a> that works? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=173.626s">Like</a> I really have a lot of questions before we move this forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=203.294s">So</a> it just, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=208.038s">So</a> say I'm a parent and my student wants to play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=211.941s">How</a> many wind instruments do we lend on a year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=248.032s">So</a> they're not borrowed, so they wouldn't come under this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=250.453s">They're</a> rented, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=251.513s">No,</a> they're rented from a private company, but that's not, this wording says borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=257.334s">That's</a> very different, because as a parent, I rented a saxophone for years, and you rent it to own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=263.955s">Actually,</a> my son still has it, and I heard him playing it about a month ago when I pulled up, which I was very happy to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=272.355s">He</a> rented to own this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=273.836s">So</a> when he got it, it was always his. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=276.397s">It</a> actually was sterilized because in the very beginning, Dr. LaPore provided that to everybody in all the Method students when he was first bringing this program forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=286.881s">So</a> it had been sterilized.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=301.712s">So</a> my understanding from reading this, Mr. Belson, was that the school department's inventory of instruments that we were lending out, and I'm like, I didn't know we lent out wind instruments because that's why we had a private company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=316.776s">Wouldn't</a> the private company be responsible for providing clean instruments?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=330.607s">At</a> the cost to the parent to have the sterilization.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=369.456s">So</a> what is the cost incurred by a parent whose child wants to rent an instrument?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=398.155s">So</a> I understand the importance of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=401.396s">So</a> in the health, the health piece and why it's important to have this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=408.92s">Um,</a> so if I had a child who went in the fifth grade and picked a wind instrument, they would pay the a hundred dollars a year to rent to own this instrument until they paid it off typically, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=423.247s">Which,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=424.098s">Our</a> saxophone back then was like seven, $800 total through the lifetime at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=430.621s">And</a> then another $125 for have it sanitized when they initially get sterilized.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=441.627s">So</a> what would this mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=443.108s">Mr.</a> Only we have to inform them that they have the option to or that they have to, there are two elements of the information.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=482.443s">that</a> it's not been sterilized and they have that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=487.207s">And</a> we're by no means mandating this in any way or encouraging it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=491.571s">It's</a> each individual's choice.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1005.5s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1006.581s">So</a> you're saying it's $40 for this?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1016.825s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1018.825s">And</a> it's an option for parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1020.506s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1021.306s">So</a> for health reasons, how often should parents <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1027.468s">get</a> the instruments re-sterilized.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1046.861s">So</a> what happens when you rent to own is you keep that same instrument for seven or eight years and then you own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1054.676s">I'm</a> asking.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1266.289s">Sir,</a> getting back to my question, I just want people to be aware that the recommendation is to have it sterilized every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1274.257s">And</a> rather the first year, you get your instrument from the rental company. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1280.242s">At</a> that point, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1281.628s">If</a> you brought it yourself back to the company to have it sterilized, it would be an additional $40 each year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1294.097s">So</a> then we're putting regulations on our music department that is already working understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1303.82s">to</a> take on this responsibility and I'd like to hear from the superintendent about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1307.684s">I</a> have no problem with this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1310.146s">Of</a> collecting all these 75 instruments, transporting them back to Dr. Lepore's business and having them sterilized.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1364.432s">But</a> if we do that, then we're taking out the option of the parents' choice to have that done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=1369.114s">No,</a> they make that choice.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2252.006s">It</a> seems to me that our community has really, in general, in my understanding of it, meets a lot of these items listed as a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2265.594s">Whereas,</a> I think the program is wonderful and I agree that it should be <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2271.038s">you</a> know, engaged by many of our community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2276.919s">So</a> that way we can have straightforward, honest discussion about any issue that might be the topic at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2284.481s">And</a> I do encourage people to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2287.662s">I</a> just don't know why it goes from a method conversations to a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2294.253s">Because</a> I really feel that our community is very open and welcoming already without putting it forward in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2301.456s">So</a> I just didn't, I just didn't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2318.822s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2319.482s">I,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2320.589s">I</a> see that, but I feel like our community already does that in so many ways on a daily basis.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2412.878s">So</a> my only point was to say that I feel our schools district already does an exceptional job of making all our students feel welcome.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2424.58s">I</a> agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2425.68s">That's</a> why I just wanted to say that I didn't want people to hear this and think that we have to make a resolution for these things to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2432.402s">This</a> happens on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2435.001s">by</a> the educators, our administrators, by our community, and by everybody here that we really care and we look at children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2443.35s">That's</a> children that we educate all and we support all in any needs that they need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=2448.796s">So</a> that was my concern.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4016.756s">I'm</a> really happy to see this, Beverly. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4018.516s">I</a> know that I've talked about this for a long time and having options for children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4024.273s">I</a> also want to look at this for children that might be having some issues that they couldn't feel comfortable attending school and how we can help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4033.961s">So</a> this, I think, is the first step for helping children that are really having a difficult time walking into the building and how we can possibly build on this so that way all our children have the right to still be able to, whether it's a physical or emotional, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4052.436s">any</a> type of issue that they can't get to school that we could use more and more of this to make sure that we're addressing those needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4060.082s">And</a> I think this is a big step towards that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4076.974s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4677.454s">So</a> from what I'm hearing is that we have a program that addresses an issue at the high school, but we're seeing that issue at our middle school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4686.541s">So</a> let's take the curriculum that we're using at the high school, check it to make sure it's developmentally appropriate for our middle schoolers, since we're hearing that middle schoolers are engaging in this, and bring that down to them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4712.007s">I'm</a> hearing that middle school students are discussing this issue, so the fact that they're talking about it <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4721.247s">means</a> that we should talk about it with them and discuss it in an open, caring manner so that they can talk about their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4729.714s">Even</a> if it never happened to them, if they're talking about that this is going on, we need to have that conversation before it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4737.601s">And</a> not wait until high school for this particular piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4740.964s">So</a> we're being informed by a parent that this topic is in need. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4745.712s">at</a> an earlier time, so I would like for, through you, Mr. Belson, to make a decision to bring this topic, if it's provided at the high school, to have our people, Diane or whomever, needs to look at it and make sure it's appropriate to start bringing that content down into our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4765.942s">Because</a> children are starting these more mature conversations much earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4771.644s">And</a> if we're not addressing them until after they've already heard about it, talked about it with other children, we're not helping them learn open communication and how to deal with it and all of the things we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4785.688s">We</a> don't want to miss the boat and talk to them about things that they've already dealt with. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4790.259s">two,</a> three years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4791.22s">We</a> want to get them when they need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4792.681s">Just</a> like D.A.R.E. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4793.382s">is</a> at fifth grade level because that's the appropriate time to speak with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4797.546s">And</a> it might have been seventh grade level at some point and moved down because children are more mature in some topics now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4815.684s">maybe</a> at our next policy meeting that we discuss a policy procedure for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4823.249s">I</a> don't know exactly when we're having any policy reviews.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4921.367s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4923.348s">I</a> wasn't quite, I wasn't quite done. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4925.169s">Um,</a> so at this point I'd like to, um, make a motion that we discuss putting a protocol in place for, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4934.789s">Situations</a> that happen outside of school that teachers hear about what they should do if this information were to come to them, like some school-wide policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4945.535s">If</a> I was a teacher of a sixth grader and someone said, this student over here's picture has been put over everybody's cell phone, and I learned of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4958.308s">I</a> would know, because there would be a policy in place, that I need to report it to the guidance office as well as the assistant principal, and the assistant principal would then, you know, follow up or whatever that policy would be that we think is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4972.478s">So</a> I would like the superintendent to put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4975.641s">I'm</a> making a motion that he comes up with a policy and procedures for situations like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=4983.046s">I</a> need a second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5005.931s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5009.005s">Motion</a> to accept the report.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5402.49s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, through you to the superintendent, I know a few years ago we went up on our school lunch prices because we needed to upgrade equipment and make sure that we were adequately, I just really would <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5417.716s">I</a> would ask you to look at that and to see if we're going to raise prices again. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5423.898s">We</a> want to give parents in the community enough information early rather than have a vote of a big lump sum because it is a hardship for some families. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5433.081s">And</a> I don't want our children to show up at any level, high school or young, without enough money for school lunches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5442.752s">really</a> communicate well about this and come forthright rather than at the last minute, the end of the school year for the beginning of next year and parents don't hear it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5503.491s">So</a> in history, what they do is they make due for a very long time, and then they come to us and they need a big increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5510.494s">And</a> I think when we spoke to them last time that happened, we told them to come forward ahead of time for maintenance and for new machinery as we go, rather than to wait for a last minute and have a huge price increase to our parents and our students, because some of our students who work <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5527.99s">and</a> pay for their own lunches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5529.511s">And</a> I know that they're hungry sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5532.213s">A</a> lot of our students can come to school hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5534.834s">And</a> some people, that's the only meals they get. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5537.336s">So</a> I just want you to be very conscious of it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5572.556s">And</a> what about our high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5573.636s">Are</a> we getting those forms back from our high school students so that they qualify?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5609.641s">A</a> motion to accept the grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5611.063s">Is</a> there a second?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5663.455s">And</a> also, excuse me, I hope you don't mind my comment, parents don't sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5669.104s">realize</a> that when you qualify for free and reduced lunch, you also get discounted amounts on college applications and SAT exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5679.911s">So</a> it really is more than just the food program. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5683.152s">And</a> I don't think that that's communicated well to most parents in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5688.175s">So</a> even if they say, well, my kid's never going to get a school lunch and they're going to bring their lunch, there's no reason for me to fill out that form. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5694.659s">There</a> are children that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5696.359s">they</a> get vouchers for SATs, and they get decreased applications for colleges, and they're getting very expensive now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5705.183s">So,</a> I mean, there's a lot of good reasons to get that out, so I hope that our high school is communicating that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5711.887s">I</a> know I've spoke to that point before, that maybe Dr. Perella, when he sends out the form, also advises parents that they qualify for those other things, as well as just lunches, and that, <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5725.55s">Because</a> a lot of people just have no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5727.632s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xBvw3Ocvd1c&t=5728.773s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE/2016-11-23_iQlaYxPzzdE.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 21, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=764.175s">OK,</a> and did you open that up to the vocational and Curtis Tough students as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=770.476s">OK,</a> 20 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=772.317s">And</a> you'll have enough chaperones, I'm assuming? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=775.635s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=776.575s">And</a> what grade levels?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=793.843s">Yeah,</a> I think those are two different groups of different abilities.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1885.509s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1886.31s">Through</a> you, Madam Mayor Burke, to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1892.937s">Mr.</a> Belson, can we send a letter to all the veterans and <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1896.537s">with</a> our appreciation.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1924.036s">And</a> I had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman who stormed the beach at Normandy this Veterans Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1930.44s">And</a> boy, it's amazing some of the stories that these people have. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1934.803s">I'm</a> very grateful for the years of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1936.745s">And</a> I'm very grateful that they share their experiences with our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1941.227s">Could</a> you please tell Mr. Kane how happy we are that he and you run Anne Bernadette? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1947.156s">run</a> such a great program for our students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=1954.138s">That</a> interactive learning and learning across age is really something that kids, students remember forever.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2895.203s">I</a> know I'm pushy and I ask for this report and I also ask how much we pay on this conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2901.529s">I</a> also have great respect for it for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2904.772s">I</a> know that a lot of the money that came into our school department for our science labs came from your team attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2915.617s">at</a> the conference, because Mr. Belson came back from one of the conference with this idea and about the grant, and he was on fire to make sure that that happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2925.241s">And</a> I know that we have our science labs because of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2928.162s">So</a> I do see value in it, but also as my job, I need to make sure that we're using funds appropriately, and that's why I always ask how much we pay for it, how many people are going, is it of value, <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2942.278s">What</a> is the money actually paying for? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2944.159s">Are</a> the right people going? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2945.86s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're just straight out and honest and communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2951.303s">We</a> do pay, we do spend $3,500 to send people to this conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2956.706s">And</a> I trust in the administrative team's judgment that this is necessary and helpful for our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2964.09s">And</a> I do believe that the $13 or $14 million we spent on our labs, <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2970.898s">som</a> var 60 procent funderad av federal government, var på grund av den här konferensen. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2975.202s">Am</a> I correct, Mr. Belson? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2977.063s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2977.844s">What</a> did you bring back this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=2979.085s">What</a> are the big things?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3082.558s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3083.439s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3496.757s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3499.478s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3500.419s">You</a> mentioned school brains and how you got to speak to the vendor when you're down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3504.734s">I</a> just wanted, not directly to you, but to the superintendent, an update to make sure we're still on track and how it's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3512.578s">Just</a> a quick update. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3513.759s">I</a> know it's not on the agenda, but since you mentioned it, it doesn't hurt to ask.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3530.456s">And</a> are all the teachers now trained in up and using school brains?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3564.4s">And</a> parents on ready to be put online?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3585.791s">What</a> about the elementary schools, Mr.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3602.658s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3603.398s">Some</a> parents have asked me in the recent past, so I thought I'd just ask since someone mentioned it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3676.097s">What</a> about homework? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3678.148s">My</a> teacher is posting homework.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3713.301s">I</a> also want to thank you for taking this on and helping our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3718.542s">It</a> was important. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=3719.443s">Yes,</a> it is very important, and your time and expertise is appreciated.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4232.837s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4234.178s">I'd</a> want to see any such letter before we approve the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4238.579s">I'd</a> want to see a draft of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4311.734s">Great</a> job. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4314.492s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4316.093s">When</a> I was reading through some of this, the student group that really stood out to me is High Needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4323.695s">And</a> what is exactly the definition of High Needs in this?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4361.871s">So</a> I really feel like this data is extremely helpful in supporting our children that are having disciplinary issues and identifying the first step <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4373.177s">for</a> helping them. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4374.678s">So</a> I'm glad that you're going to look at this data a little more closely, and whatever plans you come up with, I'd really like a report back on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4405.331s">My</a> experience working within schools is that a lot of disciplinary issues are based on either social emotional or the fact that they're struggling academically and they would rather act out in a behavioral way rather than have their peers or even their teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4424.527s">lose</a> respect for their abilities or, you know, they just want to stay in control and that's how they act out so that nobody sees that they're struggling academically. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=4435.091s">So</a> identifying those students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5241.091s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5241.551s">Mr.</a> Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5243.711s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5244.771s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5245.372s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5247.412s">So,</a> did this report go through the State Ethics Commission? <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5250.713s">Because</a> that was what was requested at the time that the report was asked for.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5282.678s">I</a> didn't know they wanted- No, it was to get an opinion from the State Ethics Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5287.359s">That</a> was what was requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5289.799s">But</a> I have no problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5292.34s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're open and honest with all dealings, with any businesses that are also renting our community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5300.329s">and</a> that it's out there so that there is no impression by anyone in our community that anything is other than forthright. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5312.533s">And</a> that's really the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5318.235s">Because</a> I have great respect for the people that work in our community, but we just need to make sure everybody in our community understands where we stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5326.598s">We're</a> open and honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5327.519s">Yes,</a> we run this international college school in our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5331.84s">Some</a> of our administrators and some of our teachers are employed there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5335.822s">We</a> are well aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5337.282s">They</a> only work for them at those hours and not during school hours, that we're renting them at the same rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5345.045s">and</a> time and usage as we rent to other people just because our employees are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5350.17s">There's</a> no deals given. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5351.471s">I</a> just want it to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5354.534s">Like</a> honestly, that's what I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5356.496s">Communication,</a> transparency, and putting it all on the table so that there's no little innuendos or questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5364.603s">And</a> if they are asked, we can stand up here and answer them directly and honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5369.088s">That's</a> the intent of requesting this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5372.469s">And</a> I know sometimes it seems like there's more behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5376.01s">There</a> really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5378.01s">So</a> given this, are we charging them the exact rate or we're charging other people that are using the same time and amount of our facility?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5417.441s">So</a> in your opinion, the people that work for this program, <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5424.296s">It's</a> not interfering with their day job, and their day job is not interfering.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5441.587s">And</a> it's not just teaching, it's administrating, too, as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5467.132s">So</a> I feel like the intent of my request has been fulfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/iQlaYxPzzdE&t=5472.854s">So</a> thank you for the report and thank you for your time, Mr. Greenspan.<h2><a href="../2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo/2016-11-10_FmrA4M646Vo.html">Medford School Committee meeting November 7, 2016</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1804.605s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1805.586s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1806.106s">Thank</a> you for the report, and I apologize for coming in late that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1809.967s">So</a> I missed a little bit about the MCAS scores for math in ELA. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1817.579s">for</a> our 10th graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1819.04s">Do</a> we do a comparison from this year to the last few years? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1824.586s">Do</a> we get a graph of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1825.927s">Because</a> I didn't get it that evening and I don't see it tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1829.07s">Mr.</a> Superintendent?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1859.151s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1859.811s">Also,</a> do you have weekend? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1862.032s">Okay,</a> we show the graph for the high school and the junior high for the last few years of MCAS for 10th and 8th and 4th grade.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1875.196s">I</a> see some is if the high school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1878.658s">Okay,</a> great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1880.348s">Yes,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1881.309s">I</a> just didn't see it when I was looking through it and I was late that evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1884.712s">Again,</a> I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1886.453s">Also,</a> the district comparison, I know you'll need some time to get that to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1891.397s">Could</a> you add that to the list of outstanding items on our agenda so that way within the next few meetings you'd be able to until that's covered?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1904.303s">Okay,</a> so just add it to our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1907.287s">Yes,</a> 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1908.388s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1925.105s">Mayor</a> Burke, can I say one more thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1926.645s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1927.626s">So</a> my understanding, Mr. Superintendent, is that we are now a level 2 school district.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1934.269s">So</a> I was the one that yelled quite a few times that when we were level 3, so I would like to congratulate everybody who worked so hard last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1942.692s">to</a> move us back to the level two district. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1945.294s">That's</a> a great accomplishment for everybody that works in this community and for our students as well as our parents and the children that also have really tried hard on these exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1957.342s">So</a> we are a level two district. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1959.544s">I'd</a> like everybody to know we are now a level, and I'm very proud to say that and very happy to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1964.727s">And</a> I would probably say it all year, just like I said, I was worried when we were level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1969.41s">I'm</a> glad to see us moving in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1972.013s">Great</a> work. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=1972.633s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3281.651s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3283.072s">Thank</a> you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3284.152s">It's</a> always very informative, very quick, a lot of information, and I learn a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3291.635s">I</a> also agree that we need to have a subcommittee meeting, so at this point, I'm making a motion to move this item to subcommittee, to committee of the whole, rather, sorry, committee of the whole within the next two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3307.181s">Is</a> that too soon? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3308.322s">Two</a> months?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3332.934s">So,</a> can we put within the next two months, Mr. Superintendent?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3337.958s">Sooner</a> than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3339.659s">Okay,</a> so my motion is on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=3341.461s">It</a> needs a second.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4971.135s">We're</a> going to wish it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4973.136s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4975.478s">So</a> this is a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4977.7s">I</a> know a few years ago I brought it up when we had so many snow days, that there's other ways to learn and teach our students in a lot of other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4986.086s">They</a> either have a snow day backpack where students complete some work so they don't fall behind, <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4992.09s">Well,</a> this is an opportunity to look at online learning for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=4997.133s">And,</a> you know, we live in the Northeast, but we still take AP classes on the same day as everybody else in the country, no matter how many snow days we have and how many we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5007.44s">So</a> the learning has to be done in some classes by a specific date. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5012.405s">So</a> I would really, really like to talk to you at some point about more online learning opportunities for our students and to have us present maybe to the state different ways for children to study from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5028.435s">That</a> being said, Mr. Belson, you know how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5032.417s">I</a> like to see our buildings open even for any kids that come, even if it's less teachers, even if it's anything because some kids don't have a warm house. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5041.798s">to</a> stay in all day or parental supervision. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5044.761s">And</a> some kids depend on our schools to have their breakfast and their lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5049.465s">And</a> they really shouldn't be home alone all that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5052.708s">So</a> any opportunity that you can, I'm going to ask you to please try to keep some of our school buildings open for those families that really need us to be there for them on an everyday basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5063.838s">So</a> that's how I feel, even though I hate driving in the snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5068.388s">Good</a> luck making that call, and I'm glad it's not me making that decision.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5753.47s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5754.23s">First</a> of all, I feel like I work at a charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5758.772s">I</a> believe my school does adhere to all these rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5762.573s">But</a> as an employee of that school district, I choose to abstain from voting at this time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=5780.078s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6196.419s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, two updates from the super.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6265.202s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6266.483s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6268.504s">Superintendent,</a> through you to Superintendent Bellson, he gave us two updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6272.926s">I</a> don't know if you wanted to go over them publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6276.188s">One</a> was for the complete rollout of school brains and when that will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6285.753s">Mr.</a> Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6287.294s">And</a> the other one is the MBTA bus passes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6448.862s">Mr.</a> Benedetto has a question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6451.603s">Mr.</a> Superintendent, I'm wondering if you could maybe work up a timeline in the next month or so, so that way parents know or tell us how you're going to communicate to parents when the rollout for the Parent Portal piece will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6464.828s">I've</a> been getting a few phone calls and messages from parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6468.809s">They're</a> eager to use this program and they were really looking for a specific date.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6524.492s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6526.173s">So</a> even if we put it up on our website that we're working <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6530.37s">coming</a> soon, approximate, hopeful dates, whatever way you want to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6535.472s">At</a> least so parents have an understanding of what they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6540.493s">I</a> have experienced school districts turning over, and I really know that this takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6546.055s">And</a> some school districts don't even turn it over till the parents leave first or second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6550.657s">They</a> wait until all think glitches are out. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6554.338s">So</a> I understand that you are trying to expedite this quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6558.37s">And</a> I do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6559.891s">Also,</a> would you just put that on our agenda that, you know, just to update us on the dates? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6567.336s">If</a> you could do that, I would appreciate that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6914.116s">First</a> of all, I want to say thank you for helping the parents that came forward about the MBTA passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6919.341s">When</a> I reached out to them, they were very happy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6922.818s">administration</a> and how they resolved their issues and how they opened it up to people in need of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6929.002s">And</a> if other people are in need, then they should contact, I'm not exactly sure.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6956.934s">So</a> my last item is a few items in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6960.276s">They're</a> just items that I would like to see listed under number 11 that reports we've requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6967.902s">And</a> as they're requested, we take them off the list and it helps me <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6972.432s">It's</a> like my to-do list, and I go from meeting to meeting and rewrite the list, so it's just helpful to have it on the bottom there. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6981.376s">Someone</a> very smart suggested I do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6983.717s">Anyway,</a> the first one would be the letter to Rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6987.239s">Donato</a> and Gobley regarding the crossing guard at Salem Street and asking them to help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6993.702s">I</a> mean, Fellsway, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6995.663s">The</a> other one would be the cost report of all <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=6999.78s">expenses</a> for the MASC conference from last year and projected costs for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7007.764s">And</a> there was a couple of items my colleague, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7013.966s">Kreatz,</a> requested, and that would be to add a bus to go from the elementary school to the high school for the field trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7029.77s">Oh,</a> okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7031.271s">I</a> thought it was Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7031.971s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7032.211s">Sorry,</a> it might have been Anne-Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7036.492s">In</a> the update on the MCAS, students that did not pass MCAS in adding a prep class, if that's been added... We've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7048.197s">Okay,</a> that's good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7049.657s">I</a> know that that question came up last time about how we were going to provide extra additional help and where that money was coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7058.4s">to</a> help students that have to retake the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7061.321s">So</a> I know that that came up at our last meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7064.581s">So</a> that has been done, and that class is scheduled. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7066.962s">Yeah,</a> we'll get you a report on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7069.642s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7070.142s">It</a> helps me keep everything straight, and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7073.063s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/uB3sO1jLVHw&t=7073.523s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1745.945s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1750.228s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1751.688s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1752.749s">Um,</a> I'm actually a safety care trainer as well because, um, at my school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1757.792s">So</a> I know a lot of it is deescalation in removing the audience or the other children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1765.336s">So</a> that way they aren't traumatized as well as the person who was acting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1769.745s">So,</a> and I know that Medford Public Schools uses that, and I'm sure that they had the children move, but I'm sure, as you stated, that your child probably witnessed stuff that made them nervous and anxious and a little afraid to go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1786.454s">So,</a> I know that in this report it says more intensive incidences were not witnessed, but <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1794.622s">That's</a> out of an adult's view of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1798.765s">And</a> each individual adult will deal with different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1803.408s">And</a> it will affect them differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1806.209s">And</a> the same thing happens to children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1808.151s">So</a> we're hearing from parents that their child was affected by situations happening in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1816.036s">So</a> those parents, one, have to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1818.605s">Two,</a> have to have counseling services to make sure that they feel safe coming back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1823.869s">And</a> I'm glad that both those things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1826.391s">The</a> main issue I have, and I had this issue before this incident arose, was the number of students in the classes at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1834.057s">We</a> talked about this when we got the graph. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1836.379s">And</a> it's not about the type of children, it's a high number for elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1842.283s">And</a> I felt, I mean, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1845.606s">The</a> Roberts School, sorry I misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1847.765s">but</a> the Robert schools numbers were much, well not, they were higher than any other elementary school when I looked at this and I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1855.227s">At</a> that point, it was the only school that had 24 students in any class. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1859.248s">And</a> I understand that some had 21 because of how Mr. Johnson, which I know why and how he does his class allocations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1869.55s">And</a> I agree with how he does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1872.411s">Our</a> job here, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1874.808s">is</a> really to make sure we're prepared to meet the needs of all the children in our care. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1882.291s">That</a> means all the children, children with disabilities, any child that walks through any classroom door, it's our responsibility that they are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1891.175s">That's</a> first, that's last, that's always. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1893.556s">We're</a> here to educate them, but we have to do that in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1896.898s">And</a> I believe that a lower class size might help to ensure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1901.951s">So</a> I'm gonna ask the superintendent to look at that again, not at this moment, but I want him to go back with his team and really look at what's happening in this school and the population of the needs of the children within this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1915.36s">And</a> just look at it with clear eyes and observation and really see if this, the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1923.102s">Is</a> the programming specific for the special education students at that school? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1929.366s">I</a> know at different schools they have different populations of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1933.428s">Is</a> there a specific population of students directed towards the Roberts? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1938.071s">I</a> know the ELL students are there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1997.64s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=1998.28s">I</a> think that's great, but I would really rather be proactive than reactive, especially in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2005.485s">So,</a> um, even a meeting a night with the superintendent to the school or to the children affected or whoever needs to be there may be warranted just to, to come and tell them what our plans are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2018.187s">So</a> make sure that everybody is on the same page and that they're notified face to face and parents have a chance to voice any and all concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2026.229s">I</a> think hearing them might help us to develop what's best going to work because they're the ones who are dropping off their children and not care every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2035.272s">Um,</a> so, um, are there a greater number of calls for safety care team at one school more so than another? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2046.297s">Do</a> we have those stats?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2055.061s">Just,</a> just the information so we can decide whether we need to put more funding, more staff, what we need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2062.784s">I'm</a> not trying to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2065.682s">know</a> specifics about students, but we need to know specifics about programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2071.107s">And</a> if we're allocating enough staff and money to a situation and really don't want to go away from here and then something else happened, if that's even more involved or any, you know, situation, because we didn't act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2088.108s">So</a> with that in mind, I'm asking the superintendent at this point to look at the class sizes again at the Brooks and the staffing and I mean the Columbus, the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2098.556s">Sorry,</a> I'm having one of those nights at the Roberts and really look at it with an objective eye and keeping in mind the needs of the students in the population of the students, not only their, their, um, all their needs, you know, 51%, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2119.132s">low</a> income, how many ELL students and, you know, special needs are in each room. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2126.297s">I</a> really want to see that information looked at, you know, with an objective eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2130.96s">And</a> I'm sure you've looked at it once, but I'm asking you to look at it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2134.102s">I</a> want to ensure the safety of all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2137.084s">And</a> if things need to be shifted, let's not do it because that's where we've always done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2141.647s">Let's</a> do what's right and move things or fix things or add another class or decrease the size for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2148.572s">If</a> we're seeing, you know, there are trends, just like with PARC or MCAS, you see one class does a little bit below one year, you look in the next year and see if they're doing a little bit below the next year, well maybe that class needs a little more academic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2163.755s">So</a> maybe this class needs a little bit more hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2167.636s">We</a> need to look at trends and see if it will happen last year, if it's happening again this year, and look for those patterns so we can meet the needs of these students <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2176.196s">in</a> the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2177.557s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2178.758s">Mr.</a> Skerry.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2665.288s">Final</a> comments, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2666.848s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=2667.368s">I</a> want to second all the motions except for mine and move forward to put them on record.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3288.516s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3291.25s">Mister</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3292.191s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3293.191s">And</a> I'm really glad that this is in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3295.033s">This</a> is perfect timing, especially with the events that happened recently, um, and that we're going to put, um, um, some issues in some corrections in place immediately and not wait for this to be completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3310.384s">That</a> was a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3312.625s">Um,</a> so with this brought up, <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3315.697s">a</a> memory of an update, I need an update from the crossing guard on the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3320.859s">Did</a> we ever, you know, figure that out with?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3354.471s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3355.051s">Because</a> we've been trying for that crossing guard for about a year now, and we've been asking about updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3360.393s">I</a> know we've reached out to the DCR repeatedly, and that we really weren't getting anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3365.793s">before</a> something happens there, I would like that addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3368.555s">And</a> I'm glad that Rep Donato will be handling that because I think he'll do an excellent job and look forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3375.559s">Superintendent,</a> could you please give us an update at our next meeting on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3379.822s">So</a> I'm making a motion to have a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/3G6bVVGWEWQ&t=3382.603s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=407.375s">Koretz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=408.676s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=410.545s">So</a> at that time, we visited the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=413.986s">And</a> I was wondering if we had any dates set to visit any of the other schools.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1750.049s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1751.67s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1753.07s">I'm</a> actually a safety care trainer as well at my school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1757.772s">So</a> I know a lot of it is de-escalation in removing the audience or the other children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1765.323s">So</a> that way they aren't traumatized as well as the person who is acting out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1771.186s">And</a> I know that Medford Public Schools uses that, and I'm sure that they had the children move. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1776.569s">But</a> I'm sure, as you stated, that your child probably witnessed stuff that made them nervous and anxious and a little afraid to go back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1786.454s">So</a> I know that in this report it says more intensive incidences were not witnessed, but <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1794.622s">That's</a> out of an adult's view of what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1798.744s">And</a> each individual adult will deal with different situations, and it will affect them differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1806.188s">And</a> the same thing happens to children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1808.149s">So</a> we're hearing from parents that their child was affected by situations happening in their classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1816.033s">So</a> those parents, one, have to be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1818.614s">Two,</a> have to have counseling services to make sure that they feel safe coming back to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1823.873s">And</a> I'm glad that both those things are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1826.375s">The</a> main issue I have, and I had this issue before this incident arose, was the number of students in the classes at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1834.04s">We</a> talked about this when we got the graph. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1836.362s">And</a> it's not about the type of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1838.624s">It's</a> a high number for elementary school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1842.266s">And</a> I felt, I mean, I'm sorry, the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1846.65s">Sorry,</a> misspoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1847.765s">But</a> the Roberts School's numbers were much, well not, they were higher than any other elementary school when I looked at this and I brought it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1855.228s">At</a> that point, it was the only school that had 24 students in any class. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1859.23s">And</a> I understand that some had 21 because of how Mr. Johnson, which I know why and how he does his class allocations, and I agree with how he does it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1872.396s">Our</a> job here, <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1874.808s">is</a> really to make sure we're prepared to meet the needs of all the children in our care. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1882.272s">That</a> means all the children, children with disabilities, any child that walks through any classroom door, it's our responsibility that they are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1891.177s">That's</a> first, that's last, that's always. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1893.539s">We're</a> here to educate them, but we have to do that in a safe manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1896.88s">And</a> I believe that a lower class size might help to ensure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1901.934s">So</a> I'm gonna ask the superintendent to look at that again, not at this moment, but I want him to go back with his team and really look at what's happening in this school and the population of the needs of the children within this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1915.345s">And</a> just look at it with clear eyes and observation and really see if this, is the programming specific for the special education students at that school? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1927.115s">Is</a> there a type, you know, like I know at, <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1930.658s">different</a> schools, they have different populations of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1933.4s">Is</a> there a specific population of students directed towards the Roberts? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1938.062s">I</a> know the ELL students are there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=1997.614s">Okay,</a> I think that's great, but I would really rather be proactive than reactive, especially in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2005.479s">So</a> even a meeting, a night with the superintendent to the school or to the children affected or whoever needs to be there may be warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2014.639s">just</a> to come and tell them what our plans are, so make sure that everybody is on the same page, and that they're notified face to face, and parents have a chance to voice any and all concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2026.229s">I</a> think hearing them might help us to develop what's best going to work, because they're the ones who are dropping off their children in our care every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2036.335s">So,</a> are there a greater number of calls for safety care team at one school more so than another? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2046.278s">Do</a> we have those stats? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2050.159s">There</a> is, but not this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2052.259s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2055.44s">Just</a> the information so we can decide whether we need to put more funding, more staff, what we need to do, that I'm not trying to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2065.665s">know</a> specifics about students, but we need to know specifics about programs and if we're allocating enough staff and money to a situation and really don't want to go away from here and then something else happen that's even more involved or any, you know, situation because we didn't act. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2088.108s">So</a> with that in mind, I'm asking the superintendent at this point to look at the class sizes again at the Brooks and the staffing, I mean the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2098.551s">Sorry,</a> I'm having one of those nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2100.431s">At</a> the Roberts and really look at it with an objective eye and keeping in mind the needs of the students and the population of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2109.074s">Not</a> only their, all their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2114.435s">You</a> know, 51% <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2119.132s">low</a> income, how many ELL students and special needs are in each room. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2126.277s">I</a> really want to see that information looked at with an objective eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2130.961s">And</a> I'm sure you've looked at it once, but I'm asking you to look at it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2134.083s">I</a> want to ensure the safety of all the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2137.066s">And</a> if things need to be shifted, let's not do it because that's where we've always done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2141.649s">Let's</a> do what's right and move things or fix things or add another class or decrease the size for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2148.552s">If</a> we're seeing, you know, there are trends, just like with PARC or MCAS, you see one class does a little bit below one year, you look in the next year and see if they're doing a little bit below the next year, well maybe that class needs a little more academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2163.735s">So</a> maybe this class needs a little bit more hands-on. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2167.636s">We</a> need to look at trends and see if it will happen last year, if it's happening again this year, and look for those patterns so we can meet the needs of these students <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2176.199s">in</a> the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2177.56s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=2178.74s">Mr.</a> Scurry, Madam Mayor.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3354.443s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3355.024s">Because</a> we've been trying for that crossing guard for about a year now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3358.647s">We've</a> been asking about updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3360.348s">I</a> know we've reached out to the DCR repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3363.225s">and</a> that we really weren't getting anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3364.886s">So</a> before something happens there, I would like that addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3368.509s">And</a> I'm glad that Rep Donato will be handling that because I think he'll do an excellent job and look forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3375.514s">Superintendent,</a> could you please give us an update at our next meeting on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3379.777s">So</a> I'm making a motion to have a report. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3383.438s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=3430.496s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4452.704s">I</a> have a few questions from the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4457.825s">My</a> first is, are the children told that the outcome may not be confidential before they begin? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4466.048s">They</a> will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4471.237s">Are</a> we sending the opt-out form to parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4474.88s">Are</a> we sending them a form if you don't want your child to?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4497.872s">or</a> a phone number for parents that don't have easy access.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4502.353s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4503.173s">And</a> then my last question is about staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4506.994s">So</a> our nursing department is really going to be taking care of this, and I know our nurses work extremely hard already, and this is a new initiative for them to undertake.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4579.845s">So</a> my request is that you track that and how many. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4583.968s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4585.049s">How</a> much coverage one nurse is taking on and the increase in incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4590.513s">So</a> we make sure that we're covered well because we have a lot of students with a lot of different needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4596.017s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4597.038s">So</a> I want to make sure that all students are safe while we're planning to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4600.961s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=4601.961s">Mrs.</a> Cugno.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5368.965s">Any</a> other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5370.765s">I</a> have a few questions, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5372.746s">I</a> compared the goals of what you met, what your goals were for last year and what this year's goals were. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5379.528s">I'm</a> very happy to say you met a tremendous amount of the goals that you set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5383.949s">There</a> is a few areas that <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5386.453s">You</a> either didn't meet them as of yet, or you re, you alternated them with other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5394.936s">And</a> if something isn't working, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5396.836s">I</a> was very happy to see that you took that initiative and moved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5403.458s">There</a> was one on SMART goal, district priority goal two from last year, number three. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5412.081s">No,</a> not number three, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5419.107s">Number</a> two, alternative direction for the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5423.571s">You</a> have the minimum of 10% of educators in each school work with central administration in planning and preparing professional development programs for mass social and emotional curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5433.679s">And</a> you went the alternative direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5435.36s">I</a> didn't see that in the next, this year's goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5440.745s">Did</a> I just miss that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5563.442s">Okay,</a> that totally equals that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5568.026s">So</a> on the next page, District Priority Goal 4, Section 3, it's stated by the end of 15-16, the district will have fully developed two common assessments per client and <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5585.129s">And</a> it says approach the goal for how we've met. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5590.494s">Common</a> assessments have been developing in most of the areas, the grade level areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5595.7s">And</a> we're in the process of finalizing assessments for hospital grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5602.047s">So</a> I just want to know if those assessments will <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5606.05s">judge</a> the programs that we purchased, like the journeys and the math program? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5613.772s">Will</a> it evaluate how far we've come because we purchased them? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5618.014s">And</a> I'd like to see some of that data.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5686.02s">So</a> I would like to know, as a committee member, <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5701.422s">you</a> know, the progress and growth we've made because of that purchase and how it's worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5706.325s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5706.805s">So</a> it's different from this?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5725.055s">So</a> I'd like to make a motion at this time that through the superintendent we have a report of <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5730.807s">these</a> programs and how well our children, how we're performing either way, with the value of those programs and how it's helped our children throughout that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5744.233s">You</a> know what I mean?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5775.75s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5776.31s">So</a> we will get that when we get our results, which are due, which were released at 5 o'clock.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5786.097s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5786.537s">So</a> moving forward to next year's goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5791.422s">I</a> had a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5794.624s">So</a> at least you know when you do a report that I actually read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5798.067s">I</a> do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5800.248s">I</a> know we all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5802.97s">District</a> four priority goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5805.632s">I</a> just thought that there could be another goal on the district's mock goals to increase our citywide level <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5818.757s">which</a> I'm hoping we have good news this evening about anyway, in rating, to move to make all schools a level one. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5829.04s">Could</a> that be added there? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5831.401s">Like</a> a goal for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5834.682s">And</a> I just thought that that was the right place for that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5917.406s">Just</a> on the next goal, priority goal five, item three. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5924.775s">There</a> is not a percentage listed as there was in the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5929.339s">So</a> by June 2017, each school will implement a positive behavior intervention plan to promote learning and respectful interactions as evidenced by a reduction in student suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5942.489s">Last</a> year's goal had a percentage of 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5946.812s">I'd</a> like to have a goal for people to hit, like a number, so it's quantifiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=5953.554s">Right?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6047.873s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6049.033s">I</a> just saw that in the previous year, and I was just curious why we weren't... More of a refinement.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6084.988s">And</a> my last one is district priority six. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6090.231s">Number</a> two, educators deemed unsatisfactory are needing improvement in standards one and or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6098.084s">on</a> their formative or summative evaluation will participate in professional development offerings. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6104.289s">Contractually,</a> is that possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6106.531s">Like,</a> can we require that? <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6108.513s">Because</a> I read from previous, the explanation from previous year that you couldn't do that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6221.986s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6222.506s">Thank</a> you for the explanations.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6226.667s">I</a> can just kind of summarize
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6748.697s">Motion</a> on the floor to accept, report accepted and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6753.02s">So</a> moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/9tYE20_LxA4&t=6759.675s">Everybody</a> who agrees say aye.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1242.232s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1244.656s">My</a> question is, students that leave the classroom, is there any additional children on top of the 20, 21, 24 coming into the classroom for other subject matters, or is that the maximum that's in that classroom at any time during the day?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1281.626s">Could</a> it happen like if a child that has special needs though comes in for English and math and science, but not English and social studies, so it could bump up those numbers even higher?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1300.861s">What</a> about the ESL students?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1303.51s">Så</a> det är inte... De kan samlas för en generell aktivitet, men inte generellt för reglerna.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1309.834s">Vi</a> använder full-time-aids baserat på de antal vi har, inte på de större antal. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1332.218s">This</a> is still concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1333.879s">I</a> mean, it's better because we do have the full-time aides, but the full-time aides were to help the number we already had in existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1342.125s">And</a> kindergartners need a lot of extra time and help from adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1346.428s">I'm</a> just putting it out there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1419.368s">One</a> more question, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1420.789s">Okay,</a> so I'm looking at the middle school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1423.472s">The</a> Andrews has a sixth grade entrance of 178, and the McGlen has 148. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1429.296s">I</a> know we had a big difference at the beginning of sixth grade last year, and that looks more even now as I look at the seventh grade numbers, but there's 30 more children at one than the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1445.829s">I</a> thought we were hoping to keep them somewhat equal.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=1499.756s">–Jag</a> vill, men jag vill vara försiktig, så att vi inte gå ner i vägen
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3093.846s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3095.908s">I</a> just want to say we added a lot of new technology and labs at our high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3101.154s">Do</a> we have enough equipment and materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3104.257s">Because</a> I know the materials go quickly in those labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3108.782s">I</a> just want to make sure that they have the actual enough supplies.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3189.067s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3189.387s">Even</a> in the chemistry classes and all chemistry?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3441.773s">Would</a> you like to speak, Mr. Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3443.074s">Yes,</a> please. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3444.895s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3446.075s">Diane,</a> I just have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3447.876s">My</a> first idea was to ask Carmack Health if they'd come down and train both the before school and after school CPR and first aid, since it's so generous with us in every other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3459.24s">and</a> they just declared this evening how they wanna be a big part of the community, that that's a good way to get our people trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3468.006s">Thank</a> you, that's a great idea, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3469.947s">Also,</a> my other question was about a wait list, so thank you for filling in that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3474.85s">Is</a> this program self-subsidized? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3480.194s">Does</a> it pay for itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3481.575s">It</a> does pay for itself, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3483.256s">Does</a> it generate an income?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3487.799s">It</a> does?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3499.607s">That's</a> my next question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3518.195s">I</a> also had another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3519.597s">Are</a> we noticing any parents that are dropping children off early but not enrolling them in the program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3568.643s">Okay,</a> that's really my major concern and that's why I asked about whether there's income and space <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3574.477s">for</a> those parents and if we were reaching out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3577.559s">I</a> think, you know, as the darkness gets darker earlier in the morning, my concern is that and as it gets colder, I just don't want children waiting outside of any school. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3588.446s">So</a> I'm really glad that these programs are run and that there are adults there that are aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3593.889s">I</a> think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3595.13s">I</a> think the information is great and how you roll it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3598.192s">I</a> really appreciate this program and what it's doing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3603.135s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=3603.936s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4895.767s">It's</a> not in regard to this, but I wanted to ask Pat while she's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4900.692s">I</a> know transportation has been happening throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4903.414s">Is</a> it okay if I ask that at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4905.335s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4906.516s">So</a> I just like, I know that there was a little update on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=4910.179s">I</a> just wanted to hear from you like how things are going and if our homeless students all have rights to school at this point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5002.59s">Okay,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5003.75s">I</a> just want to make sure that every child's able to attend no matter where they might be sheltered. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5011.112s">Especially</a> if they lose their homes, they really need their school and their community and that stability in their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5016.735s">So</a> that's why I always ask that at the beginning of the year, just to make sure that I know it's much more complicated and much more expensive than people think. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5027.179s">And</a> it's just so important and it touches my heart when we can't get a child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5033.602s">So</a> that's why I ask that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5035.783s">And</a> I'll keep asking you over the next few weeks that as soon as everybody has arrived <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5040.057s">Please</a> just let me know and I'll just let you know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5047.763s">And</a> I know we do, and it is a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5050.265s">Sometimes</a> it takes, you know, a month into school to make sure that every child has arrived in different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5057.991s">So</a> and I want to say thank you to you, because this is a big undertaking at the beginning of the year, as well as getting us informed about all the budgetary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5067.739s">And</a> I appreciate that effort on <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5070.355s">on</a> the behalf of all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5071.897s">All</a> of our administrators do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5074.139s">I</a> mean, getting up and running isn't an easy task. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5077.363s">And</a> then, you know, you have to look at us and have our reports ready.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5083.134s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/P8GypPJIZKM&t=5084.415s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1126.097s">And</a> so my next priority down there is that room with the kitchen in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1130.179s">I'd</a> like to go down and visit that maybe in the next week or two if the superintendent has time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1135.862s">maybe</a> we can coordinate it so we can both be there at the same time, as well as the principal and the special education director.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1159.218s">So</a> if we can look at something like that so it could be done over a long vacation or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1163.621s">But</a> if we stop planning now, we might be able to do that throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1167.324s">I'd</a> really love to see that continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1169.966s">It's</a> a valuable property that the department owns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1173.749s">And</a> I know that the children there really benefit from having that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1178.233s">So</a> I just want to say thank you for not forgetting about it.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1333.351s">I</a> think we especially noticed it in the cafeterias?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1346.844s">Was</a> it the Columbus as well that had some missing?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1361.387s">I</a> know your list is very long, but it's just something that we remembered. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1365.129s">That's</a> fine.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1613.264s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1615.186s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1616.867s">On</a> the school committee meetings, I noticed that we have a meeting and it's listed December 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1622.713s">That's</a> a Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1623.874s">I</a> was wondering if that was a typo and possibly meant to be the 19th.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1633.863s">That's</a> quite all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1635.324s">Also</a> in your opening enrollment in our schools, that section of your beginning... Well, you know, it's still early because people have been coming in and, you know, until we actually see them arrive.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1652.1s">Will</a> we have an updated calendar?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1670.308s">Also,</a> I was wondering, and I know I asked for a lot of data, because it helps me understand what's going on in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1676.452s">The</a> other piece is an update of the number of students attending before and after school, and how many staff members there are, and if there's a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1684.978s">So</a> that way we can see where needs are in the future and just make adjustments throughout.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1710.703s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1711.443s">I</a> know these fluid documents, and they'll change throughout the whole month of September, but it's just good to have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1717.765s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1719.065s">And</a> if I see parents along the way, and they say, oh, I want to get into a morning program, I'll say, oh, it's almost full, so make your calls quickly, or it might be full. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1729.308s">It's</a> good to have that knowledge.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1731.149s">To</a> be able to pass along throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1733.71s">Also,</a> we can see which areas we might have to switch staff to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1739.454s">If</a> they're willing to do that, who knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=1742.175s">I</a> know hiring people for those positions is difficult.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2670.653s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2671.673s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2672.974s">As</a> I sit here and look at this list and then look around this room, there is something obvious missing from this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2682.138s">The</a> libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2683.538s">So</a> I encourage everybody to look around and request that the Method High School library upgrade be added to this list.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2695.424s">There's</a> a parent I'd like to speak to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=2752.889s">So</a> until that happens, Mr. Superintendent, can we add that to this list, please?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3207.873s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3208.594s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that we move this to a committee of the whole with site meetings.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3785.741s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3786.841s">Hi,</a> welcome to Matt Finney. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3791.235s">Oh,</a> some of my questions have already come forward, like how would you disagree with the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3796.918s">He's</a> very strong and he knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3798.519s">But</a> you would also learn a lot from him because he has a long history of knowledge and of the community as well as this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3807.324s">And</a> he works very closely with this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3811.167s">So</a> in the last year and a half that Pat's been here, I don't even know how long exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3818.026s">Two</a> years, two months, three months? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3821.549s">Really</a> feels like a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3822.73s">But</a> Pat was really able to streamline a lot of our payment structures from community schools to after school programs to the lunch program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3836.541s">Do</a> you have experience in some of the systems that she just newly put in place?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3902.32s">And</a> another thing I noticed by watching Pat in the last few years is that she works closely with the finance department of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3912.27s">And</a> do you have any experience with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3914.332s">Am</a> I correct in assuming that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3916.214s">That</a> is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3917.635s">And</a> do you have any experience with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3919.577s">I</a> know with regional schools, I'm sure you've worked with multiple cities.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3958.785s">And</a> I know our specific city was looking at changing some of the way the budget is and maybe even a new program, I don't know if it's citywide or schoolwide, so we can see more details of a budget and I'm hoping that you, rather than going to a journal entry to understand <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3980.144s">like</a> an item on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=3983.226s">Have</a> you worked with that type of system and any experience rolling like it over with the city at the same time?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4034.01s">through</a> each line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4035.65s">Because</a> at times I'm very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4037.731s">If</a> there's a big line item for our thing, I'm like, well, what did we buy with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4041.432s">Or</a> what did we spend on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4043.052s">And</a> then the way it is now, we have to look at journal entries to find out the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4047.873s">And</a> it's a lot that I end up not pushing further. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4051.794s">But</a> if it's differently handled, then I might ask for those type of, I like a lot of data.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4099.706s">I</a> don't know if it's on the city's capital plan, I'm hoping, but... It is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=4980.211s">Thank</a> you, Superintendent.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5027.723s">And</a> so you have eight people that do all of that work combined with yourselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5035.507s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5037.748s">And</a> in your office, like your immediate office, how many? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5041.97s">There</a> are three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5045.912s">And</a> does your office also do accounts receivable and accounts payable as well?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5063.136s">I</a> actually work at a school, so I'm aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5069.298s">So</a> how many years of experience do you have supervising that many people?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5123.363s">So</a> we're transferring a lot of our payments, like, for example, our lunch program was upgraded a few years ago, and that's going smoothly, and people can pay online now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5137.292s">Now,</a> we're recently doing community schools and rentals of our buildings, and we're switching that over. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5144.582s">Getting</a> the word out to people and making sure that follow-up is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5150.065s">I'm</a> sure we'll get an update of how that conversion went very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5156.589s">That's</a> just how I hinted what I like to have, just so you get used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5166.414s">Sometimes</a> this doesn't go easily, and people don't realize it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5170.196s">A</a> mindset's been a certain way for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5174.709s">And</a> some people don't like to change quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5178.511s">So</a> how would you address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5181.712s">And</a> how would you handle community pushback?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5696.593s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5697.254s">Any</a> other commissioners?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5843.285s">Hi,</a> welcome to Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5844.486s">I'm</a> Erin. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5845.147s">Nice</a> to meet you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5849.391s">So,</a> have you worked directly in a school district?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5915.346s">And</a> you feel like the switch from the city side to the school side, you'd have the skills in?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5992.367s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=5992.687s">How</a> many people do you currently supervise?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6014.218s">And</a> I just have, do you still do any accounting work privately, like, because you had your own business? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6021.319s">Very</a> little.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=6025.22s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7303.156s">Older</a> and better, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7792.59s">Hi,</a> I'm Erin. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7795.331s">Could</a> you tell me how many people you currently supervise? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7798.972s">Let's</a> see, I have
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7836.769s">So,</a> Pat's just spent a lot of time since she's been here, a little more than two years, two years, two months, and how many hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7847.475s">really</a> updating a lot of our systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7850.936s">So</a> like our community schools program is now online, so when people want to use any of our buildings, they have to go through that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7859.72s">And</a> are you familiar with some of the programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7862.941s">I'm</a> sure you've talked to her about what we're currently using.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/gUPvnttl-cs&t=7936.078s">So</a> do you present the budget to the superintendent or at the school committee meetings or whatever?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo/2025-03-21_FZrFYASlUZo.html">Medford, MA School Committee - June 20, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1032.876s">Thank</a> you for your work on this, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1036.61s">So</a> my first question is the price for Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1040.452s">I</a> want to make sure that, you know, the $145 is the lowest of the prices that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1046.214s">And</a> if it's going across the board, that means for-profit and non-profit will be paying that amount, unless they apply for that $75 if they don't need any other facility use. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1059.159s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1059.839s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1060.779s">So</a> I'm just concerned because- Excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1065.585s">If</a> we're still required to pay for the bond and the bond interest in future years, I just want to make sure that we have the funds if we're supposed to be able to do that from this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1077.849s">I</a> want to be very clear that we're going to raise enough money to be able to do that and not have a shortage and have to go into our general school club accounts or the city's general account to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1091.64s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1106.907s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1107.467s">Um,</a> I have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1108.928s">I</a> hope it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1110.349s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1111.269s">So</a> that was my first question just to make sure that one 45 is, is what other communities are paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1118.652s">My</a> second one is, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1121.065s">Up</a> above, where it says, Groups Grandfathered, Method Youth Soccer, and Method Lacrosse. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1127.631s">So</a> we need to have on file a copy of their 5013C. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1131.834s">So</a> we have record that they are a non-profit?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1136.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1136.878s">And</a> I'm really happy to see this, because these groups have been using our fields for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1142.783s">And</a> I'm wondering how delegation of field time is going to be handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1148.766s">I'll</a> let Mr. Maloney answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1150.388s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1151.149s">I</a> know that when we built the Field of Dreams or Edgeley Field, it was prioritized that non-profits that took care of the youth in our community were to get first usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1165.327s">And</a> then, out to the highest bidder after that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1167.968s">And</a> I don't know if that's... That's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1170.468s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1172.108s">High</a> school first, of course.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1250.008s">I</a> spoke with the president of Method Youth Soccer earlier this year, and they had stated that they requested 12 hours on the turf fields and got six this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1261.397s">A</a> week, not total.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1264.139s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1264.879s">They</a> got more than that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1301.479s">And</a> I just didn't know if they had no other availability.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1315.544s">Well,</a> with the new computer system, we'll be able to see who's on our fields, and maybe the city side will get it for the parks, so that way we know, and we can look, like, okay, so you need some more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1327.812s">Well,</a> the city has time, and here's what's available for you to use that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1332.214s">It</a> might be helpful on both ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1334.416s">Thank</a> you for that clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1336.959s">So</a> my next question, and you might want to just hang around, Bob, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1341.98s">So</a> the registered Method Public Schools Booster organizations shall be allowed available times, otherwise not booked, which is great, at the gymnasium and at elderly field. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1356.044s">I</a> just want to make sure that these Booster clubs are also non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1360.005s">They</a> have to have their non-profit status filed with our offices in order to get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1366.39s">I</a> know some are and some aren't, and this will encourage them all to become non-profit in that way there. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1372.791s">It</a> protects them in the school district at the same time, and that's my goal here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1378.973s">So</a> if they don't have non-profit, at least if they filed the papers and they can prove that, if they're planning on using it soon, I'd like that paperwork in City Hall and give them a deadline of like September 15th or whatever you think is fair, October 1st, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1397.127s">But</a> we should come up with a date for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1399.868s">And</a> if they're not nonprofit, we're going to have to say, I'm sorry, you need to become that in order to use our field. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1406.452s">So</a> I would like that added in to the wording of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1410.534s">Also,</a> with their filings of their papers, I would like to know who's in charge of those nonprofits, their names, and contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1419.957s">So</a> that way if there's ever an issue, say something goes haywire on the field and some damage happens, we don't have to search for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1427.983s">That's</a> also in our database. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1435.049s">But</a> sometimes there's multiple people, so like if, like on their non-profit things, like, yeah.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1452.2s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1453.361s">I</a> think that's a great idea as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1457.683s">And</a> the Hormel decision should also ensure Edgley field rates if we're providing enough notice for current renters. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1466.369s">So</a> are we already? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1467.71s">Is</a> that what Hormel's already charging? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1470.191s">I</a> don't know if you know that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1480.022s">In</a> the real cost.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1491.568s">So</a> we're gonna be getting quarterly reports on this, so we can look at this to see if this rate is great enough for us to- Should we just go ahead? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1506.323s">if</a> this is great enough for us to pay our bond and pay the bills on the upkeep of the fields and the equipment that we're using, and see then if any changes are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1518.533s">So</a> I thank you for all your work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1520.795s">If</a> you could add those things in, Pat, I make a motion to pass if those things are added in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1527.861s">Ms.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1843.045s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1844.526s">Today</a> I had the opportunity to look at the summer rec program that City Hall put out and I noticed that Mary Judd has her summer swim camps on there, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1858.79s">But</a> I know there are other camps. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1860.43s">I</a> know there's a soccer camp and I know that there's probably a lot of other things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1866.815s">I</a> would really like that to be added on an annual basis to that book, so that way everybody in the community sees everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1874.201s">Even</a> if it says, you know, the football camp is practicing here on three nights, it's only open to Medford High students. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1883.888s">You</a> know, at least then, people in the city are seeing all the great things that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1888.852s">But,</a> like, I know that that soccer camp, my kids went to it when they were young. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1895.325s">all</a> the way through it, and it's not on there, and it would be good publicity for that group to bring in those funds to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1903.407s">So</a> if there's a way before that's printed, if the... Right, I know it is for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1911.369s">I'm</a> making... Right, and then parents would really have options and really can see everything going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1919.051s">Because</a> we have so many programs that we should be yelling it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1928.673s">With</a> changes to the wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1933.855s">Adding</a> that non-profit and that the booster clubs and names of contact and offices among those groups.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=1943.358s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2590.66s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2592.061s">First</a> of all, I just want to say thank you for putting this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2595.102s">It's</a> very well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2596.803s">It's</a> a good basic base. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2599.444s">It's</a> not, you know, it's not specific to what we want to do as a school committee, but it at least has something in place if something were to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2607.508s">And</a> I think that's what the community came forward asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2610.529s">And</a> I think that we fulfilled that with this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2613.15s">So</a> I wanted to say thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2615.051s">I</a> think there's some more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2616.552s">And</a> maybe at the beginning of next year, we should sit down and really <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2620.178s">You</a> know, in case things were to arise, have more specific what we as a committee see what our steps would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2627.725s">So</a> we don't even have to think about it in case of any emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2631.588s">So</a> I want to thank you for putting this together so well. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2635.671s">Secondly</a> is, I also, for just information, when I was at a class at MASC with my colleagues, we did, down the hall, was a class on how to pick a superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2647.61s">So</a> maybe it's a good idea if some of us were to take that class, so that way in the future we have some knowledge moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2656.536s">It</a> doesn't have to be all of us, but it might be a great idea for us to have for future knowledge in case an emergency or a different situation were to arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2667.824s">So</a> I'd like to see when they're offering that, and if any members or any of my colleagues would like to join me in taking that class.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2797.675s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2798.275s">Um,</a> so I think that's, that's a really good idea, Mr. Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2802.796s">So</a> what I would like to do since I'm the chair of the personnel subcommittee, I'd like to put it on the schedule for, um, late September and, um, call a meeting, a subcommittee meeting to go over this and to, to put, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2819.239s">those</a> ideas together and so that way it doesn't get lost.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2834.09s">Or</a> we can do it this summer either if people are around. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=2850.852s">Aye.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3100.928s">I</a> know over the years since I've been elected, we haven't had summer meetings, but if if we don't have another meeting from now, our next meeting isn't planned for late <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3112.884s">Like</a> September 20-something, am I correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3119.89s">Right,</a> but that's almost a three-month span. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3123.073s">July,</a> August, two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3126.056s">Yeah,</a> it's two.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3133.613s">I</a> always felt like that we should meet before the opening of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3138.176s">That's</a> just my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3139.477s">I've</a> always felt that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3141.319s">School</a> opens without us meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3145.302s">It</a> just never made me feel comfortable. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3147.163s">And</a> all business is just done without an email to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3152.347s">And</a> I just have some concerns with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3154.188s">I</a> really think that the opening of schools, I mean, we should meet before, make sure things are on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3160.581s">plan</a> for September, make sure the coaches' meetings and the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3163.663s">And</a> if parents have questions or concerns over the summer, they can come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3168.707s">We</a> can discuss it before school's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3171.669s">There's</a> a lot of things like school placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3174.51s">There</a> could be questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3175.651s">There's</a> a lot of things that could arise over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=3178.613s">And</a> I just think it's a long span without meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4521.92s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4522.861s">I</a> have a few questions, so if someone has a question before me, I'm willing to yield to them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4533.405s">Okay,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4534.826s">I</a> just want to be respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4537.647s">So</a> going through the actual budget book and some of these changes, I just want to go over <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4544.677s">that</a> what I wrote down is what we got and what cuts we had to make, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4549.22s">Just</a> so I'm clear on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4551.682s">So</a> as far as added personnel, we added 1.5 ELL teachers, one math teacher at the high school vocational school sharing it, an adjustment Councilor, a high school English teacher, a behaviorist, and I'd like to know what their credentials are. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4569.193s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4569.973s">I</a> don't know what a behavioralist is compared to an ABA. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4573.935s">I</a> don't know the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4574.735s">All</a> right.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4626.488s">Will</a> that person's salary have to change once they?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4638.095s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4640.177s">So</a> we added the behavioralist. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4642.018s">We</a> also added kindergarten needs to the Robins, from part-time to full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4647.901s">A</a> librarian for our middle schools and a math coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4650.987s">which</a> is a lot of additions to the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4655.61s">And</a> from all the changes, I think that, I don't know if I missed anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4661.394s">So</a> cuts that I'm aware of, things that are not in the budget any longer are two secretarial positions, three Paris-fed positions, one teacher at the Curtis, one teacher at the Roberts because of class sizes, one high school opportunities for change person, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4679.748s">a</a> teacher at the McGlynn Literacy Coach for grade K. Is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4686.41s">You</a> just let Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4686.97s">Corino</a> address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4687.95s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4688.17s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4694.092s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4694.192s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4694.272s">No,</a> I don't think I had that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4696.532s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4699.233s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4700.413s">I</a> just want to make sure I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4702.194s">I</a> like lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4703.734s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4703.854s">OK,</a> so that's my first thing, just to go over what we've had and what we haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4707.544s">So</a> secondly, I want to thank you for going back and looking at your budget more closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4712.085s">Like</a> I asked you to the other night and to really change things around and try to fit some of the needs that we heard the other evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4720.366s">So</a> I appreciate the effort that you made to do that and bring us forward more things that this committee felt were very important in our priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4729.208s">So,</a> so, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm grateful for you doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4734.618s">So</a> I want everything and a little bit more.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4739.04s">That</a> you just gave me and a little bit more, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4741.461s">Surprise.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4748.564s">So</a> I just wanted to let you know that I'm a little surprised about the principal at the McGlynn not needing that literacy, that person, because she said it was extremely important to her the other evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4764.44s">So</a> I was surprised to read this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4766.041s">I</a> believe her. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4766.882s">There's</a> a letter in here from her. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4768.603s">But</a> if we see throughout the year that that need is great, I would like you to keep your eyes on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4775.347s">Because</a> I know you do that throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4777.268s">So</a> that's my first request. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4780.41s">And</a> reevaluate if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4782.192s">And</a> move staff if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4783.753s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4784.473s">Reevaluate</a> and move staff if that becomes necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4789.336s">So</a> I also received, as my colleagues did, an email from the Columbus <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4793.883s">school</a> teachers about the need of full-time kindergarten aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4800.347s">Now,</a> I know you've given us some this year, and we're making progress, but throughout this district, the needs of students coming in to kindergarten, and I see this not only in our district, but in the districts that I visit and the district that I work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4815.778s">A</a> lot of children come in with a lot of needs, and as a school committee member, I'm gonna tell you directly, like I have many, many times, <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4823.857s">I</a> want full-time aides in our kindergartens. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4826.878s">I</a> know that it's not in this year's budget, and I know that you can't afford to do it, especially with the revenue for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4832.779s">But</a> I'm letting you know for next year, Mr. Bellson, what I would like to see in your budget, the first thing I want to hear is when you walk in the door, is that we are going to go district-wide with full-time kindergarten aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4846.143s">So</a> that's my second comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4847.703s">But</a> thank you for the ones at the Roberts for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4852.045s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4854.143s">So</a> I'm thrilled to see the librarian, because the librarians, like I kept saying the other night, first cut, last reinstated. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4862.41s">So</a> thank you for listening and hearing on that matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4865.272s">And</a> I would love to see her reaction when she found out that this was being added to her staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4874.479s">Has</a> someone told her?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4882.105s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4883.207s">You</a> know, if someone could take that picture, I would really like to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4888.69s">So</a> that's another thing that I really want to talk to you about and thank you for. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4894.932s">So</a> as far as the clerical assignments, you know, we cut a lot in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4903.636s">They're</a> really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4904.617s">They</a> work very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4906.257s">I</a> think cuts are just making more people work harder for the same money. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4912.39s">So</a> I really have a problem cutting these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4917.851s">I</a> think they're vital to our school community, and they're the first people that our parents reach out to before they come to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=4924.972s">So</a> with that said, I'm wondering if, since you weren't able to change the PR person, if any of those duties or some of those duties can be reassigned, because if that person has time to help out that department, I would like to see that happen.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5056.103s">So,</a> if I could continue if that's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5059.425s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5060.986s">So,</a> I really appreciate the things you gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5064.309s">I</a> know that PR person, and you and I don't agree on this, she's given years of service to our community and she's done excellent work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5072.134s">And</a> I really appreciate her years of service and all the things she's done in our community, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5082.177s">The</a> cost is very expensive in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5085.499s">And</a> I'm going to reiterate it like I did the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5087.86s">With</a> all due respect to the person in the job, I wonder if we could not get an intern or have it handled in a different way and free up this person to do some other vital work. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5099.306s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5100.507s">But</a> this is an expense that I don't think our schools really should be allocating funds towards just this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5107.091s">And</a> it's a lot of money in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5111.271s">I</a> have to voice what I think is right and that's what I'm doing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5239.189s">Can</a> I follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5241.731s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5242.491s">So</a> maybe the city council needs her help and we could split it among the city and the school department and have one PR person for both <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5250.035s">Maybe</a> that's something we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5251.715s">Oh,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5254.776s">He</a> just gave me the idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5255.856s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5257.576s">So</a> just to finish, I had some specific questions about budget, but I'm taking a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5262.737s">So</a> if someone wanted to jump in with their questions, I'll ask them at the end.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=5390.057s">I</a> will, and I'll come back because I don't want to.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6157.369s">Sorry,</a> guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6159.87s">So</a> I have some specific questions from my budget book.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6165.12s">OK,</a> so mostly under the grant section.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6169.322s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6170.322s">So</a> I noticed that you have a health services nurse under a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6175.605s">And</a> I know because I administer the MassHealth program at another district that if the nurse's salary is under a grant, then it's hard to bill MassHealth for service time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6189.353s">So</a> I was just wondering why a nurse's salary would be under that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6212.86s">So</a> you can bill MassHealth for the portions?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6219.761s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6220.502s">Just</a> checking on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6222.895s">And</a> secondly is I see that there is a listing under grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6229.977s">So</a> what brought it to my attention is that there is a library meteor instructional teacher position under library meteor and they have a salary of $97,136. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6239.861s">And</a> then when you look under grants, it's under TriTech. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6247.928s">And</a> I won't say the position's name, but there's another salary allocated for $17,682. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6255.354s">So</a> if you would combine the two, that person would make $114,828. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6259.317s">So</a> let me explain it so we can go right through it for you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6298.698s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6299.198s">So</a> could you, I don't, I don't understand why we have a line item that says tri-tech because I thought tri-tech was a nonprofit entity, not through the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6310.322s">So</a> I was just surprised to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6312.243s">And</a> I might be dissed that I don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6314.684s">So</a> that's why I'm bringing it up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6383.577s">I</a> just wanted to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6384.917s">So</a> she's the executive director of Tritech and also an employee of the Method Public.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6411.7s">So</a> the other school departments that are part of TriTech are also paying a portion of her salary?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6430.225s">And</a> then does she get two paychecks? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6432.185s">Because</a> I didn't believe that you could have two paychecks through the school district.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6479.763s">There's</a> also another position that that's allocated the tri-tech then as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6485.205s">In</a> the one right above it that says, um, director teacher.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6495.155s">It's</a> $64,296. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6495.635s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6522.289s">How</a> much do we get from that grant?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6572.122s">No,</a> up in the front under the administrative section, I think he's talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6576.103s">Excuse</a> me.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6588.218s">So</a> could we see a breakdown of the TRI grant at some point? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6592.64s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6593.761s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6595.362s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6596.002s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6596.422s">I'm</a> just trying to learn as I go, because when I see something, I have to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6600.644s">No</a> problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6602.145s">So</a> that's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6603.586s">And</a> I know I keep asking this. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6610.328s">is</a> will there be any surpluses at the end of this budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6614.871s">And</a> if so, when will we get notification of how they'll be of all accounts? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6619.915s">I</a> mean, community schools, everything, all accounts, because this is, and I also would like to, at this point, sorry, to make a motion that when we get our budget book next year, that all accounts that the school committee's responsible for overseeing be presented at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6635.948s">So</a> that way we have everything at once, and it's clear to see it all.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6654.252s">That's</a> what I'm asking, just so that way I can see all entities at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6658.374s">And</a> when we vote for the budget, we have all those things, the most updated information so we can vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6665.258s">That's</a> all I'm changing is, you know, maybe we can arrange it so the quarterly report falls at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6672.601s">But</a> I'd like to see the after school, the lunch program, all of the programs that I was listing before. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6677.564s">Anything</a> that the school committee oversees at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6680.772s">Any</a> money's going in or out, and any accounts that could have a deficit or a surplus, we should know at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6687.156s">That's</a> all. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6687.636s">I</a> just would like it in that format. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6689.717s">So</a> I'm making a motion for that to happen, and I'm hoping that one of my colleagues will second that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6734.772s">Point</a> of clarification, please.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6739.213s">As</a> a school committee member, if I have a concern at any time, I feel it is my right to ask the superintendent to provide me paperwork to clarify any questions I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6750.101s">So</a> it could be at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6752.343s">But,</a> right.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=6863.752s">Right,</a> and it's more, to clarify what I want, it's more accurate towards the end of the year, what's left in those accounts, what's not left, if we need to allocate more funding to that,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7989.064s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7990.586s">I</a> respect your asking me, but throughout this evening I've raised concerns that I've had with this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=7996.732s">I</a> think direct services to children are my main priority, and I saw areas that allocations could be made towards that that weren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8005.602s">And</a> based on what I <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8008.635s">I</a> have to vote what I feel is best, both for myself and for the students within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8016.26s">So</a> I do understand your want and need for us to be all together, but just because I don't vote in the exact same way with you doesn't mean that I don't respect your decision and why you vote, and I hope you feel the same way with mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8031.433s">and</a> as well as my other committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8034.655s">I</a> honestly really think about these choices and I know that we usually do a whole committee votes yes on the budget and moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8044.12s">And</a> I know this is different for me personally as a committee member, but this is what I feel is necessary for me to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8052.709s">at</a> this time, and I've given multiple reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8055.87s">And</a> if you want me to go over them all again, I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8060.01s">But</a> I'm sure you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8063.391s">So,</a> like, you want me to give you the list? <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8066.392s">Three</a> paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8068.452s">Erin,</a> you do not need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8071.173s">To</a> my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8075.334s">No,</a> no. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8077.654s">Three</a> members asked me to explain why. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8079.955s">And</a> I really feel like I do that throughout the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8082.641s">And</a> I don't mean to be any disrespect. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8086.343s">I</a> do appreciate the things that were added back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8089.545s">And</a> I really thank the superintendent and his staff for going back and reallocating funds so that way we were able to add things tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/FZrFYASlUZo&t=8097.908s">But</a> my vote is my vote, and I feel like it's what I have, and that's what I've done.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_TdmpFxDKEqA/2025-03-21_TdmpFxDKEqA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - June 6, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=529.659s">I</a> just want to say thank you for coming and to all the parents for putting your best foot forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=534.702s">It</a> starts our meeting in a very calm way. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=537.244s">And</a> as you know, I always need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=539.865s">So</a> I really am very grateful for the peace that you brought to us in the art that you all take seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=547.43s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=613.972s">The</a> minutes are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=614.833s">I</a> talked to Mr. Belson a little earlier about our agenda and adding a few items to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=619.415s">You</a> did, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=619.975s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=620.516s">So</a> I didn't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=623.24s">Oh,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=623.981s">Thank</a> you, I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=625.202s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2901.167s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2902.508s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2902.908s">Um,</a> I don't know if all of you know this, but my day job is a special education coordinator at a charter school in Somerville in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2911.272s">So</a> I'm really well aware of what parents can do together. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2916.815s">And</a> at our school, we beg parents to come forward and do work like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2920.557s">This</a> is exceptional work that you all should be very proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2924.859s">This</a> room should be filled though. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2926.08s">If</a> there's 800 families, this should be, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2928.598s">way</a> more people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2930.64s">And</a> I hope it's because they're home with their children, reading books, and helping them with homework, and doing all those so many things, or they're just having a rough night, and that you're representative of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2941.408s">Because</a> the work that you're doing is phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2944.67s">We</a> need to get the word out to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2948.213s">And</a> I know how that is, because I used to be vice co-chair of the PTO at the high school, and it would be the same ones doing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2955.959s">So</a> don't get tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2956.96s">Don't</a> quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2957.66s">Keep</a> going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2958.72s">It's</a> exceptional work. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2960.761s">I'm</a> very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2962.001s">I'm</a> also very happy to see the use of the technical assistance, the accelerated improvement plan in your visual, because I'm a visual learner. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2973.964s">So</a> that's very helpful to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2975.344s">And</a> I'm going to ask the superintendent for some information on what we're currently doing and what we're working with them on to have prepared for that subcommittee meeting, so that way we know <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2988.822s">what</a> areas exactly we're focused on. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2991.603s">I'm</a> making changes so our district is no longer a level three school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2995.404s">I've</a> said it all year and I'm tired of saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2998.105s">I</a> don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=2999.226s">It's</a> very upsetting to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3001.367s">We</a> do great work throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3003.668s">We</a> need to make sure we're educating every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3006.569s">I</a> also want to thank you for the opportunity to come to some of your meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3009.97s">I</a> don't make <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3010.996s">as</a> many as I would like to. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3012.277s">But</a> the question and answer night, I really liked. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3016.101s">I</a> got to mingle amongst parents and really talk to them about different issues that have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3022.166s">And</a> I know people by sight, even though I'm terrible with names. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3026.93s">And</a> I know some of their children now from going to those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3030.153s">So</a> it's a connection that I need and I appreciate having. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3033.876s">I</a> would like to see more of us work with you on those type of situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3038.872s">If</a> there is anything that this group needs from me, my door is open and welcome to comments or suggestions or if you need things brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3048.139s">I</a> am known as a big mouth here and I don't mind advocating for the parents and the students in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3054.843s">And</a> since I work in this area, this is where I feel my expertise is. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3059.226s">So</a> please feel free to come forward and thank you again for all your time, your dedication. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3064.67s">I</a> know you lead this group well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3066.492s">I</a> know you work with our administrators well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3070.494s">We</a> need to keep those doors open, and thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3073.256s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3974.501s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3975.301s">I'm</a> just wondering, have we scheduled the subcommittee meeting for community schools to finalize the charges?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3984.425s">Yeah,</a> the pay structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=3985.785s">I'm</a> wondering if we could do both meetings on one night.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4634.523s">Hi,</a> thank you so much for coming forward with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4639.705s">This</a> isn't the first time this year we've heard it. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4641.826s">I</a> believe it's at least the third. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4644.747s">Recently,</a> we met and parents brought this issue up to us at a committee of a whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4652.67s">And</a> even more recently, when we were going over our budgets with our elementary schools, these questions were asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4663.497s">It</a> was my understanding at that time, and it still is, that recess is only taken away as an extreme last resort. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4671.12s">And</a> it has to have at least three different occurrences documented that the student hasn't been able to get their work done in an appropriate amount of time, and that's all that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4683.023s">But</a> it had to be documented to take cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4685.516s">And</a> now I'm going to ask through you, through the mayor, to the superintendent, to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4690.898s">At</a> our committee meetings, our budget meetings when the Columbus School was presenting, I specifically asked the question regarding recess and that children should be given all their recess at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4704.403s">And</a> I was told that we were going to have a policy in place that they had to be three documented times to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4711.705s">that</a> the child hasn't done their homework, and that recess was going to be taken away before that was to ever happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4719.047s">So</a> I'm asking if that's in place, and if so, we should just write up that as a policy and put it in all our elementary school handbooks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4859.119s">So</a> at this point, I'd like to make a motion that our policy be placed in every elementary school handbook and that it be placed on our website so that our administrators, our teachers, and our parents are well aware of what the school's policy is in place and that if people aren't following it, it can be part of their improvement plan or their evaluation by their superiors <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4883.201s">and</a> that everybody is acting on the same page throughout the district, not one school acting differently than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4889.805s">So</a> I have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4892.047s">I</a> need a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4894.468s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4894.769s">Roll</a> call, please.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4942.769s">Mayor</a> Brooke, if there is school handbooks, it should be in the handbooks as well?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4948.531s">In</a> the policy that parents get three notifications in writing before a child loses recess?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4954.592s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4955.133s">I</a> just want to make sure every school handbook has that policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=4958.153s">In</a> the same language.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5415.917s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5417.238s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5420.26s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5421.221s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5422.622s">I</a> just had a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5423.783s">So</a> the pediatric psychiatrists or the clinical psychologists, will they work directly with our students or will they
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5432.605s">Staff.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5502.249s">This</a> is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5503.29s">The</a> social and emotional needs of our students have expanded dramatically in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5508.533s">As</a> everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5509.63s">and</a> they're not slowing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5511.833s">So</a> any way we can bring in funds or experts to help our students and help our teachers, our nurses, in-house adjustment Councilors and therapists, help our kids and our families, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5527.562s">We</a> need more grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5529.103s">Keep</a> going. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=5529.723s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6195.979s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6197.7s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6198.7s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6199.18s">Pat,</a> thank you so much for this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6201.621s">It's</a> very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6202.781s">And</a> I really like seeing these because I see the total amount, the appropriation each year for each department. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6210.644s">It</a> always surprises me how much we spend and <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6214.385s">how</a> funds are allocated to different departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6217.607s">Now,</a> I know that this is helpful to me right now because I'm very self-aware, especially with the budget coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6223.912s">And</a> I see that some departments don't have as much funding as others. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6230.117s">Our</a> foreign language is under $1 million, but our finance is $1.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6235.141s">And</a> I know that there are more children's services there. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6237.743s">But</a> that helps me when people come forward to me at budget meetings and ask me for a lot of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6243.517s">to</a> have this in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6244.878s">So</a> I just want to say thank you, and I really utilize it well. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6249.282s">Mike,</a> you give us these, is this a quarterly report? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6253.426s">I</a> give you those every time that I make a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6256.089s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6257.93s">Is</a> it monthly? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6258.751s">It's</a> pretty much monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6260.993s">And</a> then quarterly, we're getting the community schools now. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6266.012s">When</a> do we get the food services in the rink? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6268.494s">Can</a> we set up a schedule for finance reports so that way I know exactly which ones we're getting for all of next year ahead of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6277.901s">So</a> I'll know every three months I'll get the community schools, the rink fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6284.526s">Quarterly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6285.407s">So</a> those will be added to these ones on a quarterly basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6289.63s">Quarterly</a> basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6290.511s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6290.992s">This</a> one will be monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6292.333s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6292.953s">Yeah,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6293.533s">I</a> just wanted to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6294.814s">I</a> know we had made that motion, and it came forward to us recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6298.916s">But</a> I wanted to maybe have an outline of when we get them, what months we'll get each report. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6305.059s">Because</a> I think sometimes at the end of the year, when we get our budget book, it does have all of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6310.902s">It</a> will have the rink as well, and it will have all of our buildings, all of our facilities, and all of those budgets, the food budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6319.066s">Is</a> that correct, Mr. Superintendent?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6322.328s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6324.304s">Okay,</a> so those will all be presented soon when you present us with our next year budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6329.549s">Will</a> it also have what we used this year and how funds were allocated? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6333.933s">Like</a> I know sometimes we use community school, you know, if we have extra money in one budget to transfer it for a shortage in another budget, does the school committee vote for that or is that just something that's appropriated?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6377.656s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6378.296s">Now</a> I, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6379.657s">I</a> talked a little bit about this a little earlier about, I know when we met about community schools, there was some community people here that wanted to change what we had initially set, and we were going to meet again. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6392.983s">Will</a> we be meeting so that way we have those budget numbers for the summer programs and for next year's programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6401.287s">For</a> the rate structure? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6402.268s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6410.888s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6411.528s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6412.048s">I</a> know we were talking about, I know that the committee chairperson was talking about June 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6418.491s">I</a> just didn't know if that was a definite date for that subcommittee meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6489.904s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6490.264s">Um,</a> my final thought on that issue is that, uh, I, I've seen that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6496.288s">Camps</a> and programs are being advertised for this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6500.17s">And</a> I just want to make sure that everything goes through the community schools and our new online payment system for starting July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6510.134s">So</a> if all coaches and anybody who plans on using our facilities is made aware of that, that would be extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6518.697s">Because</a> I have been seeing things online. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6521.053s">that</a> are concerning, that maybe everybody in the community doesn't know the new process yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6528.618s">So</a> I would just like that to be communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6531.039s">I</a> understand that you're busy, but I wanted to make sure that we didn't run into the same situations that we had earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6538.084s">So</a> I would like you to address that before the facility is being rented or used and that everybody goes through the proper way and the new way so that we know <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6549.998s">We</a> can look at the calendar and say, so-and-so is renting the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6553.681s">If</a> we were up at the fields and they're using the fields, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6556.564s">If</a> someone else is using the fields, we can say, hey, how come someone's on the field? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6560.107s">It's</a> not rented for this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6562.329s">And</a> who's going to manage that and make sure that's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6565.031s">I'd</a> like some of those answers before we adjourn for the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=6569.635s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7156.9s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7157.661s">Um,</a> I have a, um, I have a great knowledge of the assistant principal at the Brooks school. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7165.526s">She</a> was my daughter's teacher and that was our first year here in the method public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7170.469s">She's</a> an excellent educator. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7172.462s">She</a> really was able to differentiate instruction to everyone in her classroom at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7179.144s">I</a> watched her grow within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7181.024s">I</a> was very happy with her becoming the assistant principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7185.285s">And</a> I wholeheartedly endorse this candidate for that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7189.506s">So</a> just so you have it on record, you have my blessing. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7192.727s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/TdmpFxDKEqA&t=7193.127s">Which</a> you don't usually get, but I thought you'd like to hear that.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_2pAQFYhyG5g/2025-03-21_2pAQFYhyG5g.html">Medford, MA School Committee - May 16, 2016 [Incomplete] (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=836.643s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=839.184s">Hi,</a> I just want to take a moment <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=842.195s">Thank</a> the students for filling this room with beauty and grace and art. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=847.097s">This</a> is art in our community right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=849.697s">We're</a> creating artists. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=851.958s">And</a> Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=852.338s">Chang</a> is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=853.659s">I</a> know my daughter had her many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=855.759s">And</a> you have to hold the bowl in a special way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=859.761s">And</a> she holds them all accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=861.721s">And</a> that's why you are so good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=864.242s">It's</a> because of the teaching you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=865.963s">And</a> my daughter still plays today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=869.184s">Thank</a> you, Mrs. Chang. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=870.597s">as</a> well as Mr. Zigny and all the other people in the music department and the fine arts department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=878.703s">We</a> as a committee have really committed ourselves to arts in our schools, and that has brought more art to our community, and I hope that we can continue this work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=889.392s">Thank</a> you for your time in bringing such beauty and peace into my evening.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3195.163s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3195.764s">Um,</a> I don't agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3198.005s">First</a> of all, when you came in April, I wish I had said something, but you did make me think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3203.768s">And</a> I did request the superintendent's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3206.19s">And</a> that's when I found out that as a school committee member, the June 30th date, I did not know that prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3213.234s">And,</a> um, I'm honest and truthful, but prior to that, there were discussions and there were requests and evaluation processes happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3222.58s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3223.371s">That</a> actual date of June 30th, knowing that, that's where that came about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3228.095s">And</a> I brought it to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3229.985s">after</a> you came forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3231.606s">And</a> I apologize because I know it's not easy to stand there in front of a body of people and a whole nother room full of people and just ask about a process and not making it personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3243.593s">I</a> do this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3245.514s">I</a> do it with asking for budgets and I do it for oh, so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3250.117s">And</a> people think I'm like, what do you want to know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3253.019s">I</a> just want to know what's happening so I can make good judgments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3256.621s">And</a> I think that's what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3258.742s">I</a> think that <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3260.097s">The</a> stuff going on, the parents making comments and bring them up, most of them <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3269.558s">Not</a> all of them, but most of them, about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3273.439s">What</a> do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3274.719s">We've</a> had a great run with Superintendent Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3279.24s">We</a> wouldn't have our science labs without him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3282.481s">I</a> know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3283.681s">I</a> know that better than anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3285.261s">He</a> came to this meeting and presented it, and it's amazing that we have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3289.762s">That</a> got one third of our high school building remodeled at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3293.383s">I</a> mean, I watched in awe as that happened in front of me and made sure that it expanded our whole vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3300.369s">And</a> he's done so many wonderful things, but that does not mean he's going to be here forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3305.714s">And</a> we do need to start the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3308.176s">I</a> have asked for his self-evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3310.938s">As</a> far as I've been told from him, he is going to provide that to us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3315.562s">May</a> 16th is the date he told us at a prior meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3319.265s">I</a> was looking forward to seeing that this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3321.752s">If</a> that date has changed, he can correct me and tell me why that's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3325.775s">But</a> we need sufficient time to go over his self-evaluation and do our evaluation that we do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3332.659s">We</a> do this every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3334.08s">And</a> every year, I talk about his strengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3336.381s">And</a> every year, I talk about areas of growth, just like anyone in any job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3341.804s">And</a> whether or not he has the option of deciding whether he's coming back, but he doesn't have to tell us until September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3349.209s">That's</a> what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3351.15s">My</a> obligation as a school committee member and to the people who voted me into this seat is to make sure you feel that it's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3359.336s">If</a> you ever have a question, I will answer it honestly as to the process and what happened in my eyes and in my viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3366.741s">So</a> I commend you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3369.703s">I</a> know that we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3371.304s">I'm</a> very happy to have the meeting on the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3374.366s">I</a> would like the superintendent's evaluation prior to that so we can provide our <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3380.272s">evaluations</a> of him on that evening so that way we commit and meet our deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3386.141s">And</a> I would like it published in a way that all of our community understands that we're doing this like we did last year, like we did the year prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3396.676s">I</a> don't want to be disrespectful to a person, but I want the process to be more clear, more understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3405.778s">Maybe</a> this year we want to—we've always had the opportunity for people to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3410.799s">We</a> usually don't have that in our audience, and I'm glad to see that some people are here and lined up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3418.221s">But</a> that's a time for when we do his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3422.625s">That</a> might not be tonight, but if you feel like you're here and you're ready to speak, I am more than happy to hear every single person in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3431.406s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3432.126s">So</a> that's my take in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3434.547s">I</a> commend you for coming forward April 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3436.828s">Cause</a> you, you started some me thinking and my actions moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3442.291s">So</a> I don't know if the superintendent is still planning on providing us that information this evening, and maybe we can figure out a timeline right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3450.935s">And</a> I applaud my colleague as far as setting up dates and moving forward and calling for a committee of the whole.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4586.553s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4588.014s">I</a> want to also comment that there is a lot of support in the in the galley for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4594.257s">I</a> know that a lot of teachers heard that this was going to be on the agenda and in parents and they wanted to come out and show their support and that's why the room is full and it's very nice to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4604.561s">And</a> there's also a lot of people here that just want to bring forward the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4609.263s">So</a> in that, taking that into account, I motion that the superintendent provide us with his evaluation by Friday, May 20th, to all school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4624.369s">That's</a> four days after I thought we were going to get it, but that's my first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4629.171s">And</a> my second motion is for us to meet on June 6th to <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4636.865s">to</a> provide the superintendent with our feedback and his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4640.548s">Is</a> the committee meeting scheduled for June 2nd? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4642.71s">Oh,</a> 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4643.211s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4643.671s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4644.052s">That's</a> what I'm trying to get is the date so it's clear to the whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4648.175s">So</a> I would like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4649.437s">I'm</a> making a motion to have that on the agenda so that the whole community knows when everything's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4655.927s">about</a> and if they need to come and make additional comments, they're welcome to come that evening and hear our evaluation as well of the superintendent that we do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4665.311s">And</a> then my last motion would be to have, as a committee, have a succession plan in process on the record by June 30th, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4677.076s">And</a> it doesn't have to be, we as a committee have to provide the superintendent on that date <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4684.304s">whether</a> we are extending his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4687.325s">But</a> in addition to that, this motion is about making ourselves accountable to a date to have a secession plan in place, whether or not we extend the superintendent's contract a year or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4702.328s">So</a> that way, if something were to happen, and life things happen, we have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4709.994s">Mr.</a> Belson is continuing on as our superintendent or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4713.816s">We</a> can go back to that plan, just like a master plan, and put that in effect if anything were to arise at any moment's notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4721.98s">So</a> I'm asking for a second to my motion of all three items.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4759.458s">Madam</a> Mayor, would you like me to read it?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4773.091s">Okay,</a> term. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4774.352s">The</a> superintendent shall be employed for a two-year period commencing July 1st, 2015, ending June 30th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4782.536s">The</a> school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4792.082s">The</a> intent to extend his contract by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4796.104s">We</a> have to decide by that date whether we intend to extend it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4803.516s">that</a> we intend to extend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4805.217s">If</a> we do not tell him by that date, it also goes forward with the superintendent shall notify the school committee of his notice of obligation by September 1st, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4820.822s">Notice</a> of school committee's intent to terminate the contract upon expiration must be given by certified mail, return address request to the superintendent at his address of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4833.007s">So</a> we would have to, if as a committee we were not extending his contract, he would have to have notification to himself by June 30th, 2016 at his home address.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5062.114s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, please succession plan slash process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5066.307s">So</a> even if we come up with the succession plan process by June 30th and we start a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5072.851s">Why</a> don't we say process rather than succession? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5074.972s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5075.653s">And</a> another point of information, um, through you to my colleague, um, the superintendent isn't required to tell us if his intentions until September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5085.779s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5086.435s">We</a> might not know his intention by the time, that's how it's worded in this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5091.999s">I</a> know it's awkward and awful, but that's how the contract is worded if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5096.682s">And</a> I don't think I am.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5198.274s">I</a> would like to change it <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5202.721s">to</a> say a secession plan outline process would be completed by June 30, 2016 or developed by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5216.047s">I'm</a> assuming that it's a working document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5219.408s">I</a> work a lot with IEPs and it's a working document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5222.19s">You</a> come and revisit it many times and make changes and add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5226.502s">And</a> that's how I look at this process.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5230.703s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5235.345s">Well,</a> we need to begin the process, so the process and the outline for a succession plan be started by June 30th.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5246.908s">Yep,</a> that's more reasonable.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5571.503s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5572.043s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5573.044s">One,</a> one, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5574.145s">One</a> more quick thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5575.327s">Um,</a> I know this item, a few items have been on the city council agenda and some of our colleagues have moved over to city council and I just feel like we're working together because they have to approve the ultimate bar budget as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5589.98s">So</a> I believe that the school committee and the city council working together only benefits our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5596.325s">And</a> I look forward to doing that with them in a much more open, direct way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5603.049s">Because</a> I feel like any kind, instead of it being them and us, I want it to be us working together as elected officials to represent all the voters and all the people coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5615.458s">So</a> I just want to say that straight out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5617.659s">And</a> I'm glad that our items are on their agenda and someday maybe some of theirs might be on us.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6460.374s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6462.335s">Thank</a> you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6464.176s">Um,</a> I just wanted to, to address the, the, the gentleman that was just at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6471.119s">Um,</a> I want to, I know you asked, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6473.96s">I</a> know you asked about what, um, we were doing about our, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6478.542s">our</a> level and my colleague is the head of the academic affairs committee and I requested that we hold a committee meeting so that way we could discuss our next steps because we are a level three school district and we need to have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6496.787s">Yeah,</a> I know it upsets you, it upsets me too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6502.353s">So</a> when your MCAS school is in, it's like you're leveling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6505.536s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6505.696s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6506.096s">And</a> it has to do with the ranking as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6508.658s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6509.239s">So</a> we did a committee of the whole to go over ways that we can address, figure out what the exact needs are, what we need to do, and what next steps are to help us <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6522.252s">And</a> I'm going to stop talking now and let the committee chair speak a little bit more about it directly, because we just did this recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6531.795s">So</a> as a committee, we know that that's an issue and that we are bringing that forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7485.683s">Mister</a> Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7486.623s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7487.564s">I</a> reviewed this and it's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7490.685s">There's</a> just the RFP that is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7494.207s">If</a> we could look at number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7496.868s">It</a> says there should be sufficient insurance coverage borne by the vendor to cover any liability damage or liability The city must be held harmless all employees of the contractor who work on-site must be quarry checked and then it goes on to say Appropriate security. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7512.794s">Can</a> we just define what appropriate is so that way there's no error in understanding with with the vendor So
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7587.697s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7588.138s">And</a> I also just want to bring it to attention that these are items that I'll be looking at as, as bids come in and I want to take, have to meet the minimum bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7596.544s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7596.864s">And</a> this, and then number 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7599.757s">It's</a> the end of the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7602.878s">They</a> have to deliver the field in the same condition as it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7607.079s">I'd</a> like to have a certified evaluator to look at the field at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7611.561s">Just</a> to be more specific, not just anyone from the school department walking through who doesn't really understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7619.503s">how</a> the field was. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7620.204s">We</a> can do that outside of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7621.745s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7621.825s">That</a> could be our internal procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7623.666s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7624.147s">As</a> long as it's understood that, you know, I just want to make sure we do it right in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7628.91s">I</a> don't want to come back and say, I wish we added that word or just change those little issues.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7870.781s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7871.801s">Mayor</a> Burke, I just wanted to note a change that we commented on at that committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7879.306s">On</a> the facilities rental agreement, first page, page one of 11, item number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7888.543s">The</a> completed application formed together with all necessary documentation, including certificate of insurance, if required, and a security deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7897.81s">I</a> thought we had changed that to non-refundable security deposit for certain situations.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7906.296s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7906.656s">It</a> doesn't say that, and we were adding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7909.138s">At</a> that meeting, I had it highlighted from that meeting, as well as- Where are we?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7917.364s">It's</a> number two.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7945.303s">Non-refundable</a> for cancellation purposes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7952.62s">It</a> cancels within 48 hours.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7957.841s">Unless</a> they're in 48 hours.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8145.905s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8146.865s">We</a> had also commented on 72 hours at that meeting at that time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8156.463s">Yeah,</a> OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8157.284s">Oh,</a> and then I wasn't finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8159.105s">There</a> is another section on page five. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8162.666s">You</a> know me, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8163.727s">I</a> look for every detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8165.408s">Sorry.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8167.589s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8168.169s">In</a> the Homel Stadium, it was Homel Stadium usage is controlled by Homel Commission, not rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8178.814s">So</a> the usage is <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8181.482s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8182.783s">Didn't</a> we change it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8183.444s">Or</a> was it usage and we changed it to rentals?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8401.829s">I</a> just want to clarify changing the word from rentals to usage because the high school teams don't rent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8409.183s">And</a> even though you schedule it, you schedule it through for the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8414.026s">So</a> you're not doing it as your athletic director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8416.347s">You're</a> doing it as whatever other hat you're wearing at that moment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8421.17s">So</a> I wanted you still to be able to schedule that for usage with no monies attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8428.015s">And</a> that's why I wanted- For Hormel? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8430.996s">For</a> Hormel.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8437.647s">Well,</a> we're putting a blurb in about it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8446.47s">Or</a> use it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8563.333s">I</a> really appreciate your perspective and your knowledge about what the rates are now and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8570.717s">I</a> also agree that both fields should be on the same level in understanding so that way one doesn't get overused or another or waitlisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8582.329s">I</a> agree wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8583.29s">So</a> I agree that Mr. Buckley should probably be at that meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8588.195s">My</a> only concern is keeping the prices low. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8592.088s">I</a> did see the budget for Edgeley Field, and it hasn't come up on the agenda yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8596.391s">And</a> we will get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8597.792s">But</a> last year, we were $95,000 in the red for that field because of the bond and the interest on the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8606.959s">And</a> I know that that has to come in play somehow with usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8611.662s">And</a> this might not be the time when we get further into our agenda for the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8616.165s">We</a> will discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8618.629s">I</a> know that that has been rectified with the payment from the city, so we're not in the red any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8624.071s">But</a> we will get there, and we'll discuss all these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8627.351s">But</a> that's my only concern of keeping the rates too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8632.073s">We</a> want to be able to maintain these without going to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8637.714s">And</a> we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8638.995s">As</a> a school committee, we have to figure out a plan to move forward to make sure we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8643.636s">The</a> bubble might be the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8647.61s">I</a> do appreciate what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8649.651s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9486.285s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9487.366s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9488.486s">I</a> know that this is a great program, and I know that the PTA up at the high school vocational school used to bring in a program called the Yellow Dress and present that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9502.372s">I'm</a> not sure if they're still doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9504.193s">They</a> used to rotate each year, whether or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9507.515s">And</a> I know that the head of the PTA, Ann Rapucci, is retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9515.4s">And</a> so you might want to, maybe we could check in with her and see if they just want to continue that program or help you with this program and help fund it in that way as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10257.182s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10258.683s">I</a> just want to commend Isaac for his work through our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10263.686s">I</a> mean, he's represented Method well for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10266.642s">I</a> remember when he first started running for this seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10271.786s">And</a> it's just been a pleasure to watch him grow up and represent us in such a great way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10277.79s">And</a> the mentoring that you and your staff have given to our vocational students is very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10286.216s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11043.465s">I</a> just wanted to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11044.566s">There's</a> quite an extensive list of colleges that our students have been accepted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11051.631s">This</a> is a great accomplishment, not only to our high school educators, but to our kindergarten all the way through 12th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11059.757s">This</a> shows that what we're doing is producing wonderful, wonderful educated children that are getting into schools throughout the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11071.235s">you</a> know, whether they're Ivy league or down the street, I think it's all, all a tribute to, to what they have learned throughout their, their educational thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11081.062s">Um,</a> this just brought up a reminder that, um, the school committee voted to have, um, some of our parents also on the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11091.448s">And</a> I just wanted to remind the superintendent, I know spoke on the phone about it, about, um, some more, um, students being on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11100.044s">And</a> just to make sure that you touch base with all involved at our high school and vocational. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11106.886s">I</a> know they put the program together and make sure that they're made aware that Mrs. Rapucci and her son will also be present on stage for graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11115.929s">And</a> notify them as well, because I don't think they've been notified yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11120.41s">And</a> moving onward reminded me of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11123.031s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11123.772s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11124.032s">Westmark,</a> for you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=11129.793s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12173.692s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12174.813s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12176.374s">Thank</a> you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12177.755s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12178.576s">And</a> the music tonight was wonderful, as always. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12181.578s">I</a> didn't get the opportunity this year to see the concerts as I usually do.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12190.565s">Thank</a> you very much, because it is the highlight of my end of the school year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12195.929s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12198.011s">I</a> have a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12199.552s">I'm</a> wondering if the cost <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12203.014s">of</a> renting violins in that program leads more parents into going into that program, plus the beginning of starting it a year earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12214.704s">And</a> because I know as a parent who rented to own a saxophone, it ended up being very expensive at the end, compared to a parent whose other child played violin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12230.247s">It</a> was much more affordable, so we need to take into consideration that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12235.212s">But</a> in that regard, I know we were getting all of our antique equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12243.79s">and</a> musical instruments evaluated, and I was wondering where we stood on that situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12249.495s">I</a> don't know if you were aware, Mayor Burke, we have wonderful antique instruments in storage at our high school facility that are very valuable, and we were having them evaluated as to what their worth was, so that way we could let musicians throughout the world bid on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12268.211s">and</a> use them rather than be in our possession and not being used. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12272.973s">So</a> I'd like an update, and I think I asked for this prior, to the superintendent, where we are, what the evaluations are on these pieces of equipment, and what it would take to actually get them out so people could enjoy using them and we could enjoy the money and put it back in our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12293.757s">So</a> I'm making a motion to the superintendent to provide the school committee with a list of inventory, and I know it will take time because right now we're in the beginning of the budget, but maybe by the end of September, have the list of inventory and the value of such items presented to the school committee so we can decide how to move forward from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12319.596s">a</a> motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12867.962s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12869.183s">Do</a> the students have any opportunity to do coding? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12872.885s">Because</a> most of the people in the industry now are desperate for coders in all aspects of, that's all I'm hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12882.232s">And</a> so a lot of high schools and a lot of different schools are teaching students how to code.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12908.472s">Do</a> we offer coding at our high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12910.392s">Is</a> it incorporated in any of the classes or any certification when they come out? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12915.674s">Because</a> I know in industry, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=12918.325s">This</a> is a huge job opportunity, like Paulette said.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13479.464s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13480.405s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13481.245s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13482.245s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13483.146s">Thank</a> you, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13483.746s">And</a> I want to say thank you for sitting with me the other day and showing me how to read some of these documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13489.368s">So</a> I have quite a few questions regarding community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13492.37s">Do</a> we have an estimated amount of what revenue would be coming in from now till the end of the school year? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13498.071s">That</a> would be in the second section of FY16 financial activity receivables.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13512.375s">There'll</a> be some smaller groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13514.215s">So</a> we project $271,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13515.836s">Coming</a> in yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13516.216s">Coming</a> in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13516.556s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13522.225s">When</a> we initially got the community schools budget, it had a negative balance of $95,000 at a subcommittee meeting that has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13532.068s">No,</a> that's the Edgeley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13533.969s">Oh,</a> that's the Edgeley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13534.789s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13535.209s">It's</a> my mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13536.089s">Yeah,</a> community schools has always been in the positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13538.39s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13538.95s">That's</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13539.49s">And</a> community schools does help pay for a lot of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13545.132s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13545.812s">So</a> getting back on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13548.955s">community</a> schools program is changing because of the way that we're going to have people sign up and use the facility with the new software system in the way people pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13559.684s">They're</a> going to, they're going to have to pay, they're going to have to apply online with the new format and the new forms that we provided in the new rates that will be <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13569.832s">determined</a> at a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13573.534s">Um,</a> so what I would like to also propose is that anyone using our facilities also fills out those same exact forms in that the fee structure is just waived so we can track how much, how much usage, how much, how much community uses we allow at no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13593.604s">So</a> that way we know who's on our building at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13597.415s">in</a> that we can track how many wonderful things, opportunities we give our community to use our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13604.1s">So</a> at this time, I would like to see that added to the community schools on July 1st when we transfer over to the new programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13613.608s">So</a> I would like to make that motion this evening.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13626.89s">And</a> could we also add a calendar so that way we should know, like anyone in the community can know who's supposed to be on any field or in any part of our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13637.652s">So</a> if a group is there and a person has rented it, it's very easily bring up the calendar, these people, you've paid for it, you've pulled the permit, you have the time, and the other people have to graciously walk away at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13652.975s">That's</a> the luxury of the software as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13655.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13655.468s">So</a> we just want to make sure that that's available and implemented July 1st as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13662.151s">Is</a> that the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13663.031s">That's</a> our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13664.072s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13665.132s">So</a> I can't tell you how much I love you being in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13671.094s">I'm</a> just going to say that outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13673.195s">I</a> have a couple specific questions about programming that might not directly relate to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13680.178s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13681.932s">So</a> the first one is, I noticed that different programs work out, rent our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13690.597s">And</a> as I was looking through the list, I was wondering if there may be any conflicts of interest with any of our employees working at the school district as well as through any of the rental programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13703.724s">Either,</a> for instance, the Middlesex Reds, the AIC program, or <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13711.176s">Any</a> other person renting? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13715.338s">I</a> just don't want the impression of, I want everything to be on the table and outright and forthright so no questions come to me that I have no answers for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13725.163s">And</a> so through you to the superintendent, do we have staff that work for these programs that also rent our buildings?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13748.771s">As</a> well as other programming like the AIC College.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13763.796s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13764.276s">I</a> just want to make sure that if there's any, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13768.903s">We're</a> following the rules in that we're all doing it and it's disclosed so that way people are aware that their relationship with the school department as well as their relationship with any private entity that is renting our school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13786.125s">I'm</a> not asking, I'm not looking for who does what for which programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13790.528s">I</a> just want to know that there's no ethics violations and that we are in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13795.812s">And</a> I don't want to vote on something that isn't working in the most transparent way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13805.279s">That's</a> all.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13809.381s">Right.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13896.71s">Yes,</a> that's all I'm asking for is to make sure that we're in compliance with all state ethics laws and we're transparent through the community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13908.021s">Because</a> I did not know that AIC was actually an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13913.807s">And</a> maybe we should open that up and let people in our community know that we have this program at our high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13921.514s">as</a> well as our community things, so more people from Medford can take advantage of this college programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13928.177s">I</a> mean, we have these offerings in our high school, and they don't have to go to other towns to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13932.919s">And</a> if they need to expand their knowledge and their educational base, they can do it right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13940.342s">But</a> I don't know if it's that transparent to everybody.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13966.928s">And</a> I have another question specific to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13972.743s">How</a> many hours are they using our building, and how did we determine what the fee structure was for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=13978.285s">I</a> mean, I just want to be transparent here.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14019.01s">My</a> question about that is, is do they use the same amount of time as our, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14026.054s">as</a> the Japanese school does? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14028.256s">And</a> if they do, why is their fee so different? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14031.218s">That's</a> my only question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14044.209s">But</a> if you count those hours, if it's six hours and the Japanese school has our building, it's six hours.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14064.777s">I</a> thought I saw a line item for $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14066.378s">Yeah,</a> that's for two years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14073.501s">OK.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14076.082s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14076.622s">It</a> just looks like in the financials that we get, it looks like it's $200,000.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14086.876s">Just</a> for clarity, my goal here is to make sure that we are being transparent, we're following state ethics laws, and we're doing the same amount for them as we are for any other program, especially if our employees are working at this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14102.863s">I</a> just want it to be no questions asked and everything on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14108.006s">And</a> I'll move on to my next question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14124.874s">So</a> I have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14125.895s">I'm</a> sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14126.535s">But</a> the vocational evening classes and stuff like that, does that come in through those community schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14135.7s">Or</a> is that separate? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14136.961s">It's</a> a separate revolving fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14138.492s">Okay,</a> and where is that accounts and how do we see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14144.155s">Do</a> we see that as a school committee?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14158.343s">Okay,</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14158.824s">And</a> it is kept separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14160.645s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14161.745s">I</a> just don't want to vote on a budget and be missing pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14166.637s">and</a> I just didn't know how that came into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14169.119s">Okay,</a> so there are a lot of adjusted journal entries on this data, and I know you explained it to me, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14176.985s">Could</a> you just go over it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14177.846s">Like,</a> I know there's one for $480,000, 450, 480, I'm sorry, it's late, $553.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14180.028s">Can</a> you give me a page? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14180.828s">I'm</a> looking at, hmm, so on page one, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14196.091s">But</a> that page is like five pages in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14199.973s">FY16?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14200.313s">It's</a> actually June 30, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14204.635s">It</a> says JE01 Adjustment Budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14210.478s">Post</a> errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14211.639s">I</a> just wanted to be clear that adjustments are made in this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14218.022s">I</a> don't know how to read a lot of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14219.523s">I'm</a> trying to learn more and more.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14238.501s">So</a> we had the money in a different fund and it moved to this fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14243.123s">More</a> than likely.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14245.625s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14246.185s">So</a> I know we discussed about <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14248.537s">Hopefully</a> looking at different programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14251.341s">So</a> this is easier to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14253.944s">I</a> know that might be on the city side and maybe some Councilors, the mayor might facilitate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14260.133s">So</a> this way it's not quite so confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14262.676s">Like</a> for me, this is hard to read.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14268.805s">Yeah,</a> and I don't know what that means a lot of the time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14290.551s">So</a> I just want, like, because the documents are out there and they, someone sees that adjustment to the budget, $480,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14299.16s">I</a> mean, it's because an adjustment was made, but it doesn't specify why it was made, how it was made, what budget it came from.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14312.203s">So</a> it's just difficult for me as a school committee member to know all the ins and outs of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14319.067s">So</a> I'm all in favor of a better programming, so maybe it's accounting 101 instead of 104. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14328.38s">Okay,</a> so that's that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14330.501s">I</a> just wanted to bring everybody's attention to the overtime for our custodians in this thing is $93,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14339.687s">That</a> seems like a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14341.328s">I</a> know it's overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14342.509s">I</a> know maybe we could figure something out with flexible schedules and next time we negotiate with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14350.888s">But</a> if we're spending that much money, maybe we could hire another person and have them do different hours so we're not always paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=14359.256s">I'd</a> rather give someone a job than if we're going to spend that amount of money.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Httzg9o9WVA/2025-03-21_Httzg9o9WVA.html">Medford, MA School Committee - May 2, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1099.053s">Oh,</a> I was just going to ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1100.354s">Lewis</a> if she could email us a copy of Hannah's writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1107.316s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1108.557s">That</a> would be terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1109.657s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1110.617s">And</a> congratulations to Hannah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1112.738s">But</a> we know kids come from our elementary schools and build their knowledge through our middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1120.12s">And</a> then they get to the high school, and our high school teachers get to watch them bloom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1125.947s">It's</a> from all the way through. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1127.448s">It's</a> an educational experience, K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1129.871s">And</a> I'm very proud of the students here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1132.695s">Method's</a> doing really great things in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1135.938s">And</a> I'm glad to honor so many students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1138.101s">I</a> see a line in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1139.803s">So</a> thank you again, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=1140.944s">Loeb.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3113.237s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3114.118s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3114.858s">I</a> actually have another topic about legislators, so I thought I would speak on it now, if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3121.058s">I</a> know a few months ago, Mr. Skerry and I met with Christine Barber and Sean Gobley about homelessness in the state of Massachusetts and specifically about transporting homeless children and maybe redirecting some of those funds into being proactive rather than reactive and help families stay in their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3141.436s">But</a> the school system here in Medford, we've spent already over $100,000 transporting <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3146.5s">homeless</a> students to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3148.642s">And</a> those students don't all live in Medford any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3152.366s">They</a> sometimes live in hotels or motels or shelters, and it's still Padawa's responsibility to give them a safe place to come to school every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3161.936s">But</a> given that work, Christine Barber and I sat down in Mississippi, too, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3170.02s">to</a> write an amendment to this year's budget and it passed the State House of Representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3175.424s">And</a> the purpose was to form a commission to review the costs and challenges to finding homeless students, transportation services, and to make recommendations on how to improve this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3188.618s">Before</a> July of 2017, the commission will create a report that will include a review of the federal McKinley-Vento Homeless Children and Youth Assistance Act, a budget assessment, a review of methods used by school districts now to bid and to procure transportation, a review of the best practices in other states, and finally, recommendations for improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3214.524s">So</a> just as an example, I work at a neighboring district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3218.606s">And</a> if I have a homeless student that lives in a homeless shelter in Dorchester, just to put it in perspective, that needs to go to school in Cambridge, I pay, along with the City of Medford, $275 a day to transport one child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3235.641s">That's</a> not their housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3236.822s">That's</a> not their food. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3238.163s">That's</a> just to get them to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3240.926s">And</a> that is like $6,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3244.242s">We</a> need to change how we do this in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3247.705s">And</a> when Mr. Belson presented us with some facts and figures a few months ago, and how much Medford was paying, and then actually in my other job, my day job, of actually getting kids and families' rights to school, and how difficult it is to get people because there's not enough drivers, I saw a bigger picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3271.142s">So</a> we're working towards fixing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3274.051s">And</a> this is the first step. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3275.252s">It's</a> a small step, but it went through the House, now it will go through the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3278.415s">So</a> if any of you know senators, please give them a call. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3282.118s">Tell</a> them you support this amendment so it stays on there, so we can have a commission and really talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3288.117s">what's</a> working, what's not working, and how we keep families in homes rather than in homeless shelters and driving them back and forth from there to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3295.519s">Thank</a> you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3296.419s">I</a> really appreciate it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3901.114s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3903.616s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3904.157s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3906.399s">Great</a> accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3908.36s">A</a> lot of work this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3909.641s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3910.001s">And</a> it really shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3911.162s">And</a> it shows by the awards that were given out this evening as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3914.405s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3916.006s">So</a> kudos to all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3918.368s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3919.793s">The</a> increase in the amount of children in our elementary school, and it might not be directed to you, it might be, Madam Mayor, to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3927.5s">Has</a> there been an increase, an enrollment increase in recent years that we have more students in our elementary school that we need to add more journeys, stuff?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3964.699s">So</a> just to follow up on that, I know there's been a lot of building and a lot more condos and apartment buildings in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3973.054s">And</a> I know there's room. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3977.535s">And</a> we just want to keep that in mind for our services. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=3981.157s">So</a> Mayor Burke, I hope that when they build or propose a lot of apartments and buildings, that we keep in mind how many teachers and how many firefighters and how many police officers we'd have to add to the community to make sure that we have safe streets and really good educators in our school and we're not overcrowding anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4003.225s">I</a> know we're not even close to overcrowding, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4005.65s">But</a> I want to make sure we keep the ratio that we currently have, and the supply costs, and how it will affect us as a community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4013.559s">So</a> could you just please keep an eye on that and keep us informed as that happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4018.404s">Because</a> we're already almost 50 children higher for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4024.011s">This</a> year enrollment, and this is very early to have that many, because there's a lot that come through the summer as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4031.513s">That</a> means that we might need to be careful with staffing and make sure that we have enough staff for September and add classrooms in which schools and which areas they're going to need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4042.655s">So</a> any updates on that, I'd appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4045.416s">Again,</a> thank you for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4046.796s">We'll</a> do our best to help you with the items that you request. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4050.115s">There's</a> always a lot of requests and it's hard to prioritize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4053.281s">If</a> you had to pick one thing that was really important.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4091.4s">Thank</a> you for prioritizing, and thank you for your work on the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4094.383s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4913.261s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4914.542s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4914.902s">I</a> just want to say thank you so much for a great report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4918.525s">Vento.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4918.906s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4919.466s">I</a> appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4921.227s">Also,</a> I just wanted to take this opportunity to talk about the nursing staff stepping up with the substance abuse issue in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4929.374s">Because</a> in our elementary schools, maybe a nurse doesn't need to carry knock-in for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4935.817s">But</a> maybe for one of their parents that are dropping them off or picking them up, or another relative that's there visiting the school at an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4943.638s">So</a> the fact that you had total compliance throughout your department is really touching and very appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4951.34s">And</a> I just wanted to go on record stating that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4954.06s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4957.501s">We're</a> fortunate to have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4962.464s">new</a> check-in with, I believe it's the ninth graders, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4966.486s">Yes,</a> the screening.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4975.231s">That's</a> probably better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4975.911s">I'd</a> like the kids to get in and get settled and then just really see the reality of what they're like once they're settled into high school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=4997.833s">So,</a> not directed at you, Mayor Burke, through you to the superintendent, Mr. Bellson, how are we communicating this fact that this screening is going to be taking place with our students in January of next year for our freshmen?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5064.829s">could</a> we possibly use our PR person to make sure that people in the community know that we're doing these types of screenings and that we're really serious about substance abuse in our community and we're here to help any student that needs help and it's not to be to <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5080.684s">It's</a> not to be punitive, it's really to help students and help families that might need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5086.587s">And</a> I know the screening not only screens them for themselves, but also if they're dealing with a family member as well, right?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5094.97s">It's</a> really more about the student's specific risk behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5098.271s">OK,</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5099.232s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5099.532s">Well,</a> that's good to know, too, for my education. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5102.561s">Thank</a> you again for your report, and I'm going to ask you the same question that I asked Dr. Chiesa. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5108.568s">What</a> are your top priorities? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5109.929s">What</a> are your top needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5111.751s">I</a> mean, we'd love to fill every position that's requested from us, but that's really not possible for us to do, and we need to know what people's first priorities are.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5568.251s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5569.132s">I</a> just wanted to have the superintendent email us with any updates on the opening of school and how it went and if there were any issues or bus issues because this is a late start to me, but I understand because of religious holidays, that's why it's scheduled at this point, at least that's what I'm assuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5589.865s">But</a> I would like updates.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5967.105s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5968.647s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5969.588s">On</a> number three, I agree that we need to put the 50% discount for any residents who are refugees. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5977.618s">Also,</a> I wanted to talk a little bit about the start time and the weekend time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=5989.74s">We</a> never really discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6005.259s">So</a> I'd like to see that <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6030.595s">Also,</a> we talked about this, but it's not mentioned in here, a snacks shack slash sale of goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6038.861s">We</a> should either ban it in the beginning and renegotiate if that comes up, and if so, I would like to see our youth groups, like maybe the youth soccer, a non-profit youth group, be able to run that, or the high school, or the students, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6057.535s">extracurricular</a> activities are that way, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6061.701s">That</a> needs to be a separate discussion and maybe not allowed at this point, so that way they're clear that's not allowed, they can't just set that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6069.831s">And</a> if they want to, they need to revisit us and that would be a separate contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6075.907s">OK,</a> because that would be a lot involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6078.229s">Also,</a> I think number 12, the substantial non-rental time must be available to math and athletic and physical education and community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6088.467s">for</a> educational and recreational program and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6091.689s">I</a> think we need to be much more specific there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6094.491s">I</a> think it's just too general and I think we have to be very clear what we want and what we expect so we get what we want and we're not surprised that we don't have everything we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6104.478s">So</a> those are my notes and my things and I'd like to talk more about that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6554.467s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6555.648s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6556.369s">I</a> also want to reiterate what my colleague, Mr. Skerry, talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6563.615s">We</a> do request to see the committee vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6576.783s">more</a> funds coming in than the payment money, what we were doing then, how maintenance is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6582.646s">I</a> did walk the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=6584.867s">I</a> didn't walk the middle of it because children were playing on it and it looked in pretty good shape, but I did speak with people who were very involved at the beginning and they said that the field usually lasts between 12 and 15 years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7091.298s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7092.638s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7093.618s">Um,</a> I also, we also need to figure out, uh, Christmas and February break. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7098.013s">Because</a> if they stay to the 4 o'clock schedule, then we, if we add any youth camps for our students or our families, then we would be able to take them outside.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7183.515s">I</a> just, sorry, I just have, I would like to know what the penalty fees were and I would like to see the wording of it before we send it to the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7192.726s">I</a> don't want to hold up the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7194.348s">I</a> really don't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7287.894s">The</a> only other piece I have is, um, once, once we figure out the fees and all that, the penalty fees, I think that's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7296.16s">I</a> really want to see a dollar amount on there and I don't want it to be a little dollar amount.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7302.045s">Penalty</a> fees, but going over or going too early or, <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7305.636s">not</a> having security or whatever rules that they may break, I want a fee attached to them for breaking any and all rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7313.86s">Because</a> I know with our buses, I think there's a penalty fee for certain things, and it makes them do things really well really quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7324.328s">So</a> I would like to see that here.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7328.85s">$5,000</a> for... Just for guidance? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7331.551s">$5,000</a> for staying late for... Well, stay there till 1 in the morning, because no one's going to be up there, and we have 20 neighbors calling us, or maybe if it's after three offenses, or $1,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7343.797s">I</a> mean, I want it to be significant enough so that they're not going to do it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7383.716s">So</a> why don't we go $250, $500, $1,000, and then after the third offense, you can lose your contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7392.759s">That's</a> the motion on the floor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7512.602s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7513.342s">So</a> Mayor Burke, in that two weeks, I would like to see Mr. Skerry's request for the funds that we collect now for the fields, so that way we have a total understanding of what's currently happening before we vote on more. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7528.57s">And</a> the second thing is, we talked at the last meeting about a point person and who's going to be the person that is the point person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7537.577s">the</a> contact for this company, the liaison for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7542.38s">And</a> I know that our community schools director is also our athletic director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7546.763s">And</a> at this point, I'd like to see a recreation slash community schools director hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7554.547s">And</a> then that pooling person would be the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7557.549s">But</a> I want to make sure we have something in place and we're not just adding more to Bobby Mone's lap, because he already has so many facilities to bring. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7567.192s">the</a> field, so many things already, the new batting cages, the swimming pools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7574.777s">I</a> mean, we can go on and on and on, not to mention his role as the athletic director. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7579.439s">So</a> I really don't think that he's the appropriate person to be the point person for this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7585.303s">And</a> so that has to be discussed and brought forward as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7588.225s">I</a> mean, that's a very important piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7590.526s">So</a> I'd like to see what your proposal is on that in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7594.188s">I'll</a> give you time to think about that and see <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7597.442s">It</a> needs to be a significant thought.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7718.818s">All</a> set? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7721.699s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7722.619s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7723.239s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7728.574s">My</a> last thing with this before we move forward is I'd really like.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7795.337s">I</a> just want the revised one of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7798.62s">That's</a> all I'm requesting before it goes to the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7801.962s">I</a> don't want to send it to the RFP yet until we see this revised list and make sure everything's on here and everybody's concerns are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7810.769s">And</a> then we're not having the RFP drawn up twice or adding to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7819.187s">Move</a> this until the subcommittee meeting of May 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7824.354s">Motion</a> to move this list as amended for the RFP.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7963.164s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7964.425s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7965.205s">I'm</a> sorry to stop the proceedings, but we received a few things on our desk and I'd like, um, the superintendent to explain this item.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=7991.956s">So</a> is there a fee charged to this group to use our facility?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8004.221s">And</a> shouldn't this have come before us for our approval for rental? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8007.462s">Because</a> this is a one-time event.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8054.348s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8055.649s">Thank</a> you so much, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8057.93s">So</a> it says free admission ticket required for the cultural event. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8061.992s">Is</a> there a charge being? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8063.732s">Is</a> this a non-profit using our facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8067.254s">Is</a> it a church-based program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8074.938s">Do</a> you know what cost is involved for people to come up into our facility?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8081.981s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8083.652s">Is</a> there a cost to the community to come to this event?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8091.079s">And</a> do you know what they're charging our community members?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8099.264s">I</a> really have an issue with this not coming before us and a fee not requested in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Httzg9o9WVA&t=8108.33s">I'd</a> like to make a motion that any rentals of our facility, while we're reviewing it, come before the committee before approval.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=870.333s">Okay,</a> so it wasn't while you were trying to bring children in. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=873.016s">So</a> I'm glad for that because that could just make it more difficult to secure all the areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=880.324s">Thank</a> you for the follow-up and following the procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=883.167s">I</a> appreciate through you to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=888.671s">I</a> appreciate that the quickness in response to letting all community members know. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=895.094s">That</a> is imperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=896.034s">We</a> learned that from the last situation that we just went through. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=899.456s">So</a> we actually put in place what we had hoped to. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=903.198s">I</a> know that some parents wanted us to put a timeline to how quickly we were going to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=908.84s">And</a> I think that is actually earlier than any timeline that we would have put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=915.223s">And</a> I hate to put a number on people when they're dealing with crisis situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=920.406s">So</a> this is exactly how it's supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=922.467s">I'm</a> grateful that there was no bombs, and that our children and our staff were saved. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=927.27s">And</a> thank you, I'm glad the protocol works, and thank you, headmaster.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1060.891s">Certainly,</a> Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1063.25s">When</a> we set the protocols in place, we also said that within 24 hours we would get a completed update to parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1071.635s">So</a> if there's any additional information for parents to know, like maybe just, I don't know, an email or I don't know how you do it best, just say, you know, today was a good day, we had no further threats. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1085.122s">But</a> we, in the protocol, we said if they had more details, we would follow up after the initial, letting them know there is a situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1092.767s">And</a> once you had more details, you would follow up within the next day, by the next day. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1097.691s">Would</a> you just look into that and just make sure that all protocols are followed all the way through?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1107.09s">OK,</a> or even have a public relations person put out something that would be helpful.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1134.678s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1135.499s">Unfortunately,</a> it's a new normal right now.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1784.541s">Mr.</a> Bell, sir, is there a way that we can work on a school-wide, a district-wide program to get every child in Method Public Schools a library card?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1812.01s">Maybe</a> we could have it in different languages so that parents who English isn't their first language, that they understand what they're signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1819.174s">And</a> even if they got a temporary library card and had to go to the library to get the actual one. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1825.116s">So</a> that way it reminds them, oh, and they bring something home and say, I have my library card. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1830.32s">We</a> need to go to the library kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1832.442s">And</a> they get points or extra credit or however we need to get them in the door and show them what we have to offer.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1842.62s">Can</a> we set up a program? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1843.761s">Can</a> we identify someone in the school district to work on this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1847.701s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1848.642s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1849.062s">And</a> can we set a timeline for this to happen?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1855.743s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1856.003s">So</a> that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1857.643s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1858.383s">You</a> put in parent information as well?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1884.648s">public</a> school, like how many students, how many people have library cards, how many children? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1889.992s">Oh</a> goodness, not off the top of my head, I don't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1897.217s">So</a> maybe we can work with the liaison from the schools and see what percentage we're at and then do a drive or do a sign up and then see how successful it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1906.604s">Like,</a> and if we can get, the hottest children to get are the ones who's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1911.755s">whose</a> parents are working two jobs, or English isn't their first language, and we don't want to ignore those children, so we want to have a list of who we're missing, and really follow up, and really make sure children in Method have this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1926.939s">Because</a> that way they don't even have to go to the library, they can read books from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1930.601s">And</a> a lot of families don't have the money or the time to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1933.663s">And</a> if a child gets to read a book when they're bored instead of playing on a computer, it might be a, you know, it's a win or a fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=1941.287s">And,</a> you know, they are using the computer to read.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2967.071s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2969.43s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, so I just want to explain really well to parents that the insurance might not cover 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2977.128s">With</a> a previous trip, it covered like 75% of the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2981.65s">So</a> whatever those rules are, I just wanna highlight it with the parents so they understand that they are taking a risk, especially because the world is so volatile right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=2991.733s">If</a> there's any reason that the school committee feels it's not safe and has to cancel that trip, then they're aware that they're responsible for the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3000.577s">We</a> did make a one-time exception this year, but we wouldn't be able to do that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3005.679s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3006.759s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3007.559s">Mrs.</a> DiCarlo, thank you again for doing this for so many years and giving so many children this opportunity in their life to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3015.481s">It's</a> a gift that they'll carry forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3018.482s">Great</a> teachers do great things.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3245.482s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3246.122s">And</a> how do you think having science labs has helped you? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3249.786s">Because</a> you're one of the first students that have gone through having a few years with the new labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3258.795s">And</a> what's your experience been using them compared to what we used to have at the high school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3317.618s">I</a> love those hoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3318.938s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3320.039s">No?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3320.259s">We'll</a> have to work on that, Mr. Cieri, and bring the Tufts people down, because I think our facility is just as nice, if not better, than some of theirs, if I'm not mistaken.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3340.034s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3340.835s">That's</a> really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3341.616s">Thank</a> you for your perspective on that, because as a committee, we worked really hard to see that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3347.762s">And</a> I'm so happy that you had the opportunity to use them. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3351.506s">And</a> thank you, Mr. Cieri.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3958.98s">Can</a> there be something in the policy that has all of our teachers, coaches, and anyone supervising children throughout the district have to sign that they've read this policy and that kept on record? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3972.931s">I</a> also would like that for parents as well, that parents are made aware of the drug and alcohol policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3978.776s">I</a> don't know if it's just at the high school, but even junior high. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3982.318s">I</a> mean, if it's a handbook or a part of their registration that they've signed, that they've read, this is such an important document throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=3990.703s">And</a> I want signed by every coach, every teacher, every everyone that they have read and they understand the policies and they're going to take appropriate action for any happenings.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4065.862s">But</a> as far as teachers, staff, co-teachers, any policy change should be sent to them and they should have to sign off, especially in regards to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4076.21s">My</a> last comment was about Method Overcoming Addiction is having an event this Sunday night at 6 o'clock at the Karen Theater, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4089.32s">It's</a> a second annual vigil. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4092.222s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4092.522s">It's</a> Sunday night at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4095.49s">So</a> I just wanted to put that out to the community as a reminder. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4099.973s">But</a> I would like that to go in the policy that all teachers and staff and all coaching, whether they're voluntary or paid, they all need to sign that they have read and implement this alcohol and drug policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4117.425s">Who</a> can add that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4852.497s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4853.718s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4854.439s">I</a> just want to talk a little bit about the post-prom party. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4857.661s">I</a> was very involved with that while my children were up at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4862.485s">We</a> have between 200 and 250 children that attend there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4865.187s">It's</a> extremely well run. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4871.9s">They</a> have so many offerings for our children, and I really encourage parents to send their junior children there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4878.807s">They're</a> safe, they're locked in, and if they leave, the parents are called. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4883.292s">If</a> they don't come, their parents are called to say, hey, your child hasn't come and they signed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4889.483s">It's</a> a lot of fun, they have, you know, hypnotists, they have mechanical bulls, they have food all night, and a lot of things are donated to our community, which is really a lovely gesture. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4900.13s">But</a> the most important thing I really wanna talk about is the person who runs the Up All Night Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4904.974s">Her</a> name's Ann Rapucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4906.755s">She's</a> been a parent in Medford School Systems for a very long time, and her youngest is graduating this year, Eric Rapucci. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4916.342s">So</a> she's been running this event, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4918.643s">for</a> between 10 and 15 years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4920.904s">I'm</a> sure it's over 10, and it might be just under 15, but it might even be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4926.607s">She's</a> a phenomenal woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4927.928s">She</a> gets the job done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4929.389s">She</a> organizes people. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4930.609s">She</a> gets things donated. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4932.951s">They</a> do an event to raise the money for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4937.293s">It's</a> phenomenal, it's fun, it's for the safety of our children, and she runs many, many other things up at our high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4945.078s">She's</a> the president of the PTO, a co-president for Metro Witch right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4949.34s">She's</a> done a phenomenal job, and I'd like to honor her here at the school committee, so maybe we could do a plaque because of so many years of service, and maybe, if possible at graduation, have a seat for her as her youngest leaves our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=4963.788s">and</a> as she leaves our community as a parent who has donated their time for so many consecutive years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5693.499s">Oh,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5695.02s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5696.621s">So</a> through you to the superintendent, speaking of conserving energy, we had talked about the new lights at the Curtis School as well as the vocational school quite a while ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5709.349s">And</a> you were going to speak with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5711.13s">Hunt,</a> and we were going to price it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5713.252s">Because</a> wasn't there an option that we could take a loan out <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5718.955s">And</a> then the savings that we would make would pay back the loan.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5737.05s">I</a> just didn't hear that update, so that's terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5741.153s">And</a> my other questions were about maintenance and equipment for our lunch facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5748.378s">I</a> know last year when we raised the rate, we did talk about items and that was part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5755.361s">And</a> we talked about not waiting until things were really bad about changing fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5760.483s">We</a> didn't want to do big lump sum fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5762.864s">So</a> we just want to make sure that we have enough money to maintain the items we need to and not hit parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5770.287s">with</a> large increases over time, and that's just a reminder of that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5785.478s">Okay,</a> and if there are items that need to come up in the next year or so, we need to maybe have that reported at our budget session so that way we can plan for them for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5796.301s">So</a> if they are looking at things and they say, well, these things can be repaired and these things can't and these need to be replaced, then maybe we could bring them forward in the next month or two so we can look at that with our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5808.644s">Thank</a> you, and thank you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5810.125s">It's</a> always great. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=5810.725s">You're</a> welcome.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6061.568s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6062.188s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6064.31s">I</a> just actually wanted to know if we could invite the students to come to the city council because it's the first year and hopeful. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6072.557s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6074.559s">It's</a> been a long night. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6075.84s">School</a> committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6077.242s">So</a> that we can present certificates of achievement to them and because they <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6083.995s">They</a> really modeled great behavior and great ability, and they kicked butt throughout the districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6092.181s">So</a> if we could invite them here and honor them for their achievement, that would be great.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6457.025s">Mr.</a> Benedetto, thank you, and thank you for looking into this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6463.868s">So</a> do we have dates of when these policies were put into place, out of these four, which is the most recent that was approved?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6653.697s">So</a> I'm not finished yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6656.339s">You</a> didn't really answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6657.82s">Which</a> of these four policies are the one that we have enacting now and the most recent? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6663.664s">That's</a> the question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6669.928s">We</a> currently don't have a policy in place that we can rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6672.591s">Point</a> of information?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6816.088s">So,</a> thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6818.128s">Thank</a> you for the point of information regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6822.529s">I</a> believe that when I was researching this issue, the MASC source is the source that I got from our publications. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6834.052s">So,</a> this was the understanding I had when I went to that meeting on April, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6841.353s">The</a> 19th of last month, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6844.417s">So</a> this is why I brought this forward, March 19th's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6848.041s">And</a> this is what I brought to the meeting and handed to you, Mr. Superintendent, because this is what was posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6855.209s">And</a> on it... <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6857.751s">So</a> I believe that this was our current lease. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6862.576s">And</a> I'm all for changing it and making it new and creating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6867.2s">But</a> that's why I would like to have a committee of the whole, not only to go over this issue, but to go over community schools as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6874.967s">I</a> want to know who's renting our schools, what we pay to use the gym at the McGlynn compared to the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6881.072s">I</a> want to know everything, who's using our, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6884.656s">our</a> theater, what group it is, how much they pay, whether they're for profit, whether they're not for profit, if they take out insurance to use our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6893.087s">I</a> want a complete understanding of what's happening in this district, in these situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6900.296s">I</a> want to know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6901.517s">I've</a> been asking for it for a month now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6904.339s">It's</a> on our agenda because I asked for the list of things that were requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6909.502s">And</a> I also would like the date those things were requested on the back of our agenda as well, so we know how long they have been outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6916.966s">I</a> want to move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6918.667s">I</a> don't want it to take another school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6921.509s">I</a> don't want another company displacing any of our students because we're making our buildings <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6928.633s">available</a> to for-profit companies and displacing students from practicing for plays, or using facilities, or any other thing that might come along. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=6940.677s">I</a> don't know who's using them, I don't know what they're paying, if they're paying, who they're paying, so I want a whole understanding, and that's why I requested a meeting, and I think it needs to happen within the next three weeks.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7250.783s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7252.843s">In</a> regards to letting people use it, can we get a list of people that we would be voting to let use our facilities free of charge? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7262.765s">Also,</a> we voted that there would be a monitor there at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7267.866s">So</a> who would be paying for that monitor to be present? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7270.606s">And</a> who's going to open and close the facility and make sure that it's picked up? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7276.067s">There's</a> more than just letting people go in and out of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7280.888s">I</a> mean, I'm not comfortable voting yes on this, and I actually don't approve for this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7292.741s">Until</a> we figure out what we're doing, we should do that as quickly as we can so that community members can access our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7301.25s">But</a> we want to make sure it's done in the correct and appropriate way. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7304.453s">If</a> someone gets hurt up there and there's not a monitor in place, who are we hiring? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7308.697s">What</a> are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7309.878s">I'm</a> not comfortable moving forward with this, and I would like to table it this time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7356.422s">Or</a> insurance, or staff was there.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7367.789s">They</a> can use the gym as they used to before the cages were. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7372.131s">It's</a> not so that they can't.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7757.556s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7758.536s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7759.297s">Um,</a> so I would like a list of exactly which, which community groups you would do. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7764.398s">And</a> I would like to know if they're nonprofit before we vote on this as a school committee, we need to know who's using our facilities and what we're voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7773.121s">Um,</a> so that's very important to me at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7775.742s">I</a> would like only nonprofit Medford community organized groups to be able to, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7782.605s">to</a> use the cages during this transition time. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7786.507s">And</a> I also don't understand why they can't use one of the cages which is what they would have used had the batting cages not been set up.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7816.877s">And</a> who's going to make sure that that's the only people using these cages? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7824.323s">Who</a> has the key to the cages? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7826.165s">And</a> who will be unlocking them and locking them when they leave?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7851.235s">Also,</a> on Mr. Maloney's recommendation to have somebody up at the cage area at all times when they're in use. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7861.766s">So</a> that was going to be used to pay for that was the usage fees that we were going to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7868.233s">So</a> now that we don't have usage fees and we're giving this out free, <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7874.108s">We</a> want to make sure that that policy is still in place, because we voted on that already, that that was our intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7880.651s">So</a> I want to make sure that that's happening, and I would like to know how those funds are going to be covered.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7918.867s">And</a> I also have one last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7920.868s">Does</a> the fire marshal or anyone have to inspect that area and give us an estimate of how many students can fit up there safely at a time? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7928.313s">Or</a> how is that determined?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7937.779s">Have</a> they seen it?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7955.942s">I'd</a> also like a list of people who currently have keys to that area.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=7962.773s">Thank</a> you, I'd appreciate that information, and I'll add that to the list.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8515.62s">I</a> did get a ruling from the state ethics, and I am allowed to vote on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8521.281s">But</a> at this time, I would like to go with the superintendent's request in this report is to withhold the letter due to the changes that are taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8533.144s">And</a> I'm not sure that those might be complete by the May 2nd, because it will have to go to the House's representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8539.566s">And</a> there's a great bill on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8542.846s">There</a> are great parts of it, but there are parts that need <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8546.027s">I've</a> read the whole bill that needs some tweaking and some changing, and I believe that that's going to happen in the House of Representatives, and then again at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8554.972s">So</a> if we send this, it might not be good timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8558.634s">It's</a> already in debate there. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8560.455s">So,</a> I mean, we could write a letter based on what we think the bill is like, and that's, I think, more relevant.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8845.452s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8846.633s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8848.654s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, I agree with you regarding this issue because there is so many changes taking place right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8857.258s">I</a> do have a copy of the bill that was passed in the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8860.979s">Pat</a> Jalen was kind enough to send that to me and asked me to go over a few things and my opinions with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8869.363s">So</a> I'll be doing that in the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8873.732s">So</a> I really think that we as a school committee want to represent ourselves as educated as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8880.174s">So</a> I'll be happy to forward that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8882.514s">And</a> then you can then forward it on to the other colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8885.135s">So</a> if they want to review what's on there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8888.015s">I</a> do see some valid points about reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8892.196s">And</a> this bill is very important because it brings up the conversation that needs to be had throughout the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8900.23s">But</a> it also has a few things in there that really, really aren't in the best light for either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8909.613s">So</a> that's why I plan on sitting with our state senator and talking to her about that as an individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=8920.004s">So</a> I really agree with you, Superintendent, about being really aware of what's going on out there before we send a letter that makes us look like we're a few weeks behind.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9009.117s">Very</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9011.878s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9014.163s">Mr.</a> Skerry and I had the opportunity to meet with a few of our state representatives regarding a homeless transportation issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9021.93s">Not</a> only in our community, but the whole homeless situation as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9026.875s">So</a> Representative Christine Barber is actually working on an amendment to <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9033.329s">this</a> year's budget to really look at it and create a committee at the state level on looking at how vouchers are given out, maybe a district-wide list of students, and really trying to place <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9049.327s">families</a> close to where children go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9053.991s">I</a> had the opportunity to meet with her again this week, and Mrs. Skerry was able to come to the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9060.896s">And</a> I'll be meeting with her and maybe speaking there about homelessness. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9067.441s">I</a> know that the superintendent presented us a few weeks, maybe two months ago, with an amount of like $71,000 the district had paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9076.287s">for</a> homeless transportation at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9078.609s">I</a> don't know what it is at this point, and I know it's growing every day and the cost of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9082.691s">And</a> I really want to take an active role in being proactive with those funds and keeping people in their homes rather than paying for them to be housed and transported to school after they've been presented homeless. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9097.201s">So</a> I just wanted to give you an update on that and to let you know that work is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9102.704s">I'll</a> continue to update you as things progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9108.627s">The</a> rep was going to put our notes together and write up the amendment and send it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9121.832s">school</a> vacation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9123.713s">So</a> there might be a little bit of delay in some of the progress with this, the bill that we were talking about previously, and this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9133.118s">But</a> we are moving forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/b-cJrtai7oA&t=9135.559s">And</a> the superintendent's been nice enough to offer to provide me some more data, so that way we can really help the homeless children, not only in the city of Medford, but in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and their families as well.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=332.291s">That's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=333.472s">I</a> hope someday all our schools can get breakfast for us, too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=793.699s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=794.92s">Um,</a> through you to the superintendent, when we voted for the park, one of our, one of my colleagues had mentioned that we voted for our schools to take pen and pencil. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=805.43s">Is</a> the Andrews taking it electronically and do we need to revote if that's the case?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=834.428s">I</a> think that we voted for a pen-and-pen paper, so I think we might have to re-vote in order for that to happen.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=849.372s">I</a> think we should.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=853.534s">I</a> agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=854.034s">And</a> if we have a principal with that expertise and willing to take that on, and then we can determine what we need as a school department to move forward to have all of our tests done this way, I think it's a really good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=869.622s">But</a> I just want to make sure that we follow the procedures and the will of the school committee as directed is carried out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=877.826s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=879.787s">So</a> I would like to make a motion at this time to allow the Iandros School to take the park test using computers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1158.592s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1160.233s">It's</a> about items that we request. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1163.076s">Can</a> I make a motion at this point to put that on our agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1168.079s">Requested</a> items and any items that are tabled so that way they're a list of things every week and that way when someone requests something it's on the list and as we receive those documents it would come off the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1182.851s">It's</a> much easier to track.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1880.489s">I</a> just want to thank you for all your hard work in taking <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1884.768s">us</a> to these great opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1886.852s">I</a> know you've brought in a huge amount of grant funds already for our vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1894.144s">I</a> appreciate the work of yourself and your staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1897.927s">The</a> school looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1898.988s">I</a> was up there recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1900.85s">All</a> the colors do look great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1902.892s">And</a> I hope that someone pays attention and sees our need and comes and really gives us money to help us build this, because this is a dream come true. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1913.481s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=1914.261s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2444.075s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2447.476s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2448.577s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2450.077s">Do</a> we have any cost estimates of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2454.988s">through</a> you, Madam Mayor, to the superintendent, what the estimated cost of all of this is gonna be and how we're funding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2465.737s">I</a> just want it to be clear and out there so all questions are answered.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2479.611s">So</a> there's no cost to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2481.792s">So</a> that way, it's on record that this isn't coming out of the school-specific budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2488.295s">It's</a> a program that's going to generate education and value to both our school and to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2497.965s">And</a> I think it's a great program for our students and a great educational value because there are a lot of jobs that we can send people out and a lot of students will study this forward in college as well as use it as a technical skill if they choose not to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2515.123s">So</a> I think it's a great opportunity for both the school district as well as the city as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2522.144s">I</a> know at some point it's not gonna be just the school committee that decides on all of this and we're gonna have to work either with the city council or bring it forward to them after we do our share. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2535.847s">Is</a> that correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2842.0s">So...</a> Point of information, Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2848.198s">So</a> today was the deadline for registering for the April 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2853.201s">So</a> you may just want to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2854.721s">It's</a> wide open. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2857.282s">I</a> called today just to register to make sure that I had space. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2860.904s">But</a> that's what the brochure says. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2863.805s">So</a> if there is more room, we should let people know.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2867.887s">they</a> should at least call and register that they're coming and that they plan to attend and which of the five speakers they want to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/jdwHjtwlKYA&t=2878.253s">So</a> it's just helpful to them for planning purposes for Saturday.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2329.127s">Also,</a> we talked about on that evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2331.518s">about</a> the possibility of the children Skyping in to some of the things that were happening at the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2338.26s">Did</a> any of that take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2341.86s">Do</a> you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2357.933s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2358.793s">I'm</a> at least glad that they got that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2361.654s">And</a> maybe there is some more local opportunities that we can provide for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2365.615s">But</a> I'm at least glad that they got that, because it would have been very disappointing to me if they didn't get anything that week when they were so excited about this trip.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2381.388s">And</a> that's what I want to see, children advocating for what they need and what they were hoping to get, because that's what we raised them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2389.216s">So</a> I'm really happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2390.318s">I</a> agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2391.819s">I</a> don't believe that, I think this was an extenuating situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2396.524s">I</a> believe us helping out in this one time, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2401.137s">is</a> appropriate at 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2403.619s">I</a> also believe that we need to tell future parents about this situation that came about, and that the school committee will not be in the same position to help parents out financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2415.226s">So</a> I second the motion that's on the floor to have us pay for 50% at this time, and just to make sure that after a trip is canceled, maybe they have a follow up meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2430.344s">just</a> to go over with the parents, OK, we're sorry this didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2434.886s">This</a> is what's happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2436.587s">You</a> need to contact the insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2439.148s">This</a> is how you do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2440.128s">This</a> is the contact information. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2442.269s">And</a> maybe a follow-up meeting would have been helpful, rather than just a call about the cancellation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2448.472s">So</a> those are my suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2449.872s">That's</a> where I'm at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2450.853s">And</a> I'm sorry it was canceled for the students, but I hope that the little that they did get brought them some joy and happiness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=2458.556s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3714.92s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3716.241s">I</a> just want to comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3717.962s">I</a> graduated from St. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3718.962s">Clemens,</a> so I know a lot of the alumni. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3722.164s">And</a> I know there is a push to try to raise funds to keep the school open. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3727.487s">I</a> know they're doing fundraising and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3730.789s">I</a> don't know how successful it will be, but I just wanted you to at least have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3740.542s">They</a> are keeping their preschool open, and they are keeping their high school open at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3746.645s">So</a> I know that it's going to be hard for them not to have those schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3751.588s">And</a> I think part of it is because we're doing such a wonderful job in here, in Medford, that a lot of those children have already come back to the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=3760.637s">So</a> I want to welcome them as well as we can, but I also want to be sensitive that we don't want to rush them out if there is a play for them to stay open.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4274.811s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4274.971s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4275.611s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4276.512s">Thank</a> you for a great report, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4278.533s">I</a> just noticed, though, the building grounds in the athletic department, their totals are rising a little quicker than the rest of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4286.095s">So</a> they're at like 85% rather than 65%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4288.857s">I</a> just want to make sure we're on track and that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4294.718s">that</a> they won't be over towards the end of the school year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4314.001s">Just</a> checking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4315.002s">It's</a> just, um, just want to keep an eye on those, those line items and make sure that we don't have to pull funds from other areas for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4322.604s">Thank</a> you so much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4425.421s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4426.182s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4427.983s">I</a> spoke to the superintendent about this this morning as well as the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4431.466s">It</a> came to my attention through many phone calls in the last 24 hours that the company called the Middlesex Reds baseball organization <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4444.004s">were</a> advertising on their website, and I want to read to you what they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4450.067s">This</a> is a quote from their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4451.628s">This</a> past Sunday, February 21, the 13U and 17U junior reds held part of their practices inside the new batting cage facility located inside Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4463.415s">The</a> teams had part of their practice take place in the inside the new facility while also taking advantage of the warm weather and using the turf fields behind Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4473.546s">The</a> entire program is excited about the new facility to go along with all the other amenities that is offered in and around Memphit High School that the Reds use as their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4485.771s">Facilities</a> such as a large gymnasium that can hold 90 foot and 70 foot infield and two batting cages, two turf fields with lights, and now a brand new batting cage facility with three full-size tunnels and two smaller tunnels for short, soft toss drills. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4503.654s">Red</a> staff will be looking to add programs for all ages in the new facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4508.997s">So</a> stay tuned to this site and on our Facebook page for updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4513.239s">So</a> not only did they use our facility without prior approval, they are calling it the home of the Middlesex Reds baseball organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4523.003s">In</a> addition to that, they did make some notification that they used some of our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4531.087s">I</a> think, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4532.935s">I</a> can't remember exactly which park it might have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4536.056s">Is</a> it Morrissey Park? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4538.017s">They</a> made comment of using that park as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4542.338s">And</a> then later, right before I left for school committee, I got another call that this company has been using our facility for the last four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4551.541s">I</a> personally don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4554.542s">If</a> this is a new contract, it hasn't been brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4558.518s">I'll</a> let the superintendent speak for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4560.878s">When</a> I saw this, I was really upset, because we haven't even let our own students use this facility yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4567.62s">And</a> then we want to look at maybe community teams using it prior to going out to companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4572.921s">This</a> company advertises here a fee of $950, and I don't believe that's the whole fee for their season. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4579.902s">I</a> think that's just like a small fee for a small pot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4582.882s">I'm</a> not sure of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4584.683s">I</a> don't know what. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4586.183s">I</a> didn't call them and ask them their pricing, but this is a for-profit company that's already been in our batting cages, according to them, prior to us even using them or cutting a ribbon to open them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4597.268s">So</a> I'm gonna pass the floor to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4600.81s">This</a> is what warranted those two motions that I just put onto the floor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4823.885s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4825.426s">So</a> I would like a report to the school committee about that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4828.729s">I</a> would also like an audit of all facilities, what we're renting them for, how much we're renting for, who's renting for them, how's the money getting brought to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4837.676s">I</a> want an overview of all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4839.758s">I</a> also believe, and I'm sorry, but I know a lot of people aren't going to like this, but I really think that there needs to be a separation between our athletics and our community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4850.736s">Because</a> the athletic department should have to schedule things so that they're guaranteed their time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4855.899s">And</a> then the rental piece has to be handled separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4859.441s">I</a> really think that merging the two is not in the best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4864.963s">I</a> think there are funds that are potential income that aren't <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4870.28s">being</a> brought into the community, into the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4873.543s">So</a> I really want to look at that this year at our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4877.146s">I</a> know it's a cost to add a different person to take on, but it's two jobs, and it's two almost full-time jobs now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4884.151s">We</a> have a lot more facilities than we used to throughout. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4887.634s">We</a> have the fields, we have the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4890.513s">We</a> have the new batting cages now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4892.875s">This</a> is a lot to run and schedule and bring in those funds, as well as run the whole athletic department for the whole district, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4904.277s">I</a> just think it's time for us to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4907.578s">We've</a> been talking about community schools, I've been asking about money coming in, how we're utilizing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4912.92s">I</a> think they could be utilized more, they could be open to the public more, more classes could be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4917.402s">But</a> we can't have one person doing all of this work and expect it to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4922.762s">to</a> things not slip through. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4925.323s">And</a> he's done an incredible job for our community, especially in all the years that we could not have running what we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4933.727s">I've</a> seen the men out in the fields chasing geese away to make sure that the kids didn't have a safe place to play at 6 in the morning when I used to walk the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4943.911s">I</a> mean, this is a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4946.632s">And</a> we need to look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4948.373s">As</a> a school committee, we need to look at this and make sure it's fair for everybody throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4952.954s">And</a> the use is for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4955.836s">This</a> place is called the Waltham Reds before. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4959.739s">Now</a> it's the Middlesex Reds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4961.56s">They're</a> based out of Waltham, but they're calling Method their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4964.642s">Like,</a> what else is going on that we don't know about? <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4967.564s">And</a> we need to look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4968.965s">And</a> we need to have these answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4970.626s">And</a> I want them brought here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dwzQ8HIvdTQ&t=4972.167s">So</a> I'm requesting that audit to be completed.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=253.962s">We</a> have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=256.063s">When</a> was the last time it was updated?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=268.765s">So</a> will you be updating that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=269.926s">We're</a> comfortable.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=283.569s">And</a> did we do an auto call to a reverse call to our parents?

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=299.049s">That's</a> great, I'm glad to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=301.65s">Communication</a> is key in these situations when safety of people's children are involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=307.191s">So</a> I think that that should be one of our main things when we have this situation going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=311.772s">And</a> then parents can make choices based on what they're comfortable with as well.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=999.678s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1002.359s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1003.059s">Um,</a> first of all, this is, I love the programming and I love preparing our children to be citizens of the world and not just, um, in educating them in that manner as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1013.519s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1014.78s">Is</a> this based in their curriculum throughout the school day, or is it certain classes that it's happening in, or is it a group after school that's taking the lead on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1024.447s">I'm</a> not really clear on that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1068.112s">So</a> who's taken the empathy unit that's already been developed?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1076.986s">So</a> the English, all the English classes?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1117.04s">So</a> to continue funding, I was talking to Mr. Skoker a little bit about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1122.764s">In</a> order for this program to continue, <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1125.192s">What</a> are you hoping? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1126.313s">How</a> are we going to fund this program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1162.515s">And</a> I had one final, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1165.703s">So</a> your event that's being taken place on Saturday, April 2nd, I think it's a great event for this whole community to hear really loud and very clearly that this keynote speaker is here to help anyone who has parents and teachers and anybody working with anyone throughout the community that has ideas to be proactive steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1190.582s">for</a> people and resources for people who are dealing with anyone who is in addiction or, you know, possibility of ever becoming an addicted personality. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1203.326s">So</a> I really want to emphasize Saturday, April 2nd, 1215 to 5 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1208.608s">You</a> have professional schedule to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1211.448s">I</a> know high school students are going to be speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1213.913s">I</a> have a suggestion to contact Cheryl Delaforo. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1220.137s">She</a> works with parents, and I have her contact if you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1226.661s">She</a> runs a parents group on Tuesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1229.702s">So</a> I really believe that they would love to come if they were invited, and that they could be a great resource, plus the program that's happening could be a great resource for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1240.228s">So</a> I think it could really work well for both. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1243.4s">So</a> I really encourage that piece and if I can help facilitate that in any way, please let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1249.323s">And</a> thank you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1250.264s">I</a> think this is a wonderful program for the students of MedFit and the community as a whole.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1874.757s">My</a> question was very similar to my colleagues, but I also wanted to know if we were sending this flyer home at least to our middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1881.621s">I</a> know it's expensive to do that, but even if we backpack it through the mayor to the superintendent, can we approve that to happen for this to go to our middle school parents in backpacks?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1894.009s">It'll</a> go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1894.87s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=1906.001s">Terrific.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4192.079s">So</a> I have a few comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4194.82s">First</a> of all, on the page which says, Title I students who are rated level III must inform parents of this rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4203.724s">So</a> I'm assuming that the district is sending out letters to all Title I students at the Roberts only, or does that mean the whole district? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4211.873s">Because</a> now the district is a level three school.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4229.978s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4230.218s">I</a> didn't know of all districts in the school because now the whole district is a level three district. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4236.683s">Correct?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4240.426s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4240.746s">So</a> we only have three out of four. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4241.927s">So</a> any Title I school could possibly need a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4245.365s">But</a> my guess and interpretation that it's just the Roberts because of their school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4250.87s">That's</a> initially what I believe she said. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4253.452s">So,</a> well, we have explained away a lot of what this test and the changes, but what we haven't talked about really is that this test is given and these ratings are for everybody in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4269.205s">So</a> we are only one school district dealing with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4272.919s">But</a> we are compared to those other school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4275.845s">And</a> the level three, according to this paper, it says you're in the lowest performing 20% of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4283.613s">That's</a> concerning to me in a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4285.836s">Number</a> one, I want to be, I want to take corrective action if we need to and get more help to the Roberts so we aren't a level three school district wide. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4296.107s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4296.668s">Whether</a> or not we like the way they, they put the formulas together and how they change it is, is one issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4305.42s">But</a> the other issue, we own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4307.282s">We're</a> a level three school. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4309.165s">That</a> means when someone moves into our community, they research schools, this is what they're going to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4316.554s">All</a> right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4317.155s">Also,</a> we are way better than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4319.979s">We</a> owe it to these children to look at what we're doing correctly and where we need to improve. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4326.665s">Not</a> make reasons why this doesn't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4331.248s">Well,</a> it does count. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4333.07s">And</a> we can't decide that it doesn't, because it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4335.572s">And</a> this is our tool that we're being evaluated on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4339.115s">We</a> need to do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4341.237s">And</a> that's our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4343.158s">So</a> I own what it says and I want to work together with our administrators, our teachers, and our staff as a whole to make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4351.823s">So</a> that way next year we're not having this conversation again. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4355.105s">I</a> don't know if that means that we need to have an academic committee meeting and just really go through some of these data and really look at our middle and elementary schools about where they are and how we can help them <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4368.633s">perform</a> better on any test that the state decides to give us, in any way they mean to jumble how we need to prove that our children are doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4379.416s">I</a> want to make sure we're doing that next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4382.596s">OK,</a> we have the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4384.277s">Let's</a> move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4385.257s">Let's</a> fix it for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4386.837s">Let's</a> do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4387.918s">So</a> through you to the superintendent, I'd like to schedule an academic affairs meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4393.299s">As</a> of right now, I was the committee chairperson until new committee <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4398.152s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4398.572s">So</a> I would like to call that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4400.013s">I'd</a> like to make a motion for that committee to, to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4402.654s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4404.514s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=4405.615s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6422.29s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6422.851s">I</a> just wanted to say that another significant change was when we don't have to send our freshmen there for their freshman year. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6433.076s">We</a> get to keep them in Medford and that's a new change within this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6441.693s">And</a> once children are in our, you know, stay within their districts and make friends, they're less likely to leave them to go somewhere else unless they have a vision in their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6451.497s">And</a> then of course, if we don't offer it, we're going to find them the right program. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6456.279s">But</a> that's really a significant change coming forward.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6494.153s">I</a> believe, if I remember correctly, you led the charge in that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6497.034s">I</a> certainly did.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6593.668s">Just</a> in regards to the whole business, I know it's not on here, but can we request an update on the crossing guard at the Fells? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6601.153s">Where</a> we are with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6602.514s">We</a> were- On the Fells? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6603.734s">Yes,</a> we were- Was it DCR? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6606.196s">Yes,</a> it was in the superintendent's office who was looking into <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6612.593s">reinstating</a> a crossing guard that had been removed from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6616.317s">And</a> I'm just requesting that an update, and maybe at our next meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/nRt_3AXXILY&t=6627.488s">Aye.</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U/2025-03-21_-NVTJszOr_U.html">Medford, MA School Committee - Jan. 25, 2016 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=798.596s">Turn</a> off your phone and put it back on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1462.101s">Could</a> we send a letter thanking the managers or the owners of the Medical Inn Mall for their past five years, allowing us to have our children's exhibits there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1474.604s">And</a> I also want to thank <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1477.483s">No,</a> no, but it was at Middle Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1479.764s">And</a> also, I just want to thank you for your commitment to doing this for our students and our community, so our community gets to see the beautiful work that children create during their school day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1493.212s">It's</a> another way that we get to show the community what's happening in our schools and the beautiful things that we create through our day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1503.157s">Thank</a> you very much for your time and your energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1505.499s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1523.817s">Motion</a> for approval.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1528.839s">I</a> had a question on page 13, National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1532.48s">It</a> says rink expense for the amount of $12,971. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1535.161s">Is</a> that for our use of the rink for both our hockey teams or is that something else?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1557.177s">Oh,</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=1557.677s">I</a> just hadn't seen that before in a budget.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2219.999s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2222.86s">I</a> just have a question how this relates to the journeys program that we recently purchased and how we're going to use both programs.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2253.346s">So</a> you're using both programs at the same time?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2265.048s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2265.428s">I</a> just want to make sure that we're utilizing the program that we just recently purchased, because we really want to give that program time to build from our really beginning foundation grades up <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2278.449s">because</a> I believe that that program will help raise our scores for both MCAS, but not even that, but will help, you know, all of our students in vocabulary and in so many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2289.433s">And</a> if every student across the district is learning from the same program, I really like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2294.575s">So</a> that way, as they get to different grade levels where they, they mingle together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2300.316s">they've</a> all had the same basics and that goes smoothly.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2320.431s">That's</a> terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2321.272s">I'm</a> really happy to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2322.632s">And</a> I think it's a great opportunity for us to learn more.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2341.18s">And</a> I love that the classroom teaches directly at $500 to get <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2347.097s">what</a> they need for classroom supplies, and you get to choose what those are?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2416.976s">I'd</a> love to come by. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2417.957s">I</a> would love to come by. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2420.038s">I'll</a> schedule that soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=2421.459s">Sure.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3457.168s">Us</a> too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3458.229s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3459.711s">I</a> just had a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3461.252s">Mr.</a> Sawyer agreed to take this position on a part-time basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3464.941s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3466.242s">That</a> with the other teaching time that other teachers can provide would be enough to open this?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3521.379s">And</a> how are we about, how are we going about recruiting for that position? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3525.18s">Because</a> if we're going to need it in the near future, are we contacting any colleges with people with that major?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3583.467s">My</a> other question is interest from students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3586.948s">Do</a> you see that this shop will be <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3591.637s">build</a> an interest through the next few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3594.598s">I</a> know it has to build, like it goes through just the freshmen and sophomores taken as exploratory and then it's more like the third year that students actually are going to be enrolling in the shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=3606.044s">Am</a> I correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4102.618s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4108.411s">With</a> this program, you take classes at Bunk Hill Community College, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4113.259s">How</a> do you get there?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4117.866s">Okay,</a> and is it during the school day? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4120.49s">Tuesdays,</a> it starts tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4122.555s">And</a> how many classes are you taking? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4125.337s">And</a> what do you receive when you finish that program? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4134.421s">So</a> is that an LPN program?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4145.131s">And</a> I know that Bunker Hill is a two-year program that has an affiliation with UMass Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4149.973s">So</a> if you wanted to go for a four-year degree in nursing, that all your credits are then transferred from Bunker Hill onward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4158.698s">So</a> this is a really great opportunity for a lot of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4164.163s">not</a> just in nursing, but in the imaging field as well, because, you know, with all the baby boomers coming to age, you're going to be taking care of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4173.129s">There's</a> going to be plenty of people to do that for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4175.991s">And</a> this is a really great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4177.732s">I'm</a> so thrilled that Medford represented so well, and that your director has really initiated so many programs for the students at Alvo Vocational School. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4187.998s">I</a> could not be prouder. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4189.479s">And</a> I wish you nothing but the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4191.801s">And</a> I can't wait to see you on graduation.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4447.533s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4448.173s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4448.573s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4450.595s">Is</a> there any way that the children can actually go and see a house that one of the beds are being utilized in? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4458.421s">Like</a> at the end or at the beginning to help <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4461.177s">them</a> understand the impact that they're having on someone's life.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4504.31s">Will</a> they actually see the child?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4508.232s">And</a> they'll get it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4521.719s">That's</a> great, because I really feel like if you teach children community service at a young age, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4528.666s">They</a> teach everybody they meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4530.887s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4531.527s">And</a> it just becomes a better place to live for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4535.028s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=4535.828s">This</a> is a great program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5130.837s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5131.777s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5132.618s">This</a> brought to mind my request for what the cost, the report I requested last week, two weeks ago when we were here, about the cost increase to move our part-time kindergarten aides to full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5149.544s">I</a> know this evening when I asked you about it, you gave me an approximate number. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5156.186s">I'd</a> really like a cost report. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5157.706s">I</a> know Pat just left, but <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5159.727s">a</a> cost report, a budget of what it would look like if we were to change all of our part-time kindergarten age, especially based on the numbers that you gave us last school committee meeting about the class sizes in some of our kindergarten classrooms.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5265.632s">Okay,</a> as a follow-up too, I know that they're talking about looking at bigger preschool programs throughout the state of Massachusetts, and I'm sure in that conversation, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5276.529s">that</a> making sure that we have enough staffing for our K classes is also going to be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5283.651s">So</a> I don't see them cutting the K budget and increasing a preschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5289.013s">I</a> just don't see it happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5290.953s">Actually,</a> I'm meeting with some legislators this week, Thursday evening, and I'm going to discuss homeless transportation throughout the commonwealth with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5299.756s">And</a> the need for some changes in funding there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5302.058s">And</a> I'm also going to bring up this issue and tell them that the Medford Public Schools does offer kindergarten aides in our classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5310.044s">But</a> because they're not totally funding what we need them to fund for our kindergarten rooms, we're not looking for any of our legislatures that represent the city of Medford to vote in a way that would hurt us from losing any funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5324.194s">And</a> I expect them to represent us in the way and manner that our children, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5329.678s">need</a> for them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5331.559s">So</a> that's already on my agenda, and I don't want to dismiss this light item in next year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5338.004s">This</a> has been a priority of this committee for a few years now, and I want to let you know that this is something I'm going to be looking for in our budget for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5347.71s">I'm</a> just putting it out there, and I know there's a lot of committee members that feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5351.692s">We've</a> been doing this for quite a few years now, and I'm just setting my goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5358.036s">This</a> is a goal for next year for the Metropolitan Schools as far as I'm concerned as a school committee member.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5467.017s">Mayor</a> Burke, just to follow up, as a committee member, I am reaching out to state representatives to tell them how I feel as a representative of this community and how I expect them to vote when this does come up on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5481.023s">So</a> I encourage other members to either join me or to make their own phone calls to do that as well because I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5489.246s">If</a> they don't hear from us, they assume that this is fine, and this is not fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5494.812s">The</a> preschool and kindergarten and K through 2, that's the foundation of our education, just like a foundation of a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5501.498s">If</a> you don't have a good foundation, the house will fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5504.661s">And</a> so we need to start, and I know Matthew was one of the first full-time
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5512.807s">Right,</a> and I want to continue being a leader in that area, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5516.289s">I'm</a> going to stay on this for our budget meetings all the way through until we get this approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5523.173s">And</a> just wanted to give you a fear warning.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5779.686s">On</a> the motion, I'm going to get a clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5782.609s">Just</a> so you're aware, charter schools are public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5786.372s">I</a> understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=5787.172s">So</a> you just can't say that, though, because a lot of people don't understand that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6407.12s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6407.9s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6408.701s">Um,</a> first of all, I think it's great that we offer that and I applaud your creativity to be able to keep offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6415.925s">I'm</a> really glad to see these programs being offered to our eighth grade students, especially with the park coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6421.508s">Um,</a> I think it's a tremendous, how many students do you think that will be receiving letters for, um, the prep program prior to the park?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6483.838s">I</a> have another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6485.609s">So</a> sometimes families travel during breaks and they can't get their children there on Saturdays and other things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6495.896s">So</a> is there any way we could provide an online program? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6499.619s">I</a> know it would take a while in development, but if we had that to offer, like if someone needed to take one of these programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6507.345s">I</a> know that some of our teachers in the past created online classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6514.165s">So</a> I don't know if anybody would be interested in trying to do this program in an online capacity so we could reach more students and have more participation and really make sure our students are prepared for these exams.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6561.653s">Because</a> if there's like a tutorial, and this week you work on this, and you do the homework, and even if there's online chat time with a teacher, then, you know, like if you have a question, I really don't understand this math concept, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6574.763s">And</a> you could still meet and talk to a teacher, but you don't have to be present in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6580.686s">It</a> might get more people invested, and that's how learning is really moving towards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6589.409s">So,</a> I mean, if we could offer it in this way to help remediate any kind of lapse in education, you know, like certain goals, then I think it's something great to look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6603.083s">through</a> you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6604.424s">I</a> know the superintendent started an online blog and he was using more technical skills and this is a great opportunity to pilot like learning to be more used through the internet, through online programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6619.951s">I</a> know we're looking at that at some of our <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6624.115s">the</a> Curtis Huff School as well for students that can't actually get into the building, but they could still get to their curriculum and still meet their educational requirements to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6635.16s">I</a> know we started to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6637.241s">Could</a> you look into this and see if there's a way, not only with this program, with the other programs, and give us an update of how we're moving forward with that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6678.448s">Not</a> only that, I'm talking more about
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6687.854s">But</a> also creating the class and what's involved in that and how we're going to give teachers time to create these classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6697.165s">It's</a> great for me to say, oh, this would be great if this was online and the teacher taught it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6701.729s">But</a> that takes time to create that curriculum and to put it in that format for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6706.692s">So</a> not only the technology piece, but how we're encouraging our teachers to use that in their classrooms and outside of their classrooms to teach our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6715.699s">And</a> that's really where I want to know where Method is moving in the future for this, because that's how I see education really happening in the next 10 years.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6786.834s">So</a> I'm thinking maybe, you know how we bought the Chromebooks and stuff like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6791.778s">So</a> for a class similar to this, if we could maybe look forward to maybe next year offering it to some of our eighth graders in that way, and it be a pilot program, and how does it work, and did they do the work, and seeing how ready we are or not ready we are to proceed with bigger <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6812.49s">online</a> teaching and type things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=6815.691s">I</a> would like to see us at least pilot some type of class in that, in that, like maybe we need to have a curriculum meeting and subcommittee meeting.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7079.164s">That's</a> why I suggested using the Chromebooks that we've already purchased, so that it's not a hardship to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7085.648s">We</a> do have some technology in place that we could provide for this smaller group of people taking this class. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7095.973s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7096.994s">Great</a> program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7097.714s">Motion</a> to accept the report and place it on file.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7166.872s">Okay,</a> so I have the graph that you gave us last week of how many students are at each. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7176.819s">And</a> then, so sixth grade at the end was on this graph says we have 177 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7184.725s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7185.725s">And</a> on this graph for ELA, there's 20 in each grouping, so that would be 84, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7196.021s">Six</a> students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7198.762s">A</a> side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7199.402s">A</a> side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7200.023s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7200.783s">So</a> that's.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7208.846s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7209.866s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7210.306s">It's</a> pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7211.047s">Yeah,</a> I just wanted to double check with the numbers because they just look differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7215.448s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7216.449s">You're</a> welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7217.589s">Motion</a> to accept.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7788.999s">Are</a> there any questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7790.679s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7790.859s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7791.54s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7793.34s">Through</a> you to the superintendent, when we were listing the building and ground improvements, I know that we had talked about changing the lighting at the Curtis Tufts School, and Alicia Hunt sent us an email with <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7809.53s">some</a> figures and figuring out how we could budget that throughout the next three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7816.035s">Have</a> you had a chance to look at that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7892.006s">So</a> my understanding through that email and through the research that she has done is that we could take <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7900.563s">alone</a> on the decrease in the amount it would cost us in electricity, and the decreased amount would pay the amount of the loan to replace the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7909.886s">And</a> I know that we were talking about just the Curtis, but she was also mentioning the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7915.308s">So</a> I'm just wondering, it might not actually cost us any dollars out of pocket, and that's why I'm bringing it up rather than waiting for a capital improvement plan.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7925.698s">It's</a> much more comfortable for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7926.759s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7927.62s">She</a> sent us an email over the holidays, so that's why I just wanted to follow up and make sure that we're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7933.785s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7935.146s">Mayor</a> Burke.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=7993.782s">So,</a> excuse me, Mayor Burke, I had another question regarding our homeless students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8001.133s">Do</a> all of our homeless students currently have transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8004.674s">Yes,</a> they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8005.614s">I'm</a> so happy to hear that because throughout the Commonwealth, there's a shortage in drivers for homeless students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8011.656s">And</a> if you call a lot of the companies that they just don't have enough drivers because I personally just was trying to get a driver for a student at my school and it took a lot of time, over a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8024.851s">to</a> find a company that had availability to go to the town I needed to transport her. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8029.455s">And</a> it's an extreme cost, and this increase of 23.7% is telling of the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8038.322s">Everybody</a> thinks that we're in really great shape economically throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8044.206s">Well,</a> there are a lot of families that aren't in such great state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8047.429s">23.7%</a> increase in our cost, <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8051.99s">of</a> transporting homeless students. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8054.131s">That's</a> not housing them, that's not feeding them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8057.273s">We're</a> paying $70,000 so far this year just to get them to school every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8064.437s">Again,</a> not feeding them, not housing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8066.679s">And</a> I think it's a bigger problem that our commonwealth needs to look at because <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8072.562s">If</a> we weren't traveling them so far, we could even pay rent for them to live in that community, and it would save the Commonwealth money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8080.007s">So</a> I actually had called some legislators about this months ago, and this just reconfirmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8086.832s">So</a> I'm pushing that forward, and I'm meeting with people this week to just talk about what we can do as a Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8095.277s">Maybe</a> after I meet with them, I'll be happy to speak with you about it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8142.738s">Also,</a> I just want to thank your administration that provides and does this work to make sure that our homeless students have rights to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8152.321s">Yeah,</a> Abraham. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8153.661s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8154.281s">It's</a> such an important role, and it takes a lot of time and effort, because it has to go to be bidded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8160.163s">And</a> it's really, it's very involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8163.244s">And</a> parents call every day, because they really need those rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8168.45s">And</a> it's not always easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8171.374s">So</a> I really appreciate all the work done to make sure that all of our students in Method have a way to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8178.083s">And</a> I really appreciate that time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8179.825s">And</a> thank you for this report, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-NVTJszOr_U&t=8181.567s">Thank</a> you for the report.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21__38fWkPIfZM/2025-03-21__38fWkPIfZM.html">Medford School Committee - Dec. 7, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=75.904s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=77.986s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=272.515s">I</a> think this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=273.375s">I</a> love partnerships within the community and some kids probably need a new toothbrush and don't even realize they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=279.781s">So</a> this is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=280.782s">Thank</a> you for doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=282.163s">Did</a> they approach you or did we approach them?

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=581.192s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=584.095s">I'll</a> let the superintendent introduce it and talk about it and then I have a few questions.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=646.506s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=648.948s">Okay,</a> first I have a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=651.15s">I</a> see that this application was dated November 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=659.385s">Yeah,</a> well, it's stated here, it was created November 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=663.393s">And</a> I see the application and I really, moving forward, I would love to see this come before us before an application is put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=671.871s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=686.414s">But</a> on the other hand, it's just a comment that I'd like to see it happen in an appropriate fashion and appropriate timeline to come to us before they start an application unless it was something that they were going to miss out on. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=698.932s">But</a> if that's the exception, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=701.174s">But</a> it can't be the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=702.855s">OK?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=703.476s">So</a> that was my first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=704.857s">What</a> is the cost of this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=707.299s">How</a> will Marlden pay for their pod? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=709.621s">How</a> will they pay for the insurance and the transportation fees? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=713.584s">How</a> many Medford High School students out of the 14 that tried out are high school students? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=719.168s">How</a> many of them are junior high? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=720.749s">I</a> just want some information about what's going on with the program.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=769.013s">What's</a> the amount of students that are usually on this team?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=801.241s">And</a> my question is, how much does this program cost on an annual basis?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=814.617s">So,</a> and what about our liability, having Malden students, I mean, is our insurance gonna cover them when we're transporting them? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=822.94s">Is</a> it gonna cover them when they're on the, I just wanna make sure we make informed decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=827.981s">I</a> mean, I love, I grew up as a hockey family, and so I love it, and I'm more than happy to provide this program to the girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=838.244s">Maybe</a> we need to do more outreach or something, but I just wanna make sure the school system's liability.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=876.079s">I</a> make a motion to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=877.56s">I</a> don't know if someone already did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=879.38s">Okay.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=920.292s">We</a> did.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=923.154s">That's</a> accurate information, Mr. Bell.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2836.938s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2837.919s">First</a> of all, I want to express that I, too, like my colleague, agree that they did what they wanted to do, Ann Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2846.225s">And</a> they took all of those questions, and they just put it under a new title. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2850.468s">But</a> the only difference is that we did get the Massachusetts framework questions also included in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2856.532s">So</a> that helps the students in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2858.954s">So</a> that's the only piece different. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2861.195s">than</a> just doing the park that I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2864.178s">And</a> after speaking to all my colleagues, you know, that I work in a different school district, and we all feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2872.385s">It's</a> just their way of getting park in place in all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2876.849s">But</a> we did win a little victory by getting our frameworks also included and not just the Common Core, which I think is a win for Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2886.717s">So</a> that's the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2887.878s">And</a> as far as accountability goes, we're not accountable this year, which is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2893.319s">And</a> that's also the carrot dangling in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2896.4s">Hey,</a> if you do what we want you to do, which is take back, we won't hold you accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2901.982s">So</a> they've given us a free ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2903.402s">And</a> I didn't like it when they did it last year, and I spoke about it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2907.123s">And</a> I actually said, unless people stand up against them, they're going to keep doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2912.898s">So</a> I don't like that bribery piece, and that's how I look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2915.819s">I</a> don't think there's any other way to describe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2917.759s">I</a> just call it the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2920.52s">Is</a> there any cost difference by doing this to the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2923.861s">I</a> know that the state of Massachusetts pays, what, $37 million on testing on an annual basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2929.742s">Boy,</a> what could we do with that money to educate the children in this commonwealth? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2934.683s">if</a> we weren't spending $37 million every year just to test these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2942.206s">Boy,</a> we would have nice books. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2943.646s">We'd</a> have foreign language in our middle schools full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2948.568s">I</a> could think of 100 things off the top of my head that we as a school district could do if we could get our hands on that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2956.23s">$37</a> million. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2958.471s">I'll</a> never forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2959.251s">It's</a> in my brain forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2961.552s">$37</a> million, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2964.113s">pays</a> each year just to give a test to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2967.655s">It's</a> amazing how we spend money and how it doesn't get to the children's education, it goes to their evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2974.71s">And</a> kids that miss it by two points don't get a high school diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2978.992s">It</a> kills me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2979.812s">It</a> bothers me. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2980.692s">It's</a> not the right way to judge children. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2983.713s">And</a> that's just, I'm sorry, I get off on a soapbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2986.654s">So</a> if there's no cost difference, and there's no accountability, and we're going to park anyway, I vote to give the children, and I hate saying this, <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=2997.189s">the</a> park tests and I motion to approve and would go with the superintendent's recommendation, even though I was huge, huge opponent of it last year, Mr. Superintendent on that motion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4120.345s">I'm</a> Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4121.306s">Sorry,</a> Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4123.426s">You</a> do great work trying to get this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4125.307s">And</a> I know the bureaucracy with DCR and trying to get a whole room right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4129.268s">It's</a> really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4130.408s">Appreciate</a> all the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4131.889s">But</a> if we can't get a Fellsway, I mean a DCR crossing guide, can we put a MAPFIC crossing guide there? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4139.331s">Can</a> we do that?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4419.5s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4420.58s">Back</a> to transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4422.621s">Are</a> we adding a bus at the middle school? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4425.357s">I'm</a> sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4425.877s">Are</a> we adding a bus additional day at the middle school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4443.408s">And</a> I'm assuming we have enough need for after school homework help and time with teachers to warrant that additional bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4452.474s">And</a> I'm really glad that that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4455.608s">Thank</a> you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4457.689s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4458.089s">Thank</a> you for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4458.91s">That's</a> the first one. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4460.431s">Um,</a> the increase in the cost of the rent for the Japanese school is an increase of a flat $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4467.555s">Did</a> someone, I'm sure, but could you make sure that we charging them enough for the increase in the utilities that they're utilizing? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4478.021s">Do</a> they, do they use the pool? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4480.122s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4480.916s">Okay,</a> and the cost of the electricity was very high, so are we increasing it enough to warrant the usage of all those rooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4490.898s">Is</a> it an appropriate amount of an increase, or is it just a $10,000?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4505.794s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4506.174s">I</a> just want to make sure what maintenance and custodial staff and utilities that, you know, the costs that it costs us, we're still, we're still making the same profit margin.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4547.245s">Are</a> we negotiating rentals throughout the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4550.507s">And</a> what are we renting our buildings for? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4552.389s">What</a> are our gymnasiums getting? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4554.33s">That's</a> the kind of information I'd really like to see some kind of breakdown about.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4606.713s">So</a> I just want to make sure that we're consistent and fair throughout the community on every area of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4614.398s">Like</a> one area doesn't pay more for one gym than another area might pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4618.461s">I</a> would like to see a breakdown of who's renting it on a regular basis, what their fees are, whether it's, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/_38fWkPIfZM&t=4626.066s">We</a> have asked for that.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1933.36s">And</a> the director of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1936.388s">of</a> the vocational school, there were pictures of her with the sledgehammer, and her husband was there, and they were laying the tile floors, and they were like hands on, knee deep, and it was just like a whole board across the thing, and to see the progression of how that shop changed, it's just really everybody up there giving their all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1959.651s">It's</a> a great community atmosphere and it's very impressive and I'm very proud of what Medford has done in that over the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=1968.994s">It</a> just shows that we can do anything and everything when we work together.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pRisne0HuuA&t=2562.611s">I</a> think that's great, and I thank them for their service both to our country and to our school children.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1404.106s">Oh,</a> I'm thrilled to have this in front of us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1406.967s">I</a> have a beautiful big dog who's going to enjoy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1410.91s">We've</a> both been at both your other parks that you've designed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1414.418s">I</a> find that the Somerville one is a little narrow.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1419.124s">Right,</a> and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1420.946s">And</a> the Ellington one is newer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1422.528s">I</a> can tell that it was done after the Somerville one because the features for the dogs are a little upgraded.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1476.169s">So</a> my other point is that we're here tonight just out of a courtesy, really, so that way you can show us where you were thinking of putting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1485.573s">And</a> the reason you're here is because it is so close to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1489.034s">But</a> seeing the demonstration and how far they are away, I'm sure most people in the community that want this for their dogs are going to be very, very careful and understand that the schools are close by. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1500.819s">So</a> I have no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1502.34s">I</a> love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1503.06s">I</a> do have to say, my dog doesn't like the stones as much as she likes the other elements, so just a little feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1512.324s">The</a> texture is an issue, maybe, yes.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1522.207s">Well,</a> just a little dog feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1524.348s">When</a> he first gets in, it takes him quite a while to get used to the pebbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=1529.132s">I</a> also was hoping to move this for approval with Mr. Skerry.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2467.962s">I</a> agree wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2469.423s">Um,</a> this is something that has touched my family directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2472.505s">I</a> lost my brother 14 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2474.346s">Um,</a> and he was a heroin addict for a very long time before he was, um, he sustained very good life the last four years of his life on methadone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2484.992s">And,</a> um, we were glad to have him back because you lose, you lose, you lose that family member to the disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2493.517s">And</a> then, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2494.737s">My</a> family was lucky enough to have him back until he passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2497.979s">So</a> I am very glad that as a school system, that we are being proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2505.124s">And</a> that could save lives of not only our children, anyone in our school system, anyone we see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2513.088s">Let's</a> not wait for something to happen to someone's child, to someone's brother, to someone's daughter, to someone's sister, to someone's wife, to someone's husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2524.065s">best</a> people on the front line trained and let them carry Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2528.767s">I</a> am trained and I carry Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2530.889s">I</a> pulled it out of my bag just to show people in case anybody wanted to see what it looked like this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2537.752s">The</a> point that you didn't say that really stuck with me when I read through every bit of your literature, Tony, was addiction starts for 67% of people between the ages of 12 and 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2553.703s">Addiction</a> starts from junior high to high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2558.205s">That's</a> when this starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2560.266s">And</a> if we can get them then, we won't lose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2563.927s">We</a> won't lose our MEDFED children. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2566.228s">I</a> will not attend wakes from friends and family that I know for children again, like we were last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2573.191s">I</a> don't want to ever do that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2576.193s">Thank</a> you to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2577.453s">Thank</a> you to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2578.734s">I</a> want to see this implemented immediately, and I <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2582.05s">would</a> like to, um, propose that we work, we move this forward this evening and, um, approve this on the motion of this is the better debt.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2863.099s">Mr.</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2870.481s">I'd</a> like to congratulate our colleague, Robert Eminskieri, on his retirement, 33 years of commitment to the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2884.504s">What's</a> your job title?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2888.906s">Bureau</a> of Investigations?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=2894.758s">I'm</a> sure that a lot of people are in jail now because of this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4481.424s">Point</a> of information.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4486.906s">Just</a> so you know, there are community groups that are very active and are running a lot of events throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4492.889s">The</a> Method Against Addiction is a great one, and they've been educating the community, having kickball tournaments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4499.371s">They</a> had the memorial service last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4502.932s">really</a> active and present. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4505.255s">They</a> called me about an issue in a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4507.858s">Their</a> outreach has reached out to many families in need as well as families that didn't realize we had a problem in Brighton. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4515.585s">by</a> their publicity from their group is also educating people.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4551.0s">Thank</a> you, Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4552.821s">Going</a> back to how it relates to the schools for this point, I had a question about some of the curriculum, and I just wanted to be very clear, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4562.747s">How</a> are we teaching students that have a family member or a friend <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4567.256s">that</a> is using drugs or alcohol, how do they get help? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4573.16s">How</a> do they get comfortable enough to tell somebody that they need help dealing with it or their friend or their parent or whoever else, sibling in the household, whoever, they're living in this situation?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4621.912s">I</a> think we just really need to emphasize that even if they don't have a problem, if someone they know is, that they should really speak out and get them help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4630.177s">And</a> that has to be communicated over and over and over again.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4647.868s">Okay,</a> the other part of your data that I found extremely significant is more about the mental health of some of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4655.635s">And</a> it says here on page seven of seven in the packet, it says on the second one down, it says, at times I think I am no good at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4666.784s">58%</a> of high school females, that was alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4670.888s">More</a> than half of high school females. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4674.314s">said</a> yes to that, and then felt depressed or sad on most days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4679.987s">57%</a> of high school females. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4681.891s">This</a> to me is really sad.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4727.184s">I</a> mean, something to think about, that sometimes separating them by gender might be actually more helpful because they're more able to talk freely about... Or targeting these groups, because we're seeing an alarming amount of children feeling depressed and feeling like they're not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4742.972s">And</a> that was extremely alarming to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4745.233s">And</a> as someone in education, and as a committee, I think we should really provide services for <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4752.452s">somehow</a> come up with ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4753.893s">I</a> know we have in our own way by funding more Councilors and more people to address these issues in the school system this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4763.176s">I</a> mean, we made this a priority here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4765.877s">All</a> of my colleagues, the superintendent have really come through with, you know, giving more support to our students, but this is identifying who needs that support. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4775.161s">And</a> I just want that to happen.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4797.608s">This</a> is alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4799.049s">Oh,</a> definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4803.854s">something</a> immediate, because if half of our girls are feeling this way, this is an emergency situation in my mind, that we need team building or whatever we need, we need to do it, and we need to do it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4819.163s">We're</a> not in our middle school, this is saying our high school students.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4840.135s">Is</a> that up from last year?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4854.519s">Another</a> suggestion I have is when I was on the PTO up for Method High School, they brought in a lot of speakers in a lot of extracurricular that really were like the yellow dress and about dating violence and about different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4868.625s">And</a> if they knew that this was the issue, maybe they could help in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4873.847s">I</a> know if you contact Dan Rapucci, I'm sure she'd be willing to <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4877.508s">like</a> even change up what they do if they saw this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4881.789s">So</a> maybe presenting this to the PTO, especially at our high school, that's another way, like my colleague Ann Marie was saying, how we getting this to the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4891.511s">Maybe</a> there's a PTO night that this is presented, that we actually go where the parents are, even if it's 10 parents in that room and they can spread the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4900.974s">I</a> mean, I really think that she is right in that regard, that we have to get it to <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4906.413s">to</a> the students and to the parents.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4924.905s">And</a> maybe it could be the middle school and high school PTOs together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4928.747s">And</a> maybe you could have someone from a couple of the groups, like the parents group that Cheryl DellaFano <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4934.157s">and</a> have someone from Method Against Addiction and just have like a forum on it because if 58% of our girls are feeling like they're not valued or not important, that's huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4948.287s">That's</a> a lot of girls.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4986.887s">Maybe</a> that's a training our parents could partake in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=4989.429s">I</a> mean, I know it's hard to get families to come in, but just some of that training and offering that, I'm sure if parents knew about it and they felt even an inkling that they could benefit their child at home, I'm sure they would come and learn as much as they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5004.861s">I</a> really want that outreach piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5007.003s">I</a> know you're all working really, really hard with the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5010.485s">I</a> want it to extend into the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5014.186s">My</a> colleague is so right with that and I'd be happy to help in any way I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5018.669s">Just</a> let me know and I will blast it everywhere and help you in any way possible as I know my colleagues would be willing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5027.395s">Thank</a> you for your time and your motion to approve.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5659.097s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5660.098s">Is</a> this sixth question that we go through similar to the one that the police are using? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5665.301s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5666.162s">To</a> identify students that, I mean, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5669.624s">It's</a> exactly the same one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5673.887s">I</a> know there were some rules and regulations that, you know, when they're identified that they really didn't have a choice but to go for further help. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5684.04s">Are</a> we going there with our students at all?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5723.351s">No,</a> I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5724.632s">They</a> have the option of paying the citation or go into the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5728.347s">So</a> at our high school or in our schools, when we're identifying someone, are we offering them the class?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5769.334s">Okay,</a> so someone who places high, can we look at that program? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5776.353s">to</a> see if we could get that to work for our identified students within the school system?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5840.167s">And</a> that's why I thought that the linkage, that's my understanding of it, the linking, linkage, I just want that link, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5847.616s">to</a> parents and to school administrators to know that it's there, to like utilize that tool that's already in place.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5878.502s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5878.862s">That's</a> all I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=5879.563s">I</a> just want that collaboration so that way they'll be utilizing it through the schools as well as the community-based programs.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6964.631s">Just</a> a comment.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6966.933s">At</a> almost every meeting that we talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6970.593s">We</a> have groups of teachers that look at the frameworks and break them down into ways that they're interesting and learning experiences for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6978.575s">And</a> I know that Dr. Riccardelli and yourself and Dr. Chiesa do that constantly throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6987.418s">And</a> I don't think people get that understanding piece, that we take those ideas and we break them down and we bring them into the classroom so children can learn from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=6998.457s">And</a> those are the expectations for each grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7001.258s">And</a> it's really simple that that's the expectation for every third grade student throughout the Commonwealth, and that they all should reach that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7009.48s">And</a> it's not as big or difficult as all the words sound like it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7014.662s">It's</a> just making sure that all the students at a certain age or grade meet certain requirements before they move on to the next grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7023.664s">And</a> I think we do a great job of that in MedFit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7026.465s">And</a> I know it's because a lot of the work that you're doing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7710.403s">I</a> just have a comment, two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7713.725s">One,</a> with school points overview, could you just remember that the importance that the committee feels that using this technology to use it as an outreach to parents about grades and about any type of homework and assignments is really going to be expected of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7733.374s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7734.014s">We</a> just, I just really think that that's an important piece to keep in mind from day one in moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7740.278s">And</a> my second is not directly to you, it's to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7744.42s">So</a> this is great that we have professional development day for our teaching staff, but do we have anything for our administrative staff, like overviews on upgraded technologies that they might be using, like, like the admin assistance, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7758.968s">the</a> secretaries at our schools, those type of people, they deserve the thought process that we give to our other staff and that there are ways and classes and things that they can use this time as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7774.812s">And</a> if we're not thinking about it for this day, I think we should think about that for future and make them feel valued and important and that their job moves and changes as well as the teaching staff's job <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7786.888s">does</a> and the expectations of the system as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7849.184s">Yeah,</a> well I'm hoping moving forward when we have professional development that it's school wide and not just for our faculty and in that manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7857.93s">So</a> it's just something to think about, even a plan for, possibly for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7862.494s">I'm</a> sure there are Windows updates or different programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7867.778s">When</a> we transfer over to the new program, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7872.849s">The</a> school brains, the training, maybe that needs to be introduced to all the administrative staff and all the people that that is going to be changed over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7881.673s">So</a> if someone calls about their child's attendance, they're going to have to know how to use that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7886.955s">Maybe</a> we need to initiate that type of training now before we just switch it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7891.957s">I</a> mean, just want to think about the whole picture and not just the teachers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=7896.799s">Because</a> we're a whole wide system and everybody that works here is of value.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8481.655s">Questions?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8483.515s">Hi,</a> thank you, Pat. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8484.736s">This</a> is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8486.036s">I</a> had a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8487.257s">On</a> the summer school program, you said that the fees that we are accepted with $39,980, which offsets the cost of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8499.501s">Do</a> you know if we run that program in the red or in the black?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8521.22s">That</a> brings me to my other question, and it's not to you, it's to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8527.361s">We</a> asked a few weeks ago if we could see the community school's budget, and that would be included of what we used last year and what we projected, like the other budget that we had seen, and also where we are so far this year, an update on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8544.085s">We</a> also requested the budget for the fields in school rentals, like what income is coming in, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8551.379s">what</a> upgrades we've made to those facilities, what we're charging at each school, and at each location, and at each field. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8561.404s">All</a> of that information was requested, and I'm asking for that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8565.946s">So</a> going back to you, Pat, is you said that the technology, the cameras, 10% required, and we're in the bidding process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8575.671s">Do</a> you have an idea of when that will be completed?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8603.888s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8604.809s">That's</a> my only question.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8705.561s">I</a> just have one more question, not directed towards you, but towards the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8710.243s">I</a> think we were going to go over the old instruments at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8713.324s">Didn't</a> we have a comment on the old instruments?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8740.567s">I</a> understand that, but there, there is a piece of history there that needs to be utilized and they could be played. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8747.933s">by</a> people that could appreciate them.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8757.682s">No,</a> I don't mean for our students, like in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8760.464s">They</a> should be out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8761.825s">They</a> shouldn't be in a room collecting dust.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8774.812s">But</a> there might be people that generally want that and to put that work into it and to have that in their collection, rather than in our room, collecting dust that we're not utilizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8786.504s">I</a> hate to see them sitting there and not being cared for well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8791.269s">I</a> really believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8794.028s">That</a> is not the right place for them to be, and that they should be appreciated by people who would really value their thing.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8806.738s">That</a> would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8807.458s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8823.808s">I</a> just wanted to make sure it was clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8825.769s">All</a> right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8826.71s">Just</a> one more thing, Mr. Superintendent, about the instruments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8829.451s">I'd</a> like to have an inventory and a list of all the, like I think you had that, but could you present that to us again? <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8836.014s">A</a> list of all the instruments that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8839.996s">I</a> think you put it together in the past, if you could find that, or re-inventory, make sure everything's still there and nothing's missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8849.051s">We</a> know what we have, so that way we can- The instruments that are, you mean the- Antique.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8856.213s">The</a> antique instruments at this point.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8861.394s">Thank</a> you so much, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Ma9HhZR7otw&t=8863.275s">Those</a> three reports.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_6xIhPJ6iVjI/2025-03-21_6xIhPJ6iVjI.html">Medford School Committee - June 15, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=248.933s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=251.455s">Thank</a> you very much for coordinating this and bringing this to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=254.958s">I</a> mean, I'm sure that this has inspired many of them to follow in his footsteps in <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=261.248s">and</a> moving forward with their career. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=264.39s">What</a> was your most memorable piece of the day?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=424.607s">Mr.</a> Mayor.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=427.609s">Could</a> we please send a thank you note for him to come and speak with our children from the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=432.592s">I</a> think that would be very nice, and maybe that will encourage him to come back again.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1371.489s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1372.209s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1372.529s">Mr.</a> Mayor?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1375.27s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1375.91s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1376.53s">I</a> work at a school that just transferred over there, the whole system. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1380.891s">And</a> I work with Sims, and I know <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1382.89s">parent</a> piece is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1384.812s">So</a> I suggest trainings for parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1387.814s">And</a> your data is only as good as how accurate it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1391.778s">So</a> what I suggest maybe is maybe registration, like having parents re-register so that way they register right on and that the current address and current phone number and everything is actually updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1405.109s">So</a> I don't know if you could do like a computer lab <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1407.708s">at</a> each school on open house night or something and have parents going in and using that, just a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1414.193s">Because</a> if you're transferring old data to new software, it's still no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1422.399s">So</a> any way you can get hands-on information from a parent, I find that that's good, as well as the training for the parents to use the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1431.92s">I</a> strongly suggest that it should be more than a suggestion to our district teachers and staff to use this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1438.385s">It</a> should be a requirement for everybody throughout the district to transfer all of their information onto this because it's only good if we utilize the program in its full capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1449.374s">I</a> also wanted to ask you a question about the ability to link and integrate with outside programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1455.759s">Is</a> Naviance going to be up and running day one? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1458.141s">Is</a> the special education program <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1461.176s">Are</a> they going to sync every night or how often are they syncing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1465.378s">How</a> often is that data updated? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1467.298s">I</a> have a lot because I work in it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1479.963s">Are</a> they going to be up and running when the program hits the ground? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1482.224s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1510.735s">And</a> I can't really stress enough, updated data is really the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1516.356s">Once</a> parents have, I know you might not want to open the parent portal immediately to change dresses and phone numbers and stuff like that, and as you build, but that's really going to be a way for parents to keep that information up to date for our nurses and for our teachers for emergency contacts, because then you can print them a class list <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1536.982s">In</a> that way, they always have them when they're on the schoolyard or wherever they're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1540.445s">It's</a> just a great program, but we just want to make sure that the data is accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1545.95s">It's</a> only as good as the data is.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1549.373s">The</a> program's only as good as the data is. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1551.995s">So</a> I'm really happy and excited to see this for our district, but I believe, and my colleague has stressed this point repeatedly, because as parents, they have told me about <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1563.115s">How</a> difficult it is, they have to go to three different sites to find out what homework assignments are for one child. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1568.537s">And</a> if you have multiple children, that gets frustrating in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1573.239s">So</a> I really wanna suggest to the superintendent that this should be more than encouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=1577.941s">It</a> should be a requirement for our staff and our employees.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2764.985s">in</a> our funding for our food and lunch program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2768.827s">Because</a> there are going to be less students eligible for free and reduced lunch because the DESC is changing those regulations as of next year.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2785.234s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2785.494s">They're</a> changing it from free and reduced lunch to a new category.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2814.001s">I</a> know that in other districts, they're a little concerned because of the criteria for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2818.565s">It's</a> going to change the amount that we're funded for free and reduced lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2822.769s">not</a> through our community, but through all communities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2826.372s">And</a> they won't be called free and reduced lunch anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2828.894s">They're</a> going to call it, I'm sorry, I took notes earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2833.418s">It's</a> going to be all about just calling it different things and redefining the low income. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2841.925s">And</a> they're going to be a lot of changes in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2845.107s">And</a> they're going to call it economically disadvantaged now. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2848.857s">And</a> I know some schools are going to see a 50% decrease in the amount of students that are going to qualify for what was known as free and reduced lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2859.548s">And</a> that's going to affect our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2861.069s">So</a> if we go up on the price, it's going to make it harder for those families to afford to buy lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2866.215s">And</a> my concern is students not eating. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2869.226s">That's</a> my concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2871.287s">And</a> when I was looking through some of your paperwork, we're not in the red in this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2876.209s">We</a> still have, like, we have, like, what, $130,000 this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2880.59s">Am</a> I correct the way I looked at that? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2884.992s">I</a> know we started at a little deficit, but now the balance.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2899.951s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2901.412s">No,</a> I just want to make sure that I have the whole picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2903.754s">And</a> I don't want to read your budget things incorrectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2907.257s">But</a> I also am really afraid to. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2911.822s">to</a> raise the prices and have high school students say, oh, I only have $1.50 in my pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2918.487s">I</a> don't have money for lunch today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2920.789s">And</a> I know the portions have changed over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2923.211s">I</a> just don't want to see our kids hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2926.133s">A</a> concern, a very big concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2928.475s">And</a> with the government changing things in the next year or two, we're going to have less and less kids on free and reduced lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2935.501s">I</a> know that for a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2938.647s">that</a> they are looking into this and that big changes are on the horizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2942.368s">And</a> I'm just, I'm, I just don't want to, kids, too many kids are hungry in the world today. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2948.669s">I</a> don't want the monocity. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2950.389s">I</a> don't want kids going all day with nothing to eat and then have to take an AP exam or a test that really matters or a youngster going home hungry that, that parents might not have food at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2962.672s">Some</a> kids come to school and those are the only meals they get all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2965.673s">And</a> if they can't afford them here, what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2968.515s">Like</a> in the snow, I'm like, open the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2971.596s">Some</a> kids don't have heat or food at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2974.636s">We</a> have to open the schools as much as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2977.597s">I</a> feel strongly about this issue, and I'm very hesitant to raise the prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2981.757s">I</a> understand that we need good quality ingredients to feed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2985.098s">I</a> know we need good quality people to serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2988.099s">I</a> understand that costs money, so I just feel torn about this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2992.619s">And</a> with the current changes coming and unknown, <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2996.21s">I</a> have one more question that you might be able to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=2999.551s">The</a> 45% of our students, is that with 100% return rate on those documents? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3005.613s">Are</a> we really getting those all back to make sure every student that is qualified, we get that back for? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3011.215s">Are</a> we really pushing that so that way every kid that would qualify for a free lunch is getting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3017.357s">Because</a> that's a really important piece.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3029.428s">I</a> know it's a lot out there, but.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3792.787s">So</a> what's the minimum amount that we have to go up to meet the requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3800.092s">Which</a> option? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3800.772s">Is</a> that option three? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3804.213s">Because</a> I would rather meet every year and meet that minimum than overcharge every year, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3810.897s">I</a> don't want to overcharge our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3815.0s">And</a> I think some of the maintenance issues are important to maintain the proper, so that the food is cooked properly and we're not making anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3826.427s">But</a> at the same time, I really know families that don't qualify that kids won't eat because they won't have enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3833.322s">They</a> don't have the $20 every week, plus the bus fare up to the high school if the kid's tired to walk from one area of the city or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3841.605s">I</a> mean, it gets expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3843.705s">And</a> it's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3845.306s">I</a> want our children to be eating lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3847.526s">I</a> really do.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=3994.712s">Mr.</a> Mayor?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4019.021s">Mr.</a> Mayor, if I'm not mistaken, I believe Pat might have said that with this increase, there would be some money, like even the minimum increase to upgrade and to maintain our steamers and things and make a priority and utilize our food and our staff effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4037.727s">There</a> would still be some room for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4039.627s">Was</a> I mistaken? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4040.487s">Did</a> I hear that mistakenly? <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4042.488s">Or</a> is that only option three, the highest option?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4317.492s">So</a> we can fund it either through the people paying for lunches or we can fund it through our budget as far as our maintenance and make that an important thing if we need upgrades.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4365.127s">Again,</a> I can't stress how much I appreciate the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4369.31s">And</a> I know how hard you work and how hard you've kept it together for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4374.827s">without</a> having to come before us and ask for money. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4377.569s">And</a> I know you wouldn't be sitting here and asking us to increase the amount that our parents in our community has to pay for their kid to go off and have lunch every day unless you needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4389.477s">And</a> I wholeheartedly get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4391.498s">I</a> just want to make sure I protect those families and those students and make sure they eat as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4396.401s">And</a> I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4397.222s">I</a> can see it in your faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4398.563s">I</a> know it through the dedication, through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4401.108s">And</a> I'm going to work with you to make sure that we have a compromise that families can afford and that we can get what we need to provide good food for our children with the right equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4413.05s">So</a> I just want to be careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4415.27s">I</a> just want to be careful that our kids don't go hungry. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4417.991s">And</a> if in any way that seems unappreciative to you, I don't want to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4424.632s">Because</a> I know the dedication and the hard work and why you haven't come before us in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4429.863s">is</a> because you also don't want to go up on the prices for these children.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIhPJ6iVjI&t=4570.296s">Yes.</a>

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=490.984s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=491.424s">Thank</a> you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=493.144s">So</a> I know that I hold you accountable when things don't go well, and I also want to hold you accountable for when things are going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=502.086s">This</a> is a very big achievement for our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=505.467s">I</a> read through what the recommendations are, and there are a few building things which will get budgeted for and fixed now because they were in black and white from the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=517.219s">There's</a> a couple collaboration things that we still need to work on throughout the thing, but we're doing wonderful work. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=524.242s">You're</a> doing wonderful work. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=525.782s">This</a> is years of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=527.983s">This</a> is a moment in time of how the school is on the day that they came, but it's a year in prepping and a year after. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=537.747s">So</a> you're at the midpoint now. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=539.528s">Take</a> a breath, enjoy your victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=542.149s">You</a> did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=543.705s">I'm</a> proud of all of you, and I'm proud to be part of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=547.117s">Thank</a> you for all the work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1217.632s">So</a> it was a surprise to you that he had done that? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1220.553s">It</a> was a surprise.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1222.754s">And</a> today, with how tight our budget has been, and the program has really run well, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1233.15s">And</a> we all appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1234.852s">But</a> these type of situations, when teachers and administrators go out and go above and beyond to bring money back into the community and to our students, I just want to say thank you to you and to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1246.966s">Maloney</a> for taking these opportunities and to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1252.654s">and</a> on our students' behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1254.615s">So</a> I hope you tell Mr. Maloney, and I'm telling you directly, that I love to see this in the teachers and the care and the effort that you put forth for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1266.821s">It's</a> appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1267.562s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1681.332s">Just</a> to clarify, this is just the evening classes for children that have graduated from Most Method Vocational High School and other graduated high school people that want to continue their <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1695.738s">their</a> licensure or complete a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=1699.459s">Am</a> I correct?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2021.214s">A</a> lot of my questions were about staffing, who's going to staff the evening program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2026.107s">And</a> my other question is, how do you figure out the cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2030.169s">And</a> I just want to make sure that the maintenance of our equipment for our students is upgraded a little bit because of those costs and because of the usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2041.173s">I</a> just want to see some of that money go back if there is any profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2044.995s">I</a> know there might not be profit in the beginning, but when there is profit, that we reinvest those dollars into the vocational school to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2053.398s">things</a> up to date and if they're being used more, we need to make sure that they're maintained more. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2060.265s">That's</a> a concern I have.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2119.968s">So</a> through you to the superintendent, when we figure out this funding piece in the income from these programs, can we please set aside a good maintenance, a good amount of this money to go back into our vocational school, not only the maintenance of the programs that it is existing, but the advancement of other programs through this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2164.633s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2869.097s">I'm</a> glad to see you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2871.338s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2872.478s">And</a> I also want to take this moment to commend our administration and our superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2877.74s">Because</a> not only have I seen him support you and the need that you had, I've seen him do it repeatedly throughout a district to many of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2888.443s">And</a> a lot of people don't realize how much of a big heart that administrative team have for all employees within our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2897.487s">And</a> I see it not only in the superintendent, but his whole administrative team, repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2906.013s">And</a> the community needs to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2909.296s">Secondly,</a> I wanted to talk more about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2912.218s">I</a> was speaking to my sister about this before I came tonight, as I was reviewing the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2917.461s">And</a> the bond that MedFit teachers have with their students, and the students, and the commitment that the students have to our teachers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2927.391s">Now</a> your teacher was gone for a year and a half, so you must have had a strong bond with him for you to not give up when things got tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2936.512s">and</a> keep trying until you got it right.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2967.313s">So</a> this is a dream of every teacher? <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2971.118s">To</a> motivate children to <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2974.225s">to</a> figure out problems, to be self-driven, to figure things out, to work really hard, and to inspire them in a love for learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2983.729s">And</a> you have that, and you represented that, and you gave it back to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2988.27s">So</a> that, to me, is commendable throughout this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=2992.432s">And</a> I just want to comment, and I'd like mom and dad to stand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3004.703s">is</a> talking about the struggles and how he came home and spoke to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3008.784s">Dad's</a> over there shaking his head, like how he didn't give up and how you guys encouraged him. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3014.686s">So</a> it takes a community to raise our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3019.308s">And</a> I'm seeing that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3020.969s">We</a> have parents, we have teachers, and we have students that really care. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3025.21s">And</a> I'm really feeling very happy to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3028.071s">And</a> I'm looking forward to see what you do in your future. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3030.992s">Yeah,</a> me too.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3793.42s">I</a> too was going to ask for a budget for the last few years to go over what we've done, how much money's come in, because I know we've put a new program in how parents pay in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3804.665s">And</a> I wanted to know, I know now that you can track things a little. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3809.387s">easier</a> electronically, and we can see where the money's gone in and where the money's gone out, and if there are any surplus funds, and what equipment needs to be updated as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3818.689s">If</a> we knew that, you know, as well, and what other big expenditures for this program we need to pay for in the near future, that would also be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3829.191s">So</a> any information and all information would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3832.932s">Thank</a> you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3833.932s">And</a> I'm not saying, the price of food has gone up, and I understand that we may need to do this at some point, but we just want to make sure we do our due diligence as a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=3844.163s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5803.919s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5804.4s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=5804.84s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6903.462s">I</a> thank you for your report, it was very thorough, and I appreciate how you worked everything out. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6908.884s">I</a> just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6911.545s">You</a> asked for another health education teacher to assist teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6919.255s">to</a> help them implement the curriculum due to the social emotional issues of children in the classroom and I want to address that but I want to address that as a whole district and we talked about possibly having a meeting because we have many departments requesting staff to help this both <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6942.263s">A</a> few people have come through, the guidance department has come through to help us with this, to make requests for additional staff members to help with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6951.468s">Other</a> department heads have come through. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6954.61s">And</a> we did talk about a few weeks ago or a few meetings ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=6958.472s">having</a> a meeting to discuss this and how we were going to address this, rather than each department coming and asking the committee for additional supports, but in this manner, as to which is the best way to support our educators in this realm and where those positions should be placed, whether they should be more nurses or more guidance people or more, you know, rather than each department.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7060.399s">Well,</a> that that's my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7062.0s">We</a> keep discussing this as it keeps coming forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7064.741s">And</a> I think it's great that each department is bringing that, but we did discuss meeting to see which is the best way to move forward to supporting our students needs as well as our staffing needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7075.845s">So</a> we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7077.166s">I</a> don't know if you've set up a time for that, Mr. Nelson.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=7136.713s">My</a> concern is that we don't just put bodies in certain departments, that we as a committee determine where that need can be best.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8269.009s">I</a> just want to comment on one of our teachers becoming the Matisol Teacher of the Year award. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8274.812s">I</a> know Teresa very well and she's been a long standing, dedicated teacher throughout our community for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8282.776s">And</a> I personally want to congratulate her as well as a member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8287.037s">This</a> is the type of thing that we hope all of our teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8291.045s">become</a> and I look at her as a master teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8295.408s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8296.029s">She's</a> incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8297.19s">And</a> this is a huge, this is throughout all of the United States.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8418.359s">So</a> I see what your wish list is for 2016, and I see a large increase in software. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8427.744s">What</a> type of software would that be?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8451.571s">Okay,</a> and my other question is about your assessment tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8454.534s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=8455.054s">Are</a> those to keep up with regulations that have come forth?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9013.869s">So</a> I noticed that you're moving the summer fund program from the Columbus School to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9019.795s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9020.856s">Is</a> that going to affect the program in any way?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9063.858s">Well,</a> I know that the students have walked in the past from the Columbus to Tufts pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9069.063s">So</a> for safety reasons, that's always great. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9072.185s">As</a> long as the children still get enough outside time, because I know the tough school, it was weather related because it was an outside pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9080.311s">So</a> they might get more exercise and more swim time, but as long as they get outside and use the fields and stuff like that, that's really important as well.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9253.73s">I</a> just wanted, well, first thing I was going to talk about is the maintenance at the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9257.833s">So</a> I'm glad that school is getting a little bit of a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9260.115s">I</a> know there are other programs being run out of that, out of that school, the special education programs are still going to be, I'm assuming in that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9271.743s">So,</a> but it does deserve a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9274.105s">It's,</a> it's been used, you know, quite often in, <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9278.068s">quite</a> a bit, and this does give it the chance it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9282.612s">And</a> also, I just wanted to comment on the Summer Fund program in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9288.316s">I</a> think it's an excellent program. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9290.357s">It's</a> priced extremely affordable, and I think it has a really important need within our community that really helps our parents that have to go to work to have a safe place for their children. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9305.34s">and</a> that they're really, they're learning swimming, they're outside, they're well cared for, and it's $145 a week, which is well below what other camps cost our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/suH7AXXbrvY&t=9318.33s">So</a> I'm really grateful to have this for our families in our community.

 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=356.268s">Oh,</a> this is a new one. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=357.428s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=358.169s">Oh,</a> cause I, I always hear of this donation every year for, for the Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=362.731s">So</a> now they have a new, they have a new donor. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=365.372s">That's,</a> that's wonderful news. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=367.716s">And</a> it's good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=368.436s">That's</a> really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=369.376s">I'm</a> so glad that our community is really looking at our schools as a place to really help children learn in creative ways that, you know, the doll is a stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=383.26s">So</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=384.32s">It's</a> wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=385.3s">It's</a> nice giving back. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=386.581s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=648.799s">Madam</a> Mayor, I also want to express our thanks to our teachers because without an advisor for this group, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=656.869s">It</a> wouldn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=657.93s">And</a> I know that this particular group takes a lot of hours and time to be ready for this competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=664.315s">And</a> in MedFed, I want to really tell the community how wonderful our teachers are and you exemplified our best. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=674.163s">Thank</a> you very much for your time.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1024.604s">Mr.</a> Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1025.024s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1025.404s">I</a> have a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1026.465s">First</a> of all, in regards to the kindergarten needs, could you please provide us a report of what the difference in cost would be to up all the part-time people to full-time? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1037.502s">That's</a> my first request. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1040.344s">Secondly,</a> I want to know if the larger kindergarten classes at the McGlynn, with 23 students in two classes, are receiving, both of those have full-time kindergarten aides.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1077.256s">So</a> in those two classes at the McGlynn School that have 23 students in each class, there is a full-time kindergarten aide because that's a lot of kindergartners for someone not to have an aide with them in the afternoon.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1094.009s">Overall,</a> our class sizes are one of the best I've ever seen in the state of Massachusetts, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1101.015s">But</a> 23 is still a large number of little ones, and I personally believe that we need to look into having full-time aides in our classrooms, because kindergarten is the foundation of our education, and if you're tying shoes instead of actually teaching, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1117.857s">That's</a> detrimental to the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1120.638s">So</a> that's my opinion, and I would like to know whether those two largest classrooms have full-time kindergarten aides.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1131.384s">I</a> want to make sure those two rooms are the ones that have the full-time aides.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1136.866s">Madam</a> Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1137.727s">It</a> says part-time at. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1139.007s">Oh,</a> no, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1139.668s">I'll</a> check it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1141.909s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1142.549s">So</a> we need to look at this.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1333.923s">I</a> have a few more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1335.967s">First</a> of all, I really appreciate the breakdown in the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1339.989s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1340.75s">But</a> I'm wondering, at the Andrews and the McGlen Middle Schools, how many children are in each class, like in English? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1347.714s">I</a> know you give me the total numbers of each class grade, but breaking down how many kids are in the chairs for science, for math, for, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1357.459s">I</a> don't know that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1358.7s">I</a> don't think we've ever broken it down that way.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1415.084s">OK,</a> no, I just needed clarification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1417.185s">I</a> think that's sufficient at this point, as long as those numbers are <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1421.138s">And</a> each team has four teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1424.062s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1424.743s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1425.124s">And</a> that hasn't changed? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1427.207s">And</a> they rotate. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1428.168s">And</a> for all three grade levels in both buildings, each team, there's not one team with less teachers or anything?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1436.361s">OK,</a> great to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1437.655s">So</a> that explains that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1439.357s">I</a> also want to comment on the vocational school, the number of freshmen this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1443.923s">That's</a> a great number to see that increase in students at Medford Vocational School. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1449.609s">And</a> it's overall increase from last year's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1453.114s">So</a> that means that we're keeping children in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1457.182s">And</a> some of our high school kids are actually going to the vocational school, because our programming is really developing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1464.148s">And</a> we're making great offerings and great strides with our students in our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1468.331s">And</a> I know you've done a great deal of work for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1471.473s">And</a> that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1474.316s">I</a> know I said great too many times.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1477.338s">I'm</a> so happy about it.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1479.972s">Really?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1482.193s">It</a> happens once in a while.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1519.125s">It's</a> been great work.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1527.13s">That</a> was a lot of work by administration, by teachers, by the building changes, and by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1533.315s">And</a> it's been a lot of years to work for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1535.096s">And</a> we're seeing the fruits of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1538.517s">Well,</a> maybe not last, but two more, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1542.838s">On</a> page one, number three, there are 23% of our students whose first language is not English. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1548.439s">And</a> our ELL student population is 7.8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1550.979s">What's</a> the average statewide?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1561.261s">Okay,</a> so we're right on.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1564.042s">And</a> in the next category as well, students with disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1567.125s">We're</a> at 18% of our population.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1571.25s">So</a> we're pretty close. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1572.891s">We're</a> pretty much in the ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1574.633s">So</a> with that in mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1577.296s">So</a> there's some changes at the vocational school and at our middle schools with different kids going to different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1584.938s">I</a> want to make sure that our other services are looked at, not just teaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1590.92s">Our</a> student services, our nursing, our ELL classes are meeting requirements in better than requirements, because we want better than. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1600.628s">you</a> know, the best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1602.288s">But</a> I just think that we need to look at that too and don't just assume, like if there's a larger population going to one school than another, we might need more nursing staff at that school or more, you know, special education things. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1616.352s">And</a> I also know that we service different students at different buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1621.574s">Like</a> I know for middle school, a lot of the ELL students are at the McGlenn. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1626.554s">So</a> those children are pulled out for a period of time for the day, but they're backing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1634.297s">In</a> our elementary schools, it's a bigger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1636.258s">We</a> have one school that a lot of students are pulled out, but when they go back into the general ed classroom, how does that change the numbers of that classroom when you count those students in a C for the other parts of the day? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1651.624s">Because</a> that really increases class size.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1674.262s">That</a> brings more issues to me than what is our physical education class numbers.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1680.368s">I'd</a> like to know what pretty good. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1681.369s">We</a> can provide them to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1682.33s">I</a> would like to see that.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1737.02s">So</a> I would like to know class sizes for our other classrooms, our physical education classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1744.163s">Just</a> because we don't get that data, and I want to make sure that we have enough people in place for our computer classes and our art classes, so those aren't overcrowded and that we have enough staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1754.067s">And</a> we're looking at everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1756.708s">District</a> wide rather than just the everyday classrooms, because those classes are really important to the overall full child, which is what we look at here.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1779.779s">I</a> think that's all my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1782.14s">Thank</a> you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=1784.821s">No,</a> just on this page.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2666.655s">Speaking</a> of that, I know the letter, I read the letter, it looks great, I think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2673.401s">I</a> know that parents get so much information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2676.344s">I</a> know this has to be on here and all the information you included. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2680.648s">But</a> in general, I feel like parents like bullets and quick information and what dates are and those in bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2688.755s">less</a> is more, and as a former parent who used to get a lot of paperwork, so not in this particular case, but in general, I think that schools need to be aware of that when there's any more notices. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2701.358s">So,</a> or even on the back page, if it was bulleted, MCAS test no longer in place, park test, and the dates that they're planned at each school, as like a preview for parents, is an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2715.322s">My</a> second, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2718.383s">Our</a> recommendation is possibly auto-call, because some parents just don't read a lot of the backpacked information, and they might hear it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2728.291s">Any</a> additional ways that we can reach out to parents, we have to differentiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2733.696s">We</a> have to use all different ways of reaching our parents, just like we do in our classroom with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2740.281s">So</a> an email if we're doing email blasts, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2745.455s">Or</a> I know that some schools are on Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2749.177s">All</a> those methods should be, this is an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2752.619s">We're</a> changing the standardized testing throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2756.621s">All</a> parents should be made aware that this decision has been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2759.763s">And</a> that communication has to be sent out in multiple ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=2763.265s">So</a> that's my suggestion.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3264.032s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3265.113s">I</a> always have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3266.794s">First</a> of all, thank you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3268.255s">It's</a> very thorough and it's very good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3270.377s">I'd</a> like an update after the spring is how many of our teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3274.697s">still</a> need SEI? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3276.218s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3277.138s">I</a> mean, retail certification in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3281.421s">Also,</a> I'd like to know, not directly to you, I want two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3285.663s">First</a> of all, are we in compliance with the state guidelines for the teacher ELL student ratio?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3313.312s">And</a> are we there throughout, even the middle and high school?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3337.533s">So</a> over means how many students over, do you estimate?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3366.067s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3366.768s">Through</a> you, Mayor Burke, to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3371.571s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3373.692s">What</a> things are we planning moving forward for the large influx of newcomers? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3380.016s">And</a> are we planning for our new budget to look at these and really look at staffing needs <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3390.165s">And</a> is this so high right now that we need to make a change right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3394.607s">I</a> mean, that seems almost, it's not quite double, but it's pretty close to double the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3402.391s">I</a> know there's no, I know ELL and DSEE is very vague. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3408.213s">There's</a> a lot of play and there's not good regs that we have exactly adhere to yet, but they're coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3416.87s">Whether</a> or not it's there, we're well over the recommended amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3420.113s">That's</a> not what we want for our children's education as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3424.717s">So</a> could you look at that and please come back to us with some type of plan?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3588.498s">In</a> my experience from being here and hearing it every year, the need is only growing throughout the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3597.806s">So</a> I just want to make sure that going forward, we have in place what is in the best interest of the students so that way they get the help as a newcomer and get back into the general education classrooms with the teachers that are trained in retail. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3613.038s">So</a> that's also my goal, but we need to have really good <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3618.628s">beginner</a> classes to get those children back into the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3623.251s">And</a> we need staff to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3624.712s">So</a> I just want to keep in mind moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=3627.935s">And</a> if there is a bigger influx coming in, I would like to be made aware of it if those numbers change or increase.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4930.164s">Any</a> questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4930.664s">Mayor</a> Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4932.567s">Mr.</a> Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4933.228s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4933.588s">I</a> just want to say that this is done very well, Kathy.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4939.851s">Very</a> well. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4940.892s">It</a> really has, it really does completely explain our policy and procedures throughout the district and the fact that we have almost 25% of our teachers, Jacinda,
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4956.242s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4957.442s">That's</a> a lot of people.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4979.215s">So</a> as a trainer of de-escalation and restraint training by, <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4985.543s">I</a> really looked through this to make sure it was done well, and it's excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4989.445s">And</a> again, all your reports usually are very thorough and very excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4994.527s">I</a> motion to approve this, and this is great work. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4997.448s">Thank</a> you for all your work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=4999.289s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5001.17s">Hi.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5319.184s">Wonderful.</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5322.825s">Just</a> a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5324.366s">When</a> there's an acting person in the school or in the classroom, usually they call the safety care team. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5332.829s">And</a> then people who have the in-depth training come to that student. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5338.811s">And</a> they take over that situation because they're the ones trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5343.357s">So</a> the teacher that's teaching that class doesn't necessarily have to have that in-depth training. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5349.32s">They</a> just have to have the de-escalation techniques and be able to identify that it's escalating to a point that they need to call for the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5359.265s">So</a> I don't know if that helps.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5613.067s">I</a> just have one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5614.688s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5615.729s">Are</a> our high school nurses and middle school nurses, is there someone in the building most times that have this training?
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5624.895s">Everybody?</a> 
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=5656.528s">Great,</a> thank you very much.
 <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]: <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=6009.7s">Before</a> we move forward, during this moment, I'd also like to show some support to a very dear friend of mine who's living with cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=6017.782s">And</a> her friends and family are all taking pictures at different areas throughout the community to show our love and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=6026.144s">So</a> to Mary Pierce, I wish you luck in your battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/C0nvMKTnl38&t=6029.785s">And</a> I just want to say, Pierce strong.
