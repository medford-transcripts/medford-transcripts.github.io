href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11712.148s">First,</a> I want to say that a comment that was made by, I can't think of her name right now, about the CPA funds that Cameron, Roberta Cameron, just to <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11725.245s">let</a> people know that those CPA funds are property owners' tax money that they're charged a surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11733.488s">This</a> came about about five or six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11736.489s">We</a> were supposed to get rebates, matching funds from the state, but the state has stiffed the city of Medford and others for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11744.492s">So</a> that's our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11746.653s">It</a> appeared that this money was coming out of the sky, you know, just dropping down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11750.074s">No,</a> it's our money, our property owners' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11752.995s">So</a> now, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11756.004s">I</a> have, it's not gonna take long to say this, but I've been listening and watching, and I've been in Medford for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11762.41s">I've</a> been around the world, I've been in different

gonna present my little treatise here, and I hope you got your seatbelts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11781.547s">to</a> say that I am disappointed and angry, but not surprised in the least by the actions, attitudes, and discriminatory accusations towards our citizens that the current irresponsible and questionable motions being brought by the sitting council this evening is monumentally understated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11802.465s">The</a> sitting council members <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11804.423s">supported,</a> endorsed, and financed by the progressive socialist group Our Revolution, has furtively laid the groundwork to target and punish Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11814.566s">In</a> particular, homeowners, business owners, taxpayers, and workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11819.248s">That's</a> just about everyone except themselves and their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11822.589s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11823.83s">You</a> have drawn that infamous red line in the sand, creating a schism <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11828.55s">which</a> is, for all intents and purposes, the systematic and ultimate degradation of a city, along with its people, that stands proud, friendly, productive, prosperous, caring, diverse, in our favorite word, inclusive, for more years than most of you have walked the earth, but many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11846.775s">You</a> exercise ambiguous language when you attempt to introduce us to national political agendas under the guise of, it's good for Medford, when in fact it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11857.339s">Your</a> efforts in these matters are not welcome, as are not your attempts to indoctrinate the Medford to a socialist system, not here, not now, not ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11867.243s">I</a> am steadfast in declaring that I have very little faith <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11871.344s">If</a> any at all in all in your abilities to perform your duties as city Councilors, your lack of experience in life circus is pretty evident verbosity is not a substitute for performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11882.894s">We</a> are not fooled, and we are not fools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11886.878s">Understand</a> this. <a

contributed to and for the betterment of Medford, are the people who you work for, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11900.502s">We</a> are not your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11902.363s">I</a> refuse, as I hope we all do, to be treated as fodder for your political ideologies and schemes, none which are beneficial for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11911.267s">This</a> is not the place for you to build your curriculum vitae on the backs in the bank accounts <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11917.327s">of</a> Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11919.028s">What</a> gives you the audacity to assume such? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11922.05s">Your</a> responsibility as city councilors when you took the oath of office was to ensure that we have a city made safe for its residents, schools, students, visitors, good streets, sidewalks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, to welcome and support businesses so that they may flourish in also as important, if not most importantly, financial integrity, discipline, and acuity, which we are sorely lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11945.265s">Fix</a> this first. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11947.047s">Don't</a> burden us financially because we have a weak, ineffective, and irresponsible administration, and you lack the tools and experience needed to mitigate this problem. <a

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1342.433s">My</a> name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1345.294s">It's</a> like a church in here, so quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1347.295s">Not</a> that I would know, but anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1349.257s">I'm</a> glad you brought this up, Councilor Bears, because I wanted to bring up something that we did several years ago when Chief Sacker was around. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1358.942s">terrible</a> parking problems down in South Medford, down on Yale Harbor, Main Street and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1364.665s">We</a> started at the Kennedy Condominiums, a group of neighbors, must have been about 20 of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1373.549s">We</a> walked the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1374.91s">We</a> walked and saw the situation, the problems that we were experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1380.312s">We</a> wound up all the way down to Columbus Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1384.294s">The</a> problem you have is one of the things that's increased the traffic <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1388.786s">to</a> cut through traffic is when they put that juggernaut across from the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1395.108s">People</a> don't want to go down there, wait for the turn, take a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1398.409s">They're</a> going down to Alexander Avenue now, or cutting across Harvard, and then they're zooming down to Willis Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1403.651s">It's</a> really dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1404.691s">And</a> the children there, I mean, the poor traffic supervisors there, they put their lives at risk over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1410.493s">I</a> mean, I can hear them yelling at the people in the morning sometimes, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1414.594s">But</a> for every solution, <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1418.186s">the</a> way the city is right now, it creates a problem on another part of that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1423.791s">Because</a> I don't really see any solution to divert all the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1428.494s">All</a> I see is a heavy duty, a heavy hand in enforcement, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1433.398s">Because</a> that may defer or deter some of the activities that are going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1439.183s">It</a> is, you know, I'm out five o'clock in the morning walking my dog and I bring a light and I have to flash it when I cross Willis Ave because they're flying up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1448.359s">Like</a> Councilor Beall said, if they're not doing 50, they're not doing anything, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1453.423s">And</a> even sometimes with the light, I think they must know where they wanna run me over because it'll slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1459.728s">But</a> anyway, I think it would be great to get together because I don't think the traffic engineer or anybody would be able to go down there and say, okay, we're gonna do this because it has to be, you have to have all the voices, you have to have what the concerns are and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1473.854s">And</a> here's one thing that I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1476.116s">When</a> you're coming up Willis Avenue, and you're going to approach Hicks, or going to the left to go to Columbus School, or Missy's Steak, or Missy Tuck, you don't see the stop sign until you get right to the top of the rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1491.707s">And</a> that's dangerous, because people don't see the stop sign, so they're not slowing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1496.571s">They</a> got these great guys that take the corners really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1499.673s">Somebody's</a> gonna get killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1502.133s">I</a> appreciate that, and I just wish that we would put something together so the neighbors can get together and say, here's our concerns, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1510.297s">And</a> see what happens from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1512.318s">By</a> the way, the Aisle Street parking lot, I mean, it's still a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1515.859s">It's</a> getting worse, just to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1517.5s">So,</a> thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14/2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14.html">City Council 05-23-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10613.349s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10614.349s">Anthony</a> D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10616.95s">Two</a> points. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10618.833s">I</a> agree with the bounty hunter aspect of it, because today, as I was enjoying a cup of coffee, I watched one of the enforcement agents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10633.078s">Ambassador,</a> I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10634.638s">Ambassador.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10635.858s">And</a> he went to this truck, which his friend of mine was having coffee with me, and he had like 10 minutes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10643.461s">The</a> guy walked by. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10644.301s">Then</a> he came back, and he was hovering around the car, and he kept doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10648.645s">I</a> kept doing this, so with about two minutes left, we had to write down some signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10652.286s">He</a> went over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10653.046s">This</a> gentleman was waiting for this thing to expire because he figured, well, it's like seven minutes left. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10658.308s">He's</a> definitely not going to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10661.149s">But</a> that's been happening, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10663.31s">And</a> I feel bad for the people that are up in the office of Republic because they're only the messengers and they're taking a lot of the grief, the citizens who have the jobs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10672.333s">But</a> the problem I have is that we've had a reduction in enforcement because <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10677.272s">When</a> people went to get their stickers for permit parking, they got no stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10683.036s">So</a> now what happens is we have an influx of cars coming in there after the enforcement is over and on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10690.22s">And</a> when you call the police, the police say, we don't know who has a sticker and who doesn't, because they don't have the software, they don't have the wherewithal to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10699.106s">So</a> that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10700.367s">And</a> when I called up Republic, they said, well, we're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10703.749s">But</a> I asked a simple question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10705.27s">I</a> said, well, why did you change the scheme? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10707.795s">from</a> giving out the stickers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10708.855s">I</a> mean, everybody does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10710.336s">You</a> put a sticker there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10712.317s">Well,</a> she didn't have an answer because she's not in the corporate end of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10714.918s">So</a> I'm hoping that when these people come, we have the meeting, that we get this answer.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10721.3s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10721.74s">Now,</a> who's going to be responsible for the payment of those stickers and for the cost of the stickers? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10725.841s">And</a> how will they do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10726.862s">I</a> mean, if everybody has their placards and they're in the book already, that way they're going to get them to all the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10734.064s">And</a> who's going to pay for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10736.822s">If</a> you have visitor passes, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10741.465s">No,</a> no, no, I understand that, but you went for the permit, you have the permit, and you don't have the decal, but you have two placards for visitor passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10751.292s">How</a> are they going to get the decals for the people who bought?
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10762.94s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10763.64s">There's</a> a lot of other issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10766.456s">I'll</a> wait until this meeting comes up, but I just wanted to say that there's a net, the net results so far on the permit parking is negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10772.978s">We're</a> not getting the enforcement and we're getting more people from Somerville parking on the side streets where there's permit parking because there's no enforcement and you can't blame the police because they don't know, they don't have the information, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10784.06s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c/2025-03-21_Fcwn-qU-L9c.html">Medford City Council - January 20, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5564.817s">Anthony</a> D'Antonio, 12 Yale street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5568.419s">Um,</a> a couple of points I want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5571.055s">And</a> I try not to be redundant on any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5573.717s">But</a> I was on the way home this evening, passing the South Medford Square, and I noticed a decrease in the amount of vehicles out in front of the stores, from Alexander Avenue to Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5585.227s">A</a> really big decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5586.428s">And</a> usually when I drive by there, they're loaded, they're crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5589.811s">Even</a> on my street, there's people there parked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5592.695s">I</a> don't know if they would, Tuesday night is always a busy night down there with the Oasis and with Pacelli's, but I got home and I received a phone call, a reverse 911 call from Captain Clemente indicating that we will have three public and police, we're going to have the three meetings discussing the parking situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5613.212s">at</a> the Academy, if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5615.653s">I</a> think it's going to be at the Academy, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5619.895s">I</a> was in a rush to get out and I was listening to Clemente leave the message there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5625.857s">My</a> point is that a good effort on the part of the Medford police in trying to do this, but I still say wholeheartedly that the meeting should be taken here and that the mayor should be here to answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5641.203s">Nothing</a> gets done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5642.798s">The</a> point doesn't get across unless he is here taking the heat on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5646.62s">I</a> mean, when, where's the surprise when, who didn't think this was going to happen after he went mute on the parking proposals put by your committee that you had, nothing was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5659.086s">Nothing</a> was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5659.686s">Then</a> all of a sudden it comes in with a guillotine and we got this parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5664.149s">Now</a> you want to raise revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5665.589s">You</a> want to put parking meters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5666.69s">You</a> don't want, this is not a kiosk city unless you put them in the, in the parking lots and then you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5671.148s">You</a> don't need to put your license plate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5672.709s">They</a> can run a piece of paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5674.59s">And</a> they have a software that says, OK, you're a young person. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5690.861s">The</a> thing that I have a question of is, when this was being negotiated, didn't anybody from the finance department, budget director, or the purchasing department <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5700.227s">get</a> an idea that this was going up towards a million dollars on behalf of the city to put forward this program? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5706.529s">I</a> mean, if it's a million dollars, it normally is going to take a three year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5709.911s">And</a> I think it's time for the city to say, okay, thanks for the time you put into this, but this is not for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5716.513s">We</a> have to find a different solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5718.374s">There</a> are other solutions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5720.234s">And</a> unfortunately it requires a lot of personnel on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5723.876s">And</a> it also requires a mayor who can get the money from one <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5727.776s">and</a> put into a budget where we need public safety officers, we need DPW people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5732.419s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of things that can be done, but this just doesn't, and there's nothing against the Republic Parking System. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5738.283s">I</a> mean, they're all good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5739.184s">They</a> have a bottom line they have to meet, but this is always the way the city runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5744.908s">The</a> mayor doesn't like what some people do, and he comes up with his own plan, and then he, you know, he hits Mrs. Murphy's car on the rear wrench, opens the pond door, and you guys are all chasing the car down the street as well as the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5756.974s">And</a> it's the wrong way to run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5759.495s">And</a> that's because this charter has not been reviewed for 30 years in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5764.196s">There's</a> absolute power in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5766.077s">And</a> to expect anything else, like Charlie Brown always thought that Lucy was going to hold the football when he goes to kick it, but she always moves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5773.019s">That's</a> what we have with this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5775.579s">You</a> don't get what we're paying for here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5777.34s">We</a> have to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5779.04s">And</a> people have to be made aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5780.541s">We've</a> got to stop all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5783.762s">Well,</a> never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5784.842s">Anyway.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5786.177s">I</a> hope that the people understand that there are a lot of pros and cons with these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5792.282s">And</a> I've seen a lot of people having difficulty, a lot of difficulty with the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5796.825s">It's</a> a hell of a lot easier to put a quarter and a card, a credit card in those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5802.99s">And</a> one thing I think I heard one of the representatives from Republic say that the information is secure when you put your license plate number in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5813.438s">And</a> I strongly disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5817.088s">There</a> is no information that's secure once it goes into the cloud, or it goes into the airways, or it goes into the software, because there are companies out there that do this particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5826.993s">I</a> could take Mr. Nash up to a place in New Hampshire and show him his own company in a particular data aggregator, and they won't even know that they're being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5836.318s">And</a> I have a feeling that it's not their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5839.62s">It's</a> just the way the society is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5841.741s">But</a> anyway, I really hope that— Point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5849.867s">No,</a> no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5853.65s">To</a> give you an example, Groupon sells coupons for golf memberships and causes special discounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5861.677s">Well,</a> you can go up there and they can go right into their system and see who's signing the coupons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5866.715s">So</a> what happens is you manufacture golf clubs, you come to me, I sell you a list, the people that are buying the memberships to the golf course.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5881.479s">They</a> can't sell it.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5882.62s">They</a> won't.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5888.342s">I</a> said I could take you to a company in New Hampshire that does this, and they could go into the site.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5901.671s">I</a> just think a little more consideration on behalf of the mayor should have been taken for the people in the city of Medford.

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9608.12s">What</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9609.0s">We're</a> made to believe that all these years that we were able to park in the streets, that we were supposed to bow down and say, well, thank you for letting us park in your streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9617.344s">Now,</a> if you have to go with these kiosks, and I see dozens of people, elderly people, young people, still having difficulty with the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9627.408s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9627.808s">You</a> said you saw people in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9629.329s">I</a> mean, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9630.309s">But</a> I see people having great difficulty here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9632.993s">So</a> the thing is you don't put the money in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9634.755s">You</a> get a ticket, you're forced to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9636.717s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9637.258s">It</a> comes into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9638.639s">This</a> is, this is not the right way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9640.662s">I</a> mean, citizens will put up with it for a period of time, but it's, I had a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9646.428s">I</a> had two businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9648.71s">The</a> Councilors have businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9651.053s">You,</a> if you don't know how to run a business, what it takes to run a business, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9654.93s">There's</a> no compassion for the people out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9657.811s">I</a> mean, the Chamber of Commerce, you know, for this particular program should be called the Chamber of Horrors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9662.574s">I</a> mean, what have they done to this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9664.895s">I</a> mean, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9665.735s">And</a> I feel bad that Chief Sacco has to come up here also. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9668.676s">The</a> mayor should be sitting right here and taking the heat for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9672.258s">And</a> I want the citizens of Medford to know whose fathers, or who's with the mayor, and who's with the program, and what are you going to do for the citizens? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9679.662s">Because</a> it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9681.042s">I</a> mean, Harvard Street and Main Street, it was crowded all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9685.032s">There</a> was nobody up there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9686.712s">They're</a> gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9687.513s">People</a> are complaining about businesses, even the Oasis Restaurant, one of the busiest places around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9692.214s">He's</a> already dipped because they don't—these guys, they work hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9695.575s">They</a> don't want a $25 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9697.575s">I</a> mean, that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9698.335s">It's</a> coming out of their pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9699.716s">It's</a> coming out of the table, food, clothing for their children and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9703.256s">So</a> it's got to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9704.757s">It's</a> got to be every week until something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9707.517s">I</a> would think that I would like to see a hold put on to the start of this program because <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9714.59s">We're</a> not ready for it, the citizens are not ready for it, and the businesses are already starting to pay the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9719.852s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ/2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ.html">Medford City Council - January 6, 2015</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3853.308s">For</a> what purpose do they exist and for whom do they serve? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3856.596s">They</a> stood by mutely and watched as certain businesses remained free and clear of kiosks, while other businesses did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3863.981s">Some</a> politicians lack business experience and business sense, not all but some. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3869.125s">But</a> the smart ones, the ones who truly recognize it is their responsibility to work on behalf of the citizenry, will reach out and put the business paradigm on the table in an open forum, not behind closed doors at the expense of the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3884.876s">Why,</a> for instance? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3886.083s">And</a> please take note that I am objectively pointing out examples, free of any animosity, and as neutral as I can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3894.029s">But</a> I need to make this point by example. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3896.771s">Why</a> do we place kiosks in the center of West Medford Square, but have none as you enter from Arlington? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3903.135s">Examples</a> given, Joe's Peach and Charles Liquors, in the block of stores as you approach Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3909.099s">By</a> the way, I received a text earlier today from Joan Gatto, who is the owner and proprietor of <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3915.125s">magnificent</a> muffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3916.366s">She</a> is out of town and wanted me to express her concern on this particular program, as well as the concern she has for her other business colleagues in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3926.474s">Now</a> to continue, I have to make a statement here and it is with all due respect and it concerns the placement and not placement of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3943.846s">and</a> several business establishments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3947.207s">I</a> have been a long friend to the Dello Russo family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3954.108s">I</a> have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3956.709s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3957.029s">See,</a> when I was growing up, a funeral parlor is solemn to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3962.07s">It's</a> like a chapel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3963.991s">Why</a> they would place kiosks in front of certain places like in Sincardi's or Gaffey's, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3973.047s">where</a> there are other stores available in the area, and why none at other places? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3978.588s">There</a> should be none at all in any of these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3981.349s">There</a> should be no kiosks in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3983.79s">But</a> the point I want to make is, who came up with this decision to put this here and that there? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3990.011s">No</a> kiosks on Main Street all the way from Medford Square to the corner of Wright Avenue and Yale Street, and then stopping at Wareham Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4001.254s">I</a> mean, it's a small square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4003.86s">It's,</a> it's, it's vulnerable to going out of business down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4007.221s">There's</a> people that are, that are struggling, but yet there's convenience, convenient food markets that have none in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4014.083s">I,</a> I, I find it hard to believe that anybody would put a program together like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4019.504s">And</a> I'm sure that the people sitting on the council really didn't have much to do with the placement of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4026.206s">I'm</a> pretty sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4026.846s">I</a> know they didn't, but I just don't understand the concept, the idea and how it was put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4032.369s">I</a> also think it's unconscionable that kiosks are put where people worship, where parents go to pick up their children at the library or at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4039.632s">And</a> that two hour and less free parking is available in certain areas and other areas have kiosks and patrons who are required to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4049.997s">No</a> enforcement on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4051.697s">That's</a> another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4053.038s">Why</a> wouldn't it be prudent to have no enforcement on Saturdays except for permitted streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4059.561s">Because</a> on Saturday, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4061.107s">Most</a> of the mom and pops, most of the small cash and carries, most of the hair salons, the nail salons, everybody that's in business, that's when they do a brisk business on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4069.993s">Everybody's</a> home for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4072.095s">Everybody</a> is out shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4073.876s">So</a> why do they need to be punished to pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4076.658s">And</a> then on Sunday, there's no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4081.282s">And</a> here's a fact for you to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4084.244s">On</a> Sunday spells disaster for our neighborhoods that have permit parking in opposition on the periphery <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4090.878s">of</a> the smallest squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4093.239s">Most</a> businesses are closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4094.56s">It's</a> a family day, and we will have to put up with noise, more noise, incorrectly parked vehicles, blocked driveways, more garbage thrown on the streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4104.684s">Then</a> there's trying to hold spaces for expected company. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4108.086s">Is</a> this what we get for our tax dollars, a demise of our quality of life? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4113.288s">And</a> here's a real eye-opener, and I don't get this one at all, a 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4117.75s">start</a> time for enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4121.25s">Where</a> did that come up from 7 o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4123.932s">How</a> many people are on the road going to their jobs and typically stop at certain stores to grab a coffee, a scratch ticket, or some other commodity? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4131.516s">Why</a> are certain businesses being punished? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4133.917s">Hell,</a> they'll go someplace else, and who suffers?

<a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6745.556s">Listen,</a> seriously, this parking thing is wrong from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6750.597s">Councilor</a> Knight, you made a very interesting statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6752.437s">You</a> said you had it in your hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6754.038s">We're</a> discussing this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6756.089s">We</a> could have made the change if we could have done this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6758.271s">What</a> happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6758.751s">Nothing</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6761.194s">We</a> could have gone to Chevalier or the McGlynn School or something that had a huge citywide meeting like they did for the Green Line and have the questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6770.302s">This</a> is too quick for too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6773.745s">I</a> think the repercussions from this are going to be grand and I'm still against <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6781.367s">citizens</a> in Medford having to pay for parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6783.708s">We</a> pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6784.448s">We</a> pay an excise tax that should have been talked about many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6788.589s">And</a> it's on our backs to pay an excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6791.129s">If</a> you pay an excise tax, we should get a sticker that says you're a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6795.331s">It</a> gives you the ability to park anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6796.931s">I</a> don't even know if charging citizens to park in their own streets is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6801.152s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6801.532s">Is</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6802.052s">Does</a> anybody know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6803.453s">But</a> this whole thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6806.163s">As</a> far as your question with them about did they have any discussion of preferences about if they had a parking area there, I think the citizens and the business owners of Medford show a lot of respect, especially to Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6817.549s">So</a> they're not going to embarrass him in front of this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6820.41s">But</a> the thing you have to understand is Republic is a public company. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6824.898s">They</a> sit in that boardroom and they see those numbers, just like when Staple says, okay, close that store, close this store. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6830.041s">They're</a> going to say, hey, start kicking the numbers up and you're going to see stuff, stuff happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6835.525s">I</a> mean, this is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6836.546s">It's</a> just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6838.127s">Store</a> owners, a group of guys got together and they resolved this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6843.29s">Very</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6845.152s">And</a> to put it down in a little more micro, um, causal that the problem we have in the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6854.237s">with</a> the parking is actually enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6856.34s">It's</a> not the chief's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6857.642s">It's</a> the fact that most of the money goes to the school department and we can't put 20 police officers that we need in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6864.155s">We</a> need to have police officers on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6867.237s">We</a> need to have the right amount of people in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6869.759s">It's</a> very important, especially in today's time with what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6873.802s">So</a> we have to find a way to cut here and put here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6878.465s">And</a> then this problem may start to go away without bringing in a private enterprise that's going to show you what a private enterprise is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6887.751s">And</a> I just think it's so hard for the business owners now to try to keep their heads afloat, their heads above water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6894.45s">And</a> now this is a detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6895.75s">This</a> is like being punished to go and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6898.411s">So</a> anyway, next time around, you know, let's have a, let's do this right the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6904.612s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6905.292s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4835.346s">I</a> feel like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4837.006s">No,</a> but I mean, I just want it to work right, and I want it to benefit everybody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4840.649s">And</a> I want it to benefit the people that are coming into the city, to patronize the shops and the schools and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4847.395s">But</a> maybe, you say, maybe republic will get out there on them now to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4851.598s">Well,</a> it should. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4852.159s">And</a> I hope that it is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4853.86s">It</a> is done, because it's an important part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4855.782s">Well,</a> good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4856.943s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4857.523s">And</a> I'm looking forward to a public meeting.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6493.467s">That</a> is a very difficult situation over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6495.427s">You</a> have the cars on the opposite side heading towards Medford Square trying to get into the parking spots on the opposite side, and it is at a different angle than just going diagonally into the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6508.932s">You</a> do have the double parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6510.112s">You</a> do have the trucks, the deliveries when you have the liquor store getting whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6517.074s">They</a> have no other place to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6519.706s">One</a> of the concerns I have is when people are trying to back out of that spot where they're all head in parking, there are no mirrors that you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6529.03s">They</a> have the convex mirrors, and you can see the cars coming down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6534.212s">Right</a> now, if you're familiar with it, you know how to play the traffic off the store windows if you can see down past the Airstreet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6542.595s">But</a> I mean, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6544.336s">It's</a> a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6545.396s">There</a> have been a few fender benders, but thankfully nobody's really gotten hurt there, but it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6550.983s">I</a> always learned that you can't take the left turn on a double yellow line, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6555.407s">So</a> if there's an accident, I don't know who's at fault, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6558.329s">But</a> yeah, it is difficult when it double parks and when they try to take that turn because what happens is it starts to back up traffic at the intersection of Main and Harbord. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6566.596s">And</a> then you've got people stuck in the light and the light changes and then, you know, everybody's beeping horn to it and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6571.68s">But</a> the thing would be nice if they did have some, one or two mirrors when you're backing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6577.605s">You</a> can look at the mirror and see traffic coming from up, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6580.73s">down</a> from the Princeton Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6582.651s">So,</a> but yes, that is, that is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6585.412s">That</a> is a problem.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U/2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U.html">Medford City Council - Nov. 29, 2011</a></h2>
