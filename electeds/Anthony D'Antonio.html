href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11712.148s">First,</a> I want to say that a comment that was made by, I can't think of her name right now, about the CPA funds that Cameron, Roberta Cameron, just to <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11725.245s">let</a> people know that those CPA funds are property owners' tax money that they're charged a surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11733.488s">This</a> came about about five or six years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11736.489s">We</a> were supposed to get rebates, matching funds from the state, but the state has stiffed the city of Medford and others for the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11744.492s">So</a> that's our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11746.653s">It</a> appeared that this money was coming out of the sky, you know, just dropping down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11750.074s">No,</a> it's our money, our property owners' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11752.995s">So</a> now, <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11756.004s">I</a> have, it's not gonna take long to say this, but I've been listening and watching, and I've been in Medford for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11762.41s">I've</a> been around the world, I've been in different

gonna present my little treatise here, and I hope you got your seatbelts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11781.547s">to</a> say that I am disappointed and angry, but not surprised in the least by the actions, attitudes, and discriminatory accusations towards our citizens that the current irresponsible and questionable motions being brought by the sitting council this evening is monumentally understated. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11802.465s">The</a> sitting council members <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11804.423s">supported,</a> endorsed, and financed by the progressive socialist group Our Revolution, has furtively laid the groundwork to target and punish Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11814.566s">In</a> particular, homeowners, business owners, taxpayers, and workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11819.248s">That's</a> just about everyone except themselves and their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11822.589s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11823.83s">You</a> have drawn that infamous red line in the sand, creating a schism <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11828.55s">which</a> is, for all intents and purposes, the systematic and ultimate degradation of a city, along with its people, that stands proud, friendly, productive, prosperous, caring, diverse, in our favorite word, inclusive, for more years than most of you have walked the earth, but many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11846.775s">You</a> exercise ambiguous language when you attempt to introduce us to national political agendas under the guise of, it's good for Medford, when in fact it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11857.339s">Your</a> efforts in these matters are not welcome, as are not your attempts to indoctrinate the Medford to a socialist system, not here, not now, not ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11867.243s">I</a> am steadfast in declaring that I have very little faith <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11871.344s">If</a> any at all in all in your abilities to perform your duties as city Councilors, your lack of experience in life circus is pretty evident verbosity is not a substitute for performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11882.894s">We</a> are not fooled, and we are not fools. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11886.878s">Understand</a> this. <a

contributed to and for the betterment of Medford, are the people who you work for, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11900.502s">We</a> are not your property. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11902.363s">I</a> refuse, as I hope we all do, to be treated as fodder for your political ideologies and schemes, none which are beneficial for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11911.267s">This</a> is not the place for you to build your curriculum vitae on the backs in the bank accounts <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11917.327s">of</a> Medford citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11919.028s">What</a> gives you the audacity to assume such? <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11922.05s">Your</a> responsibility as city councilors when you took the oath of office was to ensure that we have a city made safe for its residents, schools, students, visitors, good streets, sidewalks, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, to welcome and support businesses so that they may flourish in also as important, if not most importantly, financial integrity, discipline, and acuity, which we are sorely lacking. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11945.265s">Fix</a> this first. <a href="https://youtu.be/XMyVKWwRIL8&t=11947.047s">Don't</a> burden us financially because we have a weak, ineffective, and irresponsible administration, and you lack the tools and experience needed to mitigate this problem. <a

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1342.433s">My</a> name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1345.294s">It's</a> like a church in here, so quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1347.295s">Not</a> that I would know, but anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1349.257s">I'm</a> glad you brought this up, Councilor Bears, because I wanted to bring up something that we did several years ago when Chief Sacker was around. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1358.942s">terrible</a> parking problems down in South Medford, down on Yale Harbor, Main Street and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1364.665s">We</a> started at the Kennedy Condominiums, a group of neighbors, must have been about 20 of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1373.549s">We</a> walked the whole neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1374.91s">We</a> walked and saw the situation, the problems that we were experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1380.312s">We</a> wound up all the way down to Columbus Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1384.294s">The</a> problem you have is one of the things that's increased the traffic <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1388.786s">to</a> cut through traffic is when they put that juggernaut across from the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1395.108s">People</a> don't want to go down there, wait for the turn, take a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1398.409s">They're</a> going down to Alexander Avenue now, or cutting across Harvard, and then they're zooming down to Willis Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1403.651s">It's</a> really dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1404.691s">And</a> the children there, I mean, the poor traffic supervisors there, they put their lives at risk over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1410.493s">I</a> mean, I can hear them yelling at the people in the morning sometimes, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1414.594s">But</a> for every solution, <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1418.186s">the</a> way the city is right now, it creates a problem on another part of that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1423.791s">Because</a> I don't really see any solution to divert all the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1428.494s">All</a> I see is a heavy duty, a heavy hand in enforcement, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1433.398s">Because</a> that may defer or deter some of the activities that are going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1439.183s">It</a> is, you know, I'm out five o'clock in the morning walking my dog and I bring a light and I have to flash it when I cross Willis Ave because they're flying up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1448.359s">Like</a> Councilor Beall said, if they're not doing 50, they're not doing anything, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1453.423s">And</a> even sometimes with the light, I think they must know where they wanna run me over because it'll slow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1459.728s">But</a> anyway, I think it would be great to get together because I don't think the traffic engineer or anybody would be able to go down there and say, okay, we're gonna do this because it has to be, you have to have all the voices, you have to have what the concerns are and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1473.854s">And</a> here's one thing that I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1476.116s">When</a> you're coming up Willis Avenue, and you're going to approach Hicks, or going to the left to go to Columbus School, or Missy's Steak, or Missy Tuck, you don't see the stop sign until you get right to the top of the rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1491.707s">And</a> that's dangerous, because people don't see the stop sign, so they're not slowing down. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1496.571s">They</a> got these great guys that take the corners really nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1499.673s">Somebody's</a> gonna get killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1502.133s">I</a> appreciate that, and I just wish that we would put something together so the neighbors can get together and say, here's our concerns, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1510.297s">And</a> see what happens from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1512.318s">By</a> the way, the Aisle Street parking lot, I mean, it's still a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1515.859s">It's</a> getting worse, just to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/XwD1TYSSFis&t=1517.5s">So,</a> thank you very much.<h2><a href="../2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14/2024-10-05_b-MzuLbfz14.html">City Council 05-23-23</a></h2>

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JN0LvnDt6wc&t=9422.078s">My</a> hope is, myself as an individual, can I go in there when the polls close and get a count on the candidates who received X amount of votes in that precinct?

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9768.617s">But,</a> in spite of the fact that I don't agree with any of the increases and I think that residents should have some kind of an I.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9775.822s">Card</a> maybe at a very minimum cost, I think that the least we should do is offer the membership free to our veterans and to our senior citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9786.37s">And,</a> is this, is it A.D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9789.352s">Compliant</a> up there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9794.512s">to</a> expand that in any way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9797.294s">With</a> the bathrooms, restrooms and everything to be an ADA certified?
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9807.66s">I</a> just think it's a great resource.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9814.924s">It</a> is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9815.444s">And</a> it's, you know, like we have the mystic river, but we haven't taken advantage of anything on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JknWFpZeyhQ&t=9821.208s">And,</a> <h2><a href="../2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg/2025-03-21_B5fALLGbAKg.html">Medford, MA City Council - June 2, 2015 (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4130.761s">Good</a> evening, Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4133.822s">Um,</a> we had a little bit of a discussion last week on this, but it's very important that we consider changing, reviewing the, the charter because, um, for instance, having in the last couple of weeks going, going over the ledgers of the city of Medford, looking at the budgets present past, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4160.186s">this</a> oversight is missing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4162.687s">And</a> we, you know, I hate to say this, but the spending in the city is almost like a drunken sailor. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4167.851s">And</a> I hate to use that clause, but I mean, I am amazed at what is being spent in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4173.516s">And</a> I hear people say, well, we can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4175.337s">We</a> can't do that because there's no money left. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4177.439s">There's</a> plenty of money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4179.06s">It's</a> just how we present our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4181.261s">But</a> the fact is that the council should have a strong say <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4186.306s">in</a> what we do when it comes to the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4187.847s">I'm</a> not saying yes or no on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4189.668s">I'm</a> saying why did you present this budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4191.929s">No,</a> go back and this is what you have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4194.19s">I</a> mean, has anybody got the actual title of the type of budgeting we process in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4201.053s">You</a> know, is it zero-based budgeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4204.175s">Is</a> it just, you know, adding on from last year's budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4207.857s">Because</a> one of the things I noticed is an awful lot of transfers and money, and that affects the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4213.465s">And</a> there shouldn't be that kind of excess money, surplus money in the budget to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4217.127s">But</a> the thing is that you have to have a balance of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4220.088s">You</a> can't have one individual running a city of 56,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4224.67s">And</a> I actually think there's a lot more than 56,000 people in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4228.372s">Because</a> we just had an article come out on the 26,000 housing units, housing stock, with this thing saying that we're below the affordable housing percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4241.134s">units</a> of housing, we have 56,000 residents in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4245.877s">How</a> do we only have 56,000 residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4249.72s">I</a> mean, if you take two times the 26,000, there's 52,000 people right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4256.165s">So</a> it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4257.586s">And</a> last week I talked to you through the chair, through Councilor Knight, you had asked me some information about the previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4264.771s">I</a> do recall, and I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4269.004s">to</a> the chair also, the city clerk may be able to confirm this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4271.926s">I</a> did post and time date the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4275.529s">Uh,</a> we did have other Councilors and other prospective Councilors come to the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4279.732s">The</a> minutes were, it was pretty much information that we gathered from the state and we passed on to each other and we read and looked at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4287.658s">And,</a> uh, then as I said, we got dumped on the, uh, on the issue before the council to pursue it any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4294.303s">But,</a> uh, as far as your request for the minutes, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4297.52s">I</a> mean, the minutes were basically just chapters, verses from the State, you know, the Department of Revenue, the Secretary of State, and some from the city itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4307.225s">But</a> we had interest in the charter review, and I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4311.667s">And</a> a point that was brought up was that with ward Councilors, I think the Councilors can do a better job in their wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4321.005s">It's</a> difficult to be a councilor at large because you've got all these people that need and have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4326.008s">I</a> mean, it's almost impossible to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4327.809s">I</a> mean, a councilor in itself is almost a 24 hour day, seven days a week job. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4334.632s">And</a> I think that the people deserve much better than we're getting now. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4338.794s">And</a> I'm not saying from the council, I'm saying from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4342.396s">And</a> I think, and I don't want people to think that because we're gonna have the city solicitor render an opinion on the charter, <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4350.581s">that</a> this is an ongoing process and the charter is now under review, because a lot of people asked me that question last week, and I said, no, it's just for the city solicitor to render an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4361.963s">So</a> please remember that, people that are listening out there, that it's only an opinion, and that it may mysteriously disappear after the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4371.085s">So</a> please be aware of that, and please, if you're serious about a charter review, let's get it on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/B5fALLGbAKg&t=4377.026s">Thank</a> you very much.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY/2025-03-21_ufxEwxM3_BY.html">Medford City Council - May 26, 2015</a></h2>

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7728.213s">Good</a> evening, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7729.254s">Anthony</a> D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7731.876s">I</a> can't remember how many months ago it was, but I started a committee, just a grassroots committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7740.502s">And</a> I have 57 members on it right now of people that were very much interested in reviewing the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7746.327s">It's</a> very important because it's a very old document. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7751.03s">I</a> know that Councilor Penta was on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7754.008s">At</a> the initial change from plan E to plan A, there were a lot of amendments left out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7762.73s">Amendments</a> that hurt the citizens of Medford because they weren't getting fair representation for their tax dollars, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7769.772s">But</a> I do recall when I came before, I had a discussion with Solicitor Rumley, and we had a miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7777.168s">And</a> I tried to get to him before he went on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7779.269s">He</a> took a long weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7780.55s">And</a> I came before the council somewhat unprepared, but the emotion that I was trying to get across was to get a feel from the councillors, would you be amenable to having a commission set up where I believe each one of your councillors can pick somebody to go on the, on the committee or the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7798.942s">And</a> it was shot down four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7802.064s">And</a> I think councillor Marchant voted for it, Penta and Biannalonga. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7808.117s">And</a> it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7809.218s">I</a> mean, I know it's an election year and I know, you know, this is the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7812.84s">It</a> was the right thing to do 10 years ago, 15 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7815.181s">I</a> mean, charter should review, be reviewed at least a minimum every five years because things change all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7821.765s">So</a> I just wanted to get that straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7824.507s">And</a> there are a lot of people from that committee that I started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7828.309s">There</a> were hundreds that want to see a review of the charter because they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7832.852s">They</a> don't understand why what happens here on Tuesday nights happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7837.459s">Why</a> don't you have authority to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7839.42s">Why</a> do we spend this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7840.24s">Why</a> do we need to be some changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7842.12s">We</a> need to have a balance of power. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7843.621s">So</a> there was a vote taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7845.521s">And</a> as I said, it got stuffed four to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7847.962s">So</a> anyway, that's all I wanted to say.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7973.789s">Anthony</a> D'Antonio, Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7976.971s">This</a> was an ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7980.444s">which</a> came about because of the frustration of many citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7983.345s">This</a> is not a, uh, you know, you don't have a charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7987.787s">We</a> just was a group of people to met.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7992.349s">No,</a> because what I, uh, what's happening now is because it's an election year and a lot of people busy with different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=7998.292s">Um,</a> and I have a couple of other avenues I've been, you know, going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8004.995s">I'm</a> hoping that the, um, the next administrator, the next mayor in the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8010.382s">We'll</a> understand that this needs to be done, and we'll go along with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8013.385s">It's</a> quite an operation to get this thing going. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8017.168s">I</a> think to go the signature way is 5,500 signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8021.131s">Then</a> there's a process with this, that, and the other, and it takes a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8023.833s">But</a> as I said, councilors can vote a commission, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, can vote a commission to work on the charter, and it needs a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8032.661s">There's</a> a lot of weak spots in the charter.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8053.18s">We</a> have some minutes of what we've done.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8056.303s">It's</a> not in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8057.004s">Pretty</a> much what we did, what we discussed was the need for the change in the charter or the review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8062.704s">And</a> not so much to besmirch the mayor or anything like that, because it's a very fine line when you're trying to work with somebody who's been mayor for 28 years in a charter that's been in existence from the year before he became mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8075.934s">So</a> it's a fine line, because there's a lot of different opinions of everything and everybody out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8081.518s">And</a> that was difficult, because we shook out the people that just wanted to come in and lambaste the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8085.48s">We</a> didn't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8086.938s">And</a> then, you know, so it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8090.079s">The</a> goal was to get this city back in the, back in the green and the black and everything.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8137.36s">And</a> as I said, it is a committee, ad hoc, and not a commission, not a duly registered commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/ufxEwxM3_BY&t=8143.364s">Thank</a> you, Mr. D'Antonio.

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4099.849s">Anthony</a> D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4103.189s">40</a> years ago today, and tomorrow, and on Thursday, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4107.358s">We</a> had a Medford resident, who is now a 30-year member of the Medford Police Department, standing on the rooftop of the embassy in Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4117.605s">This</a> evening at 9 o'clock on the PBS station, public broadcasting, they're going to have a documentary called The Last Days of Vietnam. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4127.311s">We</a> have a hero amidst us again, as we do quite a few times in the city of Medford, and that person is John Galane. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4133.996s">And</a> he's over there in Saigon right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4136.265s">commemorating</a> this occasion. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4138.527s">John</a> was one of the last to get on a chopper from the rooftops. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4142.089s">He</a> was getting on a chopper as he saw the tanks coming down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4146.833s">The</a> North Vietnamese were coming down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4150.236s">It's</a> similar to what Lieutenant Colonel Harold Moore did in La Trang, Vietnam in 65 in November, when he was the last man off of the first major battle we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4159.062s">However,</a> the difference was that the 1st Battalion, 7th Calvary had decimated the enemy. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4165.783s">John</a> Ghislaine was facing the enemy coming down the street, and he was one of the last two or three. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4171.305s">And</a> I'd also like to say that at that attack and before the attack that we lost two Marines over there, Darwin Judge from Marshalltown, Iowa, and Charles McMahon from Woburn, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4181.829s">I</a> think it's a good piece of living history for the people of Medford to see what this gentleman did, John Ghislaine, as a Marine over there in Vietnam. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4192.79s">It's</a> just something that we cannot forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4195.433s">I</a> get so dismayed with seeing things that are being taught to our students today, and it's revisionist history, and nothing is being brought up like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4202.921s">But</a> I think that John and all the guys, all the Marines that are over there deserve our appreciation for what they did 40 years ago today. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4211.131s">And</a> Semper Fi, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/V22AEle-x6o&t=4212.993s">Thank</a> you.

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10762.94s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10763.64s">There's</a> a lot of other issues there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10766.456s">I'll</a> wait until this meeting comes up, but I just wanted to say that there's a net, the net results so far on the permit parking is negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10772.978s">We're</a> not getting the enforcement and we're getting more people from Somerville parking on the side streets where there's permit parking because there's no enforcement and you can't blame the police because they don't know, they don't have the information, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/pkk5OxKuY6w&t=10784.06s">So</a> thank you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E/2025-03-21_bfXSmZAO02E.html">Medford City Council - March 31, 2015  (Unofficially provided by MT)</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7478.419s">We</a> knock off the parking enforcement Friday and Saturday so that the vendors and the businesses that do a lot of the business, especially on this coming holiday weekend, get a little bit back. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7488.786s">I</a> think the city owes it to them because you can't do anything about the snow, but we can certainly do something about this terribly implemented parking program because it wasn't ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7497.232s">It</a> was not ready for prime time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7499.274s">And</a> if anybody should get a ticket, then on the, uh, onus of Republic that they, <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7506.462s">not</a> only reimbursed, I just canceled the tickets out, but give the people a chance to do some shopping again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7513.166s">I</a> mean, it's like a ghost town out there, you know, on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7516.528s">Now,</a> a week ago, we had the leprechaun race. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7518.609s">That's</a> a great cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7519.569s">I</a> mean, that's, I have no qualms with that, but maybe the next time, maybe do it on a Sunday or something, because that also affected the businesses because I didn't realize the enormity of the blockages to get into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7531.216s">Usually</a> I can, I can get into the square by all the sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7533.997s">They</a> had everything blocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7536.594s">It</a> was a good event, but then again, it also affects other people, the same way as the bridge is going to affect a lot of the store owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7544.116s">And</a> I still want to see why they want to put the bridge there. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7548.538s">And</a> I want to see where the safety issues are. <a href="https://youtu.be/bfXSmZAO02E&t=7550.598s">Why</a> are we letting buses go over it?

<a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5706.529s">I</a> mean, if it's a million dollars, it normally is going to take a three year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5709.911s">And</a> I think it's time for the city to say, okay, thanks for the time you put into this, but this is not for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5716.513s">We</a> have to find a different solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5718.374s">There</a> are other solutions out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5720.234s">And</a> unfortunately it requires a lot of personnel on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5723.876s">And</a> it also requires a mayor who can get the money from one <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5727.776s">and</a> put into a budget where we need public safety officers, we need DPW people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5732.419s">I</a> mean, there's a lot of things that can be done, but this just doesn't, and there's nothing against the Republic Parking System. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5738.283s">I</a> mean, they're all good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5739.184s">They</a> have a bottom line they have to meet, but this is always the way the city runs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5744.908s">The</a> mayor doesn't like what some people do, and he comes up with his own plan, and then he, you know, he hits Mrs. Murphy's car on the rear wrench, opens the pond door, and you guys are all chasing the car down the street as well as the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5756.974s">And</a> it's the wrong way to run a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5759.495s">And</a> that's because this charter has not been reviewed for 30 years in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5764.196s">There's</a> absolute power in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5766.077s">And</a> to expect anything else, like Charlie Brown always thought that Lucy was going to hold the football when he goes to kick it, but she always moves it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5773.019s">That's</a> what we have with this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5775.579s">You</a> don't get what we're paying for here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5777.34s">We</a> have to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5779.04s">And</a> people have to be made aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5780.541s">We've</a> got to stop all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5783.762s">Well,</a> never mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5784.842s">Anyway.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5786.177s">I</a> hope that the people understand that there are a lot of pros and cons with these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5792.282s">And</a> I've seen a lot of people having difficulty, a lot of difficulty with the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5796.825s">It's</a> a hell of a lot easier to put a quarter and a card, a credit card in those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5802.99s">And</a> one thing I think I heard one of the representatives from Republic say that the information is secure when you put your license plate number in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5813.438s">And</a> I strongly disagree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5817.088s">There</a> is no information that's secure once it goes into the cloud, or it goes into the airways, or it goes into the software, because there are companies out there that do this particularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5826.993s">I</a> could take Mr. Nash up to a place in New Hampshire and show him his own company in a particular data aggregator, and they won't even know that they're being looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5836.318s">And</a> I have a feeling that it's not their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5839.62s">It's</a> just the way the society is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5841.741s">But</a> anyway, I really hope that— Point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5849.867s">No,</a> no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5853.65s">To</a> give you an example, Groupon sells coupons for golf memberships and causes special discounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5861.677s">Well,</a> you can go up there and they can go right into their system and see who's signing the coupons. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5866.715s">So</a> what happens is you manufacture golf clubs, you come to me, I sell you a list, the people that are buying the memberships to the golf course.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5881.479s">They</a> can't sell it.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5882.62s">They</a> won't.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5888.342s">I</a> said I could take you to a company in New Hampshire that does this, and they could go into the site.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5901.671s">I</a> just think a little more consideration on behalf of the mayor should have been taken for the people in the city of Medford.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5906.634s">I</a> thought you said that I misinterpreted what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5909.834s">No,</a> it's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5910.555s">I</a> mean, these are companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5911.435s">They</a> pay big money for people to come in and do this, to do the software. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5913.997s">I</a> mean, they have computers that will fill this room, and that's all they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5917.58s">That's</a> how they make their money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5918.441s">You've</a> probably seen emails that should come to your email address that you have no idea how they got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5923.265s">That's</a> how it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5923.945s">They</a> sell the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5925.767s">Well,</a> thank you, and good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5927.869s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5928.169s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Fcwn-qU-L9c&t=5929.79s">Councilor</a> Knight?<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk/2025-03-21_pC-1P_58AJk.html">Medford City Council - January 13, 2015</a></h2>
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9559.208s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9559.768s">Please</a> state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9561.449s">My</a> name is Anthony D'Antonio of Yale Street, number 12 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9566.911s">And</a> I'm just another one of those irate citizens right about now, because I can't believe <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9573.441s">that</a> this city has gone forward with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9576.723s">It's</a> astounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9577.504s">I</a> mean, this is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9578.725s">I</a> said it last week, it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9580.746s">And</a> I have to come up here, and if I have to come up every week on a different issue with this parking program, which is actually a revenue enforcement program, I will do it under a different subject, because something's got to be done.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9608.12s">What</a> is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9609.0s">We're</a> made to believe that all these years that we were able to park in the streets, that we were supposed to bow down and say, well, thank you for letting us park in your streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9617.344s">Now,</a> if you have to go with these kiosks, and I see dozens of people, elderly people, young people, still having difficulty with the kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9627.408s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9627.808s">You</a> said you saw people in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9629.329s">I</a> mean, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9630.309s">But</a> I see people having great difficulty here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9632.993s">So</a> the thing is you don't put the money in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9634.755s">You</a> get a ticket, you're forced to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9636.717s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9637.258s">It</a> comes into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9638.639s">This</a> is, this is not the right way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9640.662s">I</a> mean, citizens will put up with it for a period of time, but it's, I had a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9646.428s">I</a> had two businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9648.71s">The</a> Councilors have businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9651.053s">You,</a> if you don't know how to run a business, what it takes to run a business, <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9654.93s">There's</a> no compassion for the people out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9657.811s">I</a> mean, the Chamber of Commerce, you know, for this particular program should be called the Chamber of Horrors. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9662.574s">I</a> mean, what have they done to this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9664.895s">I</a> mean, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9665.735s">And</a> I feel bad that Chief Sacco has to come up here also. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9668.676s">The</a> mayor should be sitting right here and taking the heat for this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9672.258s">And</a> I want the citizens of Medford to know whose fathers, or who's with the mayor, and who's with the program, and what are you going to do for the citizens? <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9679.662s">Because</a> it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9681.042s">I</a> mean, Harvard Street and Main Street, it was crowded all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9685.032s">There</a> was nobody up there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9686.712s">They're</a> gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9687.513s">People</a> are complaining about businesses, even the Oasis Restaurant, one of the busiest places around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9692.214s">He's</a> already dipped because they don't—these guys, they work hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9695.575s">They</a> don't want a $25 ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9697.575s">I</a> mean, that's a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9698.335s">It's</a> coming out of their pockets. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9699.716s">It's</a> coming out of the table, food, clothing for their children and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9703.256s">So</a> it's got to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9704.757s">It's</a> got to be every week until something happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9707.517s">I</a> would think that I would like to see a hold put on to the start of this program because <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9714.59s">We're</a> not ready for it, the citizens are not ready for it, and the businesses are already starting to pay the price. <a href="https://youtu.be/pC-1P_58AJk&t=9719.852s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ/2025-03-21_KvW9uYtSUXQ.html">Medford City Council - January 6, 2015</a></h2>

<a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3853.308s">For</a> what purpose do they exist and for whom do they serve? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3856.596s">They</a> stood by mutely and watched as certain businesses remained free and clear of kiosks, while other businesses did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3863.981s">Some</a> politicians lack business experience and business sense, not all but some. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3869.125s">But</a> the smart ones, the ones who truly recognize it is their responsibility to work on behalf of the citizenry, will reach out and put the business paradigm on the table in an open forum, not behind closed doors at the expense of the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3884.876s">Why,</a> for instance? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3886.083s">And</a> please take note that I am objectively pointing out examples, free of any animosity, and as neutral as I can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3894.029s">But</a> I need to make this point by example. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3896.771s">Why</a> do we place kiosks in the center of West Medford Square, but have none as you enter from Arlington? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3903.135s">Examples</a> given, Joe's Peach and Charles Liquors, in the block of stores as you approach Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3909.099s">By</a> the way, I received a text earlier today from Joan Gatto, who is the owner and proprietor of <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3915.125s">magnificent</a> muffin. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3916.366s">She</a> is out of town and wanted me to express her concern on this particular program, as well as the concern she has for her other business colleagues in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3926.474s">Now</a> to continue, I have to make a statement here and it is with all due respect and it concerns the placement and not placement of kiosks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3943.846s">and</a> several business establishments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3947.207s">I</a> have been a long friend to the Dello Russo family in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3954.108s">I</a> have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3956.709s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3957.029s">See,</a> when I was growing up, a funeral parlor is solemn to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3962.07s">It's</a> like a chapel. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3963.991s">Why</a> they would place kiosks in front of certain places like in Sincardi's or Gaffey's, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3973.047s">where</a> there are other stores available in the area, and why none at other places? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3978.588s">There</a> should be none at all in any of these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3981.349s">There</a> should be no kiosks in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3983.79s">But</a> the point I want to make is, who came up with this decision to put this here and that there? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=3990.011s">No</a> kiosks on Main Street all the way from Medford Square to the corner of Wright Avenue and Yale Street, and then stopping at Wareham Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4001.254s">I</a> mean, it's a small square. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4003.86s">It's,</a> it's, it's vulnerable to going out of business down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4007.221s">There's</a> people that are, that are struggling, but yet there's convenience, convenient food markets that have none in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4014.083s">I,</a> I, I find it hard to believe that anybody would put a program together like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4019.504s">And</a> I'm sure that the people sitting on the council really didn't have much to do with the placement of the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4026.206s">I'm</a> pretty sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4026.846s">I</a> know they didn't, but I just don't understand the concept, the idea and how it was put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4032.369s">I</a> also think it's unconscionable that kiosks are put where people worship, where parents go to pick up their children at the library or at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4039.632s">And</a> that two hour and less free parking is available in certain areas and other areas have kiosks and patrons who are required to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4049.997s">No</a> enforcement on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4051.697s">That's</a> another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4053.038s">Why</a> wouldn't it be prudent to have no enforcement on Saturdays except for permitted streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4059.561s">Because</a> on Saturday, <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4061.107s">Most</a> of the mom and pops, most of the small cash and carries, most of the hair salons, the nail salons, everybody that's in business, that's when they do a brisk business on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4069.993s">Everybody's</a> home for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4072.095s">Everybody</a> is out shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4073.876s">So</a> why do they need to be punished to pay? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4076.658s">And</a> then on Sunday, there's no enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4081.282s">And</a> here's a fact for you to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4084.244s">On</a> Sunday spells disaster for our neighborhoods that have permit parking in opposition on the periphery <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4090.878s">of</a> the smallest squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4093.239s">Most</a> businesses are closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4094.56s">It's</a> a family day, and we will have to put up with noise, more noise, incorrectly parked vehicles, blocked driveways, more garbage thrown on the streets and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4104.684s">Then</a> there's trying to hold spaces for expected company. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4108.086s">Is</a> this what we get for our tax dollars, a demise of our quality of life? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4113.288s">And</a> here's a real eye-opener, and I don't get this one at all, a 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4117.75s">start</a> time for enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4121.25s">Where</a> did that come up from 7 o'clock? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4123.932s">How</a> many people are on the road going to their jobs and typically stop at certain stores to grab a coffee, a scratch ticket, or some other commodity? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4131.516s">Why</a> are certain businesses being punished? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4133.917s">Hell,</a> they'll go someplace else, and who suffers? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4136.018s">We</a> all do. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4137.539s">This</a> program is lacking true parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4141.041s">Can</a> you not see this? <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4143.162s">In</a> closing, I stand by my belief and on my own as a concerned citizen <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4148.283s">in</a> a former mayoral candidate and former business owner outside the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4152.886s">This</a> is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4154.167s">This</a> is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4155.247s">This</a> is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/KvW9uYtSUXQ&t=4156.168s">Thank</a> you.

<a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6745.556s">Listen,</a> seriously, this parking thing is wrong from day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6750.597s">Councilor</a> Knight, you made a very interesting statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6752.437s">You</a> said you had it in your hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6754.038s">We're</a> discussing this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6756.089s">We</a> could have made the change if we could have done this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6758.271s">What</a> happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6758.751s">Nothing</a> happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6761.194s">We</a> could have gone to Chevalier or the McGlynn School or something that had a huge citywide meeting like they did for the Green Line and have the questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6770.302s">This</a> is too quick for too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6773.745s">I</a> think the repercussions from this are going to be grand and I'm still against <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6781.367s">citizens</a> in Medford having to pay for parking permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6783.708s">We</a> pay taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6784.448s">We</a> pay an excise tax that should have been talked about many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6788.589s">And</a> it's on our backs to pay an excise tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6791.129s">If</a> you pay an excise tax, we should get a sticker that says you're a Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6795.331s">It</a> gives you the ability to park anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6796.931s">I</a> don't even know if charging citizens to park in their own streets is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6801.152s">I</a> don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6801.532s">Is</a> it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6802.052s">Does</a> anybody know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6803.453s">But</a> this whole thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6806.163s">As</a> far as your question with them about did they have any discussion of preferences about if they had a parking area there, I think the citizens and the business owners of Medford show a lot of respect, especially to Chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6817.549s">So</a> they're not going to embarrass him in front of this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6820.41s">But</a> the thing you have to understand is Republic is a public company. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6824.898s">They</a> sit in that boardroom and they see those numbers, just like when Staple says, okay, close that store, close this store. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6830.041s">They're</a> going to say, hey, start kicking the numbers up and you're going to see stuff, stuff happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6835.525s">I</a> mean, this is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6836.546s">It's</a> just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6838.127s">Store</a> owners, a group of guys got together and they resolved this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6843.29s">Very</a> simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6845.152s">And</a> to put it down in a little more micro, um, causal that the problem we have in the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6854.237s">with</a> the parking is actually enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6856.34s">It's</a> not the chief's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6857.642s">It's</a> the fact that most of the money goes to the school department and we can't put 20 police officers that we need in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6864.155s">We</a> need to have police officers on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6867.237s">We</a> need to have the right amount of people in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6869.759s">It's</a> very important, especially in today's time with what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6873.802s">So</a> we have to find a way to cut here and put here. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6878.465s">And</a> then this problem may start to go away without bringing in a private enterprise that's going to show you what a private enterprise is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6887.751s">And</a> I just think it's so hard for the business owners now to try to keep their heads afloat, their heads above water. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6894.45s">And</a> now this is a detriment. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6895.75s">This</a> is like being punished to go and shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6898.411s">So</a> anyway, next time around, you know, let's have a, let's do this right the next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6904.612s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/QuIJp-vSiqo&t=6905.292s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as/2025-03-21_uLCwC5-x-as.html">Medford City Council - December 16, 2014</a></h2>
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2813.412s">Good</a> evening, Anthony D'Antonio, excuse me, Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2819.173s">You</a> know, it happens every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2821.174s">The</a> budget comes out, we all argue over the numbers, rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2826.476s">The</a> problem exists at the conception of the budget, which, having moved back here to Medford several years back and watched how it operates, I'm disgusted with how this budget gets put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2839.083s">You</a> can say and defend everybody and anybody you want, but <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2843.846s">that</a> nobody's worrying about the person who's on a fixed income right now, who's probably at home sweating, saying, am I going to be able to buy prescription drugs after this tax increase goes through? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2851.951s">They're</a> making $1,100 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2854.673s">Figure</a> that and having a household that they own. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2857.984s">You</a> have to put yourselves in their shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2859.505s">A</a> lot of times, elected officials, you're not affected by the laws that you create, by the rules, by the budgets, because you get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2867.232s">You</a> can handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2868.293s">You've</a> got that money coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2869.714s">And</a> I don't mean that in a derogatory manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2871.736s">I'm</a> saying that people do not have it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2875.059s">Electric</a> rates are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2876.54s">Water</a> rates are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2877.902s">Everything's</a> going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2878.823s">Big</a> deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2879.944s">The</a> fuel and everything is going down right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2882.025s">Just</a> wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2882.706s">Watch</a> what happens after. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2884.205s">It's</a> not going to be last forever, but you've got to stop working for the administration and work for the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2889.928s">When</a> you say you do it, do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2892.229s">I</a> mean, the majority of the council does not work for the people in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2896.351s">And</a> I'm disappointed in that because it affects everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2899.592s">It</a> affects people that want to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2901.633s">And</a> we're just, you're not looking at the total picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2904.035s">And</a> as far as the new administration coming in, it's time that we have a change in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2908.677s">It's</a> time that we get somebody that maybe has to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2911.275s">It's</a> time for you cities and towns to take on some of this fiscal responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2915.197s">This</a> is insanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2916.318s">You</a> can't keep putting your hand in my pocket, in my neighbor's pocket, and everybody else in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2921.96s">You</a> gotta do it at the onset, where it counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2924.682s">And</a> if you tell me you can't find room to cut the budget and make it a better city, then you're not doing your job because it's there, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=2932.866s">Maybe</a> they ought to start reading a book on it.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=5622.184s">No.</a> 
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11462.017s">Was</a> that vote all taken care of?

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11538.02s">So</a> then the placards we have now are grandfathered in until that date?
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11567.641s">That's</a> good. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11568.161s">That's</a> good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11569.342s">I</a> have other things to say about the parking program, but I had enough for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/uLCwC5-x-as&t=11573.926s">Thank</a> you, everybody.

 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4707.254s">Excuse</a> me. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4708.575s">Anthony</a> Antonio, Yale street number 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4712.037s">Um,</a> just a couple of comments on the parking enforcement program, revenue and revenue program. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4718.12s">Um,</a> I was never in favor of going out to a third party or a subcontractor to do this for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4724.443s">I</a> always felt very strongly that we were capable enough to do it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4727.99s">I</a> always felt that within the city of Medford, this would have been handled with a lot of respect for the citizens and the store owners in this city and with common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4741.394s">And</a> I see that this is somewhat lacking in this particular contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4745.575s">I</a> am still waiting, unless I missed it somewhere along the line, for the analysis between in-house versus <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4752.499s">outside</a> contracting as far as the cost analysis on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4755.96s">I</a> think that an implementation of a parking program where we're going to capitalize a particular company with equipment, and I don't mean that we're going to pay for the equipment, but it's a lot easier to get into a contract than it is to get out of a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4769.003s">And</a> if this thing is not working properly, and if this thing is not realizing the money that we think that we're going to get, how do you get out of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4777.885s">And</a> you brought up a very good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4780.326s">There's</a> been snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4782.239s">on</a> curbs and on the sidewalks until end of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4788.064s">I</a> can't understand how people that are handicapped, people that have elderly people like myself, you know, I mean, really, how are you going to get up and put the money in the slot, put the money in the kiosk? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4799.435s">That's</a> an important part. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4800.375s">You've</a> got to clean these parking lots and you've got to clean the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4803.879s">We</a> need the people to do that.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4830.243s">And</a> I agree.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4835.346s">I</a> feel like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4837.006s">No,</a> but I mean, I just want it to work right, and I want it to benefit everybody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4840.649s">And</a> I want it to benefit the people that are coming into the city, to patronize the shops and the schools and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4847.395s">But</a> maybe, you say, maybe republic will get out there on them now to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4851.598s">Well,</a> it should. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4852.159s">And</a> I hope that it is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4853.86s">It</a> is done, because it's an important part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4855.782s">Well,</a> good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4856.943s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=4857.523s">And</a> I'm looking forward to a public meeting.
 <p>[Anthony D'Antonio]: <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6493.467s">That</a> is a very difficult situation over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6495.427s">You</a> have the cars on the opposite side heading towards Medford Square trying to get into the parking spots on the opposite side, and it is at a different angle than just going diagonally into the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6508.932s">You</a> do have the double parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6510.112s">You</a> do have the trucks, the deliveries when you have the liquor store getting whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6517.074s">They</a> have no other place to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6519.706s">One</a> of the concerns I have is when people are trying to back out of that spot where they're all head in parking, there are no mirrors that you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6529.03s">They</a> have the convex mirrors, and you can see the cars coming down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6534.212s">Right</a> now, if you're familiar with it, you know how to play the traffic off the store windows if you can see down past the Airstreet. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6542.595s">But</a> I mean, it's a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6544.336s">It's</a> a gamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6545.396s">There</a> have been a few fender benders, but thankfully nobody's really gotten hurt there, but it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6550.983s">I</a> always learned that you can't take the left turn on a double yellow line, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6555.407s">So</a> if there's an accident, I don't know who's at fault, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6558.329s">But</a> yeah, it is difficult when it double parks and when they try to take that turn because what happens is it starts to back up traffic at the intersection of Main and Harbord. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6566.596s">And</a> then you've got people stuck in the light and the light changes and then, you know, everybody's beeping horn to it and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6571.68s">But</a> the thing would be nice if they did have some, one or two mirrors when you're backing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6577.605s">You</a> can look at the mirror and see traffic coming from up, <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6580.73s">down</a> from the Princeton Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6582.651s">So,</a> but yes, that is, that is a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/A8ucl-IFfU8&t=6585.412s">That</a> is a problem.<h2><a href="../2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U/2025-03-21_flE_htIV76U.html">Medford City Council - Nov. 29, 2011</a></h2>
