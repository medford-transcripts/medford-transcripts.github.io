 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7640.454s">Good</a> evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7640.894s">Mario</a> Martin at 198 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7643.516s">I</a> just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7647.618s">sort</a> of echo a little bit of some of the comments that were mentioned earlier in terms of economic growth and development here. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7654.103s">I</a> think Mark Crowley really nailed it in terms of how we look at opportunities to see growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7662.49s">But</a> if we actually take a second to apply that same principle to the current situation, which is this massage parlor and the pawn shop, <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7675.043s">Typically,</a> if you think about it, when a business starts up, they consider many factors in terms of how they're going to operate their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7684.807s">One</a> is an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7687.488s">Two,</a> they develop a marketing structure, a basic analysis of how they're going to push this product, whether a product or a service. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7697.992s">And</a> then lastly, they look for a demographic. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7703.294s">A</a> pawn shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7704.952s">and</a> a massage parlor, these specific types of businesses only look for certain types of demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7714.235s">And</a> it'd be really, really sad to have that conversation about whether this is that type of demographic that they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7721.478s">So,</a> you know, that's something to really, really consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/F9Dj7AZRD7I&t=7724.499s">Thank</a> you.
