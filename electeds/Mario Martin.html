 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6296.043s">Hi,</a> my name is Mario Martin at 198 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6301.245s">So</a> I am really astounded to obviously see that today we're talking about charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6310.149s">Once</a> again, I mean, we've talked about it quite a few times. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6313.371s">But</a> it really feels like today it's going in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6318.213s">30</a> years ago, before I was born, by the way, I just turned 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6321.014s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6324.48s">So</a> before I was born, this was brought up, this was changed, and it was obviously in an effort to change the way the city was going. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6333.148s">What</a> it's done is, it's put an extreme amount of stress on one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6342.317s">Who</a> would want so much stress in one position? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6346.38s">The</a> mayor has the city <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6350.668s">at</a> that time on his, and now at this time, on her shoulders. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6354.95s">And</a> it's, I won't say it's a burden, but it's a really, really tough and weighted weight to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6363.974s">But</a> today we're talking about it, and it's so much more important because over the past few years, people have been talking about it, gathering signatures, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6379.772s">and</a> haven't gotten anywhere with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6382.954s">Now</a> we have a group of citizens who have said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6388.116s">I</a> think it's time that we really, really, really seriously take back the true definition of democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6398.001s">I</a> think we need more democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6400.843s">And</a> this resolution that is being brought forward today by Mr. Marks, Councilor Marks, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6409.79s">is</a> so much more closer to really, truly living the Medford dream, not so much the American dream, but the Medford dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6421.593s">It's</a> crucial that we understand that it's not really going to be 6,000 signatures that a bunch of citizens are going to have to go out there and go start collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6432.776s">It's</a> more, may need 7,000 signatures because some of those residents aren't registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6440.019s">So</a> this resolution, thus bypassing the petition of signatures, is really going to help instill that true definition of democracy that we really need here. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6456.827s">And</a> this city council should be applauded for bringing this into the consideration finally, after so much time of disagreements between administrations, simply because <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6468.923s">Without</a> this, we're simply not going to be able to have the city council, the administration in general isn't going to have the tools to be able to govern. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6477.151s">I</a> mean, what does the city council really have? <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6479.313s">All</a> they really vote on is the budget every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6481.295s">That's</a> it. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6481.936s">You've</a> got nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6483.637s">So</a> let's balance the power out a little bit.
 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6516.995s">The</a> role of the council is simply to pass the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6520.856s">Because</a> anything else, unfortunately, that is either presented or talked about or is simply put forward to the city council has to be signed by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6535.46s">So</a> with a balance of power.
 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6553.566s">Thank</a> you. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6554.266s">Um,</a> regardless of which, uh, I truly, I truly want to, you know, congratulate and praise Mr. Mark, uh, excuse me, council Marks for, uh, for just listening to the, listening to the citizens, taking everything that everyone's campaigned on here and bring and bringing it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6570.852s">Uh,</a> another thing, Mr. Um, councilor Scarpelli and, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6575.344s">Councilor</a> Caraviello was mentioned about the call-in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6580.008s">I</a> just wanted to say that personally, I disagree with it respectfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6589.116s">And</a> the reason why I respectfully disagree with it, if it matters, is that, simply put, if we have an elected charter commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6599.307s">these</a> members of this charter commission are most likely going to be residents who kind of know what's going on in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6608.229s">So</a> these people would have gone through historical changes, know the history, understand what's going on in the community long enough, whereas bringing outside people is a great help and a great suggestion, you know, to kind of like, you know, get the conversation going, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6625.722s">And</a> I think at some point they should be implemented, but no one's gonna know this city, no one's gonna know Medford, no one's gonna help Medford better than the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6636.666s">So</a> respectfully, it's not to undermine anyone or anything, it's just simply saying that I think that the citizens really should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6645.67s">But</a> overall, I wanted to say thank you, Mr. Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6649.444s">And</a> a very special thank you to the city solicitor for both the councilor, Michael Marks, and him working together towards getting this resolution going. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=6663.029s">Thank</a> you very much.
 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9024.399s">Mario</a> Martin, 198 Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9027.32s">I</a> want to say I'm really surprised at just what happened here over the last few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9031.122s">It's</a> shocking. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9034.804s">Quite</a> frankly, I mean, tonight's the night to make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9041.486s">So</a> whether we take this to a committee of the whole, which a lot of residents won't agree with, because again, as Councilor Mark said, it's going to be buried. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9052.671s">And</a> we're just going to waste some more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9054.639s">but</a> the citizens have been talking about this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9057.881s">It's</a> not about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9058.941s">We</a> mentioned this, uh, last year, same time during the previous session and it didn't go and it didn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9067.785s">The</a> only thing we want is democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9069.226s">We</a> just want a democratic, uh, way of governing our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9074.308s">And,</a> and, and, and we want to give the city council and this administration the tools to govern, but you know, just, <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9085.324s">With</a> all this being said, ignorance is not the subject that this should be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9093.746s">And</a> tonight isn't about making a decision on whether charter review should be evaluated tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9103.188s">It's</a> about bypassing the signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9105.409s">It's</a> not about being an expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9108.83s">You're</a> elected, you should be an expert.
 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9126.205s">Whether</a> we make a decision at a committee of the whole next week or tonight, the signatures are going to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9132.252s">The</a> signatures will be taken and we'll do it on our own.
 <p>[Mario Martin]: <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9138.331s">That's</a> all I got to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/acqgxK4yhEM&t=9139.751s">Whether</a> it's decided upon tonight, tomorrow, next week, next month.
