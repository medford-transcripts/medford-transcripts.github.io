 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1891.218s">My</a> name is Page Buldini. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1892.739s">I'm</a> the owner of Paige Aesthetic Skincare in the Hillside, a Medford public school parent, and I serve on the board of the Medford Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1899.244s">My</a> husband, Jeff, grew up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1900.765s">Our</a> daughter, Kate, is a second grader at Missittuck, growing up in the same schools and community her dad once did. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1906.69s">Nearly</a> seven years ago, I started my business as a new mom and kept it open through the pandemic, when many in my industry closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1913.475s">I</a> had to adapt, problem solve, and keep revenue coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1916.698s">That's</a> not easy as a solo business owner, but I did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1920.02s">I</a> also helped others in the skincare industry push through because I believe in lifting people up. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1924.843s">That's</a> who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1925.564s">I</a> don't quit, I adapt, I listen, and I follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1929.126s">And</a> that's what I'll bring to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1931.347s">Those</a> lessons also reflect the spirit of Medford, a city with deep roots and tradition, a city that's growing and changing, and above all, a city whose strength is in its people, our schools, our small businesses, and the city services that keep us running. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1943.094s">I've</a> seen what happens when we bring those pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1946.355s">As</a> a chamber board member, I work to support small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1949.537s">I've</a> coached and sponsored local youth sports, and I know the value of showing up for kids and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1954.559s">Partnering</a> with the PTOs and schools, I've helped expand resources for students, families, and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1960.101s">And</a> by connecting groups like the Chamber run Medford and Tufts University, I've helped raise funds to bring Tufts student-athletes in as volunteers for school and community events. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1969.189s">Proof</a> of what's possible in a reminder that Tufts can be a stronger financial partner and better neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1975.374s">That's</a> why I believe leadership has to rise above groups or sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1979.239s">I</a> chose to run unaffiliated. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1981.462s">It</a> would be easier to do this with a group or a slate, but that's not why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1986.148s">I'm</a> willing to take the harder path to represent everyone, to bridge divides, and to make decisions rooted in what's best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1993.217s">This</a> is a critical moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1994.598s">Decisions</a> on zoning and growth will shape our future for decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=1998.222s">When</a> zoning reform came forward, I asked to slow it down, not to stop it, so we could get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2003.486s">I</a> championed separating business districts with mixed use from residential, and I used that time to ask questions and push for input from fire, police, and educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2012.134s">That's</a> how I will approach every issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2014.356s">Do</a> the work, listen first, and make decisions with real-life data and community voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2019.14s">That</a> same approach must guide our budget and growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2022.463s">We</a> need to generate more revenue to make Medford stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2025.346s">That</a> means creating a developer program with clear expectations that ensures developers support our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2030.67s">It</a> means attracting the right businesses shaped by community feedback to fill vacant storefronts and bring in revenue that Medford needs to invest in our future. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2038.917s">What</a> sets me apart is I've lived this. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2041.46s">I've</a> run a business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2042.701s">I've</a> navigated challenges and I stayed the course when it would have been easier to quit. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2046.444s">That</a> experience makes me the candidate best prepared to strengthen Medford's future. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2051.267s">At</a> the end of the day, what I bring is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2053.168s">I've</a> proven I can get through hard challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2055.169s">I'm</a> connected across Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2057.571s">I</a> adapt, I listen, and I solve problems, and I'm not afraid to show up for the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2061.933s">After</a> more than 15 years of living here, I believe Medford's best days are ahead, and I will keep showing up, asking questions, and moving forward together. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2068.337s">Thank</a> you to the Medford Democratic Committee, to my fellow candidates, and to everyone here showing up for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/og30Vvr2J5c&t=2072.699s">Thank</a> you.<h2><a href="../2025-08-28_afnvZAYk2_M/2025-08-28_afnvZAYk2_M.html">2025 Candidates Forum - Medford Public

 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=79.284s">Yes,</a> so I'm Page Buldini. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=80.986s">I'm</a> originally from Holliston, a suburb outside of Framingham, and I've been in Medford for over 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=87.755s">My</a> husband's from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=89.217s">Oh,</a> nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=89.697s">Yep,</a> where we live on Winter Street is where he grew up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=93.542s">Own</a> a skincare salon on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=95.424s">So</a> I've been there for almost seven years And I am a mom to a rising second grader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=101.23s">She</a> is going to be She's so excited for school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=104.853s">She</a> is at mistook formerly the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=107.256s">Okay,</a> and I'm also a board member of the Chamber of Commerce Wow Impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=112.861s">Thank</a> you.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=133.793s">It's</a> so funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=134.894s">Had</a> you asked me this a few years ago, I probably wouldn't have said yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=139.177s">But</a> I think when I opened my skincare salon there, I've realized there's never really a good time to take a big jump into something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=147.704s">And</a> I've been very lucky to have been involved with a lot of really great initiatives and collaborations through the chamber and as a small business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=157.352s">So</a> I've already been in the room for some of these great decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=160.375s">And</a> I just decided, well, I really want to help <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=163.357s">get</a> that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=164.597s">And</a> I think my experience as a small business owner and now as a public school parent, it allows me to already have been doing some of those great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=172.659s">So</a> it was just the perfect time to give it a try.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=207.508s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=208.148s">Well,</a> one, a few of them, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=211.489s">I'm</a> very passionate and excited to hear that the charter has made it and will be on our ballot in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=217.291s">So</a> that's very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=218.732s">And</a> I think specifically as a member of the board for the chamber and a business owner, ward representation, specifically in our business districts, is essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=228.762s">And</a> I feel like the more opportunity that we can get people together and that we can get the opportunity for there to be a representative if people have a problem, they can go and talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=240.192s">And</a> then that's a liaison, another step into City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=242.554s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=243.415s">And</a> I feel like to kind of parlay that too, it would be really wonderful if we could create roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=248.84s">So</a> essentially within our wards, we have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=252.983s">And</a> I found this with everything with zoning, which I'm sure we'll chat about more too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=257.347s">We'll</a> get into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=258.067s">There</a> was a lot of information out there, but there was no way to fully gather it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=263.169s">And</a> when I have my clients in the room, I get to actively listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=266.951s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=267.711s">And</a> they come from all different neighborhoods, even outside of Medford, and everybody was confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=273.173s">So</a> I think if we could have a good ward representative in your community, then every month or so, they can meet with our city service providers, City Hall, and the neighbors to chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=282.716s">I</a> also think zoning, that's a big one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=285.117s">We'll</a> keep talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=286.158s">Oh,</a> yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=286.978s">I</a> think as a city, we do need zoning reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=289.699s">I</a> definitely that is not a question for many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=294.18s">And</a> as you know, I've been speaking about it and how to include a lot of studies and a lot of individuals that have real life experience like Medford fire police, DW and our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=306.283s">and</a> get their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=307.564s">So</a> I feel like doing a slow phased approach focusing on Medford Square and Mystic Ave and then if we can support as a city, then we can look into our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=318.894s">So</a> I've been actively speaking out since May. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=320.876s">And</a> I also think a really great program we have that we need to utilize more is our vacant storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=327.461s">As</a> a small business owner, I think it's really wonderful to find ways to make these squares vibrant, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=334.323s">If</a> we want to continue to build Medford, we need to support the small businesses that are there, but we need to incentivize the business owners and landlords to actually want to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=343.604s">But</a> yeah, and then pretty much my biggest thing is I want to create a space where Medford Fire, Police, DPW, and our teachers have a liaison to City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=352.166s">I</a> feel like that is something that we're lacking, and I feel like I could be a <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=356.267s">a</a> great communicator as I have been within the chamber and my business.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=384.729s">I</a> am on my own, but I feel very lucky that I have a lot of support from my family, my friends, my clients, small business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=392.631s">And</a> because I've been actively listening to the questions and the concerns from different sides of Medford, I feel like I couldn't do a good job representing the whole city if I decided to just join a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=405.593s">And</a> I want to keep that open-minded space that I might not agree, or an individual might not agree with me, but I will always be available to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=415.608s">And</a> I have learned from getting feedback, which in the moment might not feel great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=420.915s">I</a> can learn something, no matter what. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=423.417s">I'm</a> always learning lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=425.678s">So</a> I feel like having a difference in perspectives is huge for problem solving. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=430.841s">Because</a> if we're all thinking alike, there's no way that we can get creative, and there's always something that you can learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=437.565s">So</a> running independently is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=440.245s">Yes,</a> it's a little trickier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=441.886s">Um,</a> but there, as I've learned, there's a lot of people in Medford that feel the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=445.906s">They're</a> like, kind of like some things on one side or some things in the other, but they really care about Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=452.088s">And</a> I'm looking for that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=453.488s">I</a> feel like I can do a good job representing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=455.428s">And</a> again, I'm here to listen to.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=492.036s">I'm</a> gonna try.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=519.855s">Well,</a> I have to say, as a member of the chamber, I was privy to learning about it, but I feel like I had no idea what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=530.426s">And</a> once I saw, mostly on social media, from other residents, specifically in the Glenwood neighborhood, <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=537.813s">And</a> on Salem Street, I was like, oh, wow, this is a really big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=542.274s">And</a> then just as a, again, business owner in a business district, I just kept thinking about, OK, well, if this is an impact, no matter what, I want to really learn about how we decided to come about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=555.737s">So</a> I just started asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=557.017s">And</a> I feel really lucky that there are so many residents <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=561.878s">in</a> the community who have done so much research and they're open to answering my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=568.36s">Because</a> I was writing emails and I was speaking at the community development meetings and some of the city council meetings and those are kind of the forums to really get those in those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=579.323s">Residents</a> did that and that's really incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=582.324s">What</a> I did learn is a lot of the questions that I did ask and they were quite specific about how we thought about zoning, the studies or the impacts <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=591.586s">studies</a> that were done to inform our decisions, and the real life examples weren't really happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=599.11s">So</a> I was happy to see that there's been conversations around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=602.913s">Since</a> May 30th was the first email I sent out to the city councilors, planning and development, community development board, and the mayor, I've been actively asking, what does Medford Fire, police, DPW, and our teachers think? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=618.262s">and</a> their union members, because they are, like myself, I have that real-life experience when I'm in a room with my clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=626.528s">It's</a> so important to have data and it's so important to have similar neighborhoods or to see cities that have done zoning like this, but sometimes you need that real-life, like, could a fire truck fit down this street? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=639.077s">You</a> know, there's questions about parking, like what does our traffic enforcement think, you know, and I feel like the more times you can bring those individuals that have real life experience into the conversation, it's game changing, and it's collaborative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=653.318s">So</a> those are my main points. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=655.42s">The</a> reason why I did say publicly, slow down first, and then I said separate, was because I couldn't get those answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=663.586s">And</a> then I was super honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=666.028s">And</a> it wasn't in a means to create problems or trouble, but the fire chief did respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=672.753s">And</a> I was so honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=674.474s">That</a> he responds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=675.295s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=676.335s">And</a> I thought that was brave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=677.716s">And</a> I thought that was incredible to hear, again, that real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=683.04s">experienced.</a> 
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=684.101s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=684.682s">So</a> that has created a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=687.804s">I'm</a> really still kind of unsure about where the process stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=691.968s">I</a> was able to put in the last moment for public comment was the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=696.732s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=697.012s">And</a> I did post I will share this in this will be on my website and social media. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=701.115s">I</a> did share a question specifically in my area which my so we live in the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=706.24s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=706.78s">My</a> business is in the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=709.182s">But</a> the way that it's zoned is where we are, there's going to be the proposed tough zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=714.867s">Where</a> my business is, it's the Boston Ave corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=717.97s">And</a> the zoning around that, and this is very similar to a lot of our other business districts, is called UR1, which goes up high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=727.238s">And</a> that would be wonderful and great in some areas, but where we are, it's a lot of single family or multifamilies, but there's those residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=736.727s">And</a> it was my question was, well, if we're doing the tough zone, which is the goal is to bring back more students for Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=743.654s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=744.034s">Why</a> are we then outside of the tough zone making the availability?
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=748.058s">So</a> those are the questions that I feel like are really important to ask and if if there is true studies if there is community Response, which we've heard right foreign to and for for and against that would be great But we need to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=761.386s">We</a> need to see it and we need the consultants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=763.227s">It's</a> also here, right?
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=789.847s">Funny</a> thing, just a quick add, and then we can talk, because I know we have some other great questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=795.229s">So</a> we live down the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=797.07s">So</a> our neighborhood would be zoned, I think it's NR3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=799.891s">So</a> it wouldn't really change much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=802.072s">And</a> my neighborhood is already being developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=804.353s">So</a> we're already living through that impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=806.214s">So</a> I have that real life experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=808.715s">And</a> a bunch of my neighbors and myself have spoken about developers that are doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=812.137s">So</a> I do understand that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=813.858s">Where</a> I am on Boston Ave, it's nine units right in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=817.579s">It</a> would be ideal for mixed use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=819.88s">And</a> I've put my business, which is the way that I pay my bills and support my family, out there because I'm not opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=826.723s">And</a> I do believe that there should be affordable housing above me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=829.905s">It</a> makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=830.505s">It's</a> right near the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=831.645s">It's</a> right on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=832.746s">I</a> just want to know how will we then support the businesses if there's business disruption, if there is changes to parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=839.109s">And</a> I think those are the questions that we need to really just know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=843.09s">And</a> it could just be this is how it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=844.991s">But</a> at least if we can put it out there, we can advocate for those.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=883.92s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=884.341s">So</a> I have, I think, three pretty solid ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=888.003s">One</a> would be zoning specifically, making sure that we can bring commercial development in if it's Mystic Ave corridor, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=896.188s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=896.649s">Let's</a> do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=897.529s">Let's</a> work with individuals that will help bring in some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=901.913s">I</a> think also a really great thing is Medford, as you know, because you're from Medford, there is so much history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=907.619s">And</a> I feel like we need to tap into tourism. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=910.101s">And</a> I feel like if we can build a city that people want to come and visit, <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=914.885s">they</a> will spend money, they will stay, they will then visit those businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=919.406s">That's</a> revenue right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=920.547s">And</a> we really need to tap in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=921.827s">And</a> especially what I got to see with the 250th celebration of the revolution and what Lexington did, that was incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=931.21s">And</a> to see celebrities coming in, I feel like that's an untapped market. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=935.531s">We</a> have the Chevalier, the amount of really wonderful and inspiring people who come in, <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=940.692s">It's</a> great and it's an extension of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=943.576s">So</a> I think that is super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=945.018s">So</a> really diving into tourism. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=947.14s">Another</a> thing that I learned when I was learning about zoning and affordable housing, what other cities do is they will bus in the city of whatever, say city of Medford, would bus in developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=959.194s">And</a> they would plan a day with maps and show them the available lots and say, this is what we want here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=966.259s">This</a> is what we see that could be built here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=968.761s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=969.341s">This</a> is what our streets, sewers, schools would need to accommodate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=973.624s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=974.124s">So</a> we then incentivize these people and we let them know what's because if you don't know, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=979.088s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=979.768s">And</a> I'm not a developer, but I would assume as a business owner, the easiest way to funnel something in is to show people that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=987.035s">So</a> I feel like creating a really strong, it would almost be like a developer engagement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=994.961s">And</a> then using our contacts, the Chamber of Commerce, who I love and super support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=999.425s">Chamber</a> does a good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1000.566s">We</a> sure do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1001.187s">And</a> I feel like that needs to be, that relationship needs to be much stronger. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1005.41s">I</a> myself, I'm a small business owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1007.411s">I</a> love to volunteer on the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1009.372s">I</a> love to help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1010.412s">I</a> have friends that start businesses and they call me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1013.133s">That</a> is such a great asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1015.354s">And</a> a lot of us have learned, like, I've had pipes burst. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1018.255s">I've</a> had fires. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1019.636s">And</a> those are the things, if you don't know, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1021.457s">But</a> continuing to support that and other organizations that are in the city, I think, will help make City Hall run smoother as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1029.2s">And</a> then we can bring in some dough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1030.701s">Sounds</a> good.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1080.144s">So</a> I feel like, yes, if we can be very mindful how we zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1085.048s">Yes,</a> we don't want to push anybody out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1087.249s">That</a> is never the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1088.629s">We</a> want to bring in, but we never want to push out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1092.07s">And</a> I, myself, and many other small businesses, we don't just have our small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1097.671s">We</a> cater to our clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1099.511s">I</a> have 70% of my clients come from outside Medford, and then they go to Goldilocks, they go to Tasty, they go to the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1107.973s">or</a> they moved to Medford because they've now come from JP or Rhode Island or New Hampshire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1113.196s">So</a> that is, small businesses are key. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1115.457s">Also,</a> I think another really wonderful thing about many small business owners is a lot of us have children in the school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1121.04s">So</a> we are fully invested to building that up so that we can create those community connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1127.163s">There's</a> this really great group right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1128.804s">It's</a> the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1130.324s">It's</a> called the Citywide PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1132.085s">So</a> all of the elementary schools have parent volunteers, and we've been doing collaborative events. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1137.688s">to</a> connect the four schools, but then to also raise money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1140.869s">And</a> I love that I can use my small business friends and chamber friends, business owners, the banks, you know, all of these institutions, and then we can help fund them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1149.891s">They</a> all help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1150.491s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1150.971s">And</a> it's just it's everybody wants to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1153.112s">So</a> small business has to be at the heart of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1155.793s">And</a> it has to be something in the forefront when we plan.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1173.078s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1173.718s">Yeah,</a> they go to the Ford like right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1175.518s">It's</a> great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1176.038s">And</a> I feel like the more that we can do that, the better that it will be.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1188.301s">Yeah.</a> 
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1189.782s">Good</a> supporter of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1191.602s">He</a> is.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1192.522s">All</a> Medford restaurants, schools, people.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1226.194s">So</a> that was a hard one for me because I never try to go negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1229.556s">But</a> what I could say is what I would like to strengthen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1232.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1233.918s">Especially</a> because I'm on the hillside and this is always a, you know, a neighborhood thing is our relationship as a city with Tufts University.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1242.762s">I</a> feel like that is an untapped market. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1247.329s">The</a> one thing I can say is because of where I am on the hillside with the chamber, but also just I went to a manual college and I have a great connection with now Tufts Athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1257.683s">Any</a> time for some of these PTO events that I've needed help and I've called Tufts, whether it's community relations or the Tufts student athletes, some were my clients, they always volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1270.541s">So</a> one of those PTO events that I was just a very small part of, <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1274.086s">organizing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1274.746s">It</a> was at the Great American Beer Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1276.247s">The</a> Citywide PTO did an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1279.108s">It</a> was insane. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1280.789s">And</a> I just asked my friends at Tufts, the student liaisons for the athletes, and we got like 30 student athletes that came and participated and volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1289.632s">So</a> when you ask, they will help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1292.093s">But</a> things that I learned when I've been researching and sitting in some of the community meetings is <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1297.555s">they're</a> a big part of the footprint up on the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1301.278s">And</a> as we know, it's a university, so we understand about taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1305.221s">But</a> what I didn't know about was the pilot programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1308.023s">Do</a> you know about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1309.064s">I,</a> I, a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1311.086s">Yes.</a> 
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1314.068s">No,</a> so it's been interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1315.829s">So</a> essentially, it's if you are like a nonprofit or university, you're not paying taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1321.231s">But</a> Medford has in the past received payments from Tufts, and it's to support infrastructure, it's support the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1330.535s">But</a> I think if we were negotiating there, I would have to fact check this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1334.217s">But</a> I don't think there is a permanent <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1336.938s">pilot</a> program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1337.678s">So</a> I think that would be a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1339.359s">Let's</a> say Tufts, you're here, you're part of, you know, you help our small businesses, but you also help, you know, with housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1347.422s">So</a> why don't we see what we can do there? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1349.382s">So</a> that would be a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1351.143s">I</a> also think we're in the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1352.523s">This</a> is such a great space, internship opportunities, like Tufts, that is a great opportunity for all of the Vogue, but any student really. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1361.186s">And</a> like I said, if we can ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1363.007s">I</a> think it's just we need to make sure we create that strong, that Tufts is in Medford, but we are not Tufts, we are Medford, and they're a neighbor, but they also need to be a willing participant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1373.071s">And</a> I have seen them come to the table, but I feel like that would be a really great opportunity to strengthen, and that would help also infuse some of our money.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1438.631s">The</a> worst thing happens is a no, but at least it's a try. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1441.414s">So</a> those are the things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1442.436s">And</a> then hopefully we can bring in some more connections. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1445.3s">All</a> right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1445.7s">So</a> you gave me an almost least favorite thing, but I love that.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1450.507s">So</a> most favorite. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1452.47s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1452.991s">What's</a> your most favorite? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1454.152s">So</a> there's so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1455.233s">I</a> mean, I could do all of the great small businesses and how we could really become a Mecca of the food world with everything going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1461.856s">But</a> I think the easiest and most important thing about Medford is the convenience factor of you can get in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1469.1s">We</a> have now the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1471.041s">We</a> have the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1472.722s">I'm</a> right near Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1473.762s">I'm</a> 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1474.643s">But</a> as somebody who's from Holliston, which is pretty rural, there's farms, there's field, there are places in Medford that you go and you forget that you're so close to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1483.587s">Um,</a> and we live right near Memorial. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1485.57s">So</a> we have the mystic river, the boat club up at the mystic lakes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1489.334s">The</a> pond, the sheep's fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1491.697s">So</a> you can go and all of a sudden there's deer because you're in Oak Grove, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1495.622s">I</a> heard a deer or there's a great blue heron that flew by. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1498.505s">So</a> even though we are so conveniently close to the city, north, south, east, west, you have those like glimmers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1505.352s">And</a> then when I join the chamber, I help out with communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1509.236s">Not</a> being from Medford, I just went to the library and did it, which I'll plug the library all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1514.241s">Me</a> too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1515.282s">I</a> love the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/2OQcjzjN9wY&t=1515.863s">It's</a> a good library.

 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=446.8s">That's</a> a great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=448.061s">So</a> I think a really wonderful thing that I have. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=451.947s">via</a> my husband being from here and me not originally being from here is, I think Medford has such deep roots and such great history, but I think we're also on this cusp of like welcoming so many new people in and so many good new businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=468.359s">So</a> I feel like as a business owner, I really love making that easier. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=474.063s">So</a> I think the easiest way to do that would just make Medford open for business, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=478.166s">Like</a> make City Hall, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=480.307s">a</a> place where we can expedite, you know, like business, like it's hard to open a small business I guess I could say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=487.73s">So</a> just making sure that the building department is prepared for that permitting is prepared for that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=493.132s">And</a> then also creating that good connection with the chamber so we can nourish that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=497.145s">I</a> think having strong communication is great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=499.867s">I</a> love the way that I get to talk to my clients, whether it's through social media, through newsletters, so continuing to strengthen that, making our website easily accessible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=510.074s">I</a> talk about it all the time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=511.335s">I</a> promote the caches calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=515.032s">to</a> like 80% of my clients if they need to figure out something to do, cause it's so great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=520.857s">And</a> I love that it's on the Medford city's calendar. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=524.78s">You</a> can find it there too, but just making sure that residents can find the information they need very easily. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=530.044s">And</a> then I think specifically with when I decided to run for city council, I kind of just literally Googled or chat to BT, what does the city councilor do? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=542.316s">And</a> the three main reoccurring things are that the most not most important, but their main jobs are zoning ordinances and then like the general way that the community in the city government works. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=554.486s">So</a> I feel very lucky that I'm stepping into the midst of a big zoning conversation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=560.432s">And</a> I'm learning so much and I love to learn so that's great and I feel like having the opportunity to have my clients and my neighbors ask me questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=570.976s">I</a> am a person that really believes in getting as much information as possible. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=575.986s">And</a> it doesn't mean if it's aligned with myself or not, because I will always find something that I can learn. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=581.212s">So</a> I think that the zoning reform right now is something that is really important for everybody to just really fully understand and also have an opportunity to have a say. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=591.637s">Another</a> cool thing that I learned about, because again, I'm learning from everywhere, is it isn't necessarily a typical way to have as many public meetings or have as many public opportunities for the community when it comes to zoning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=605.64s">So</a> we actually have a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=607.921s">I</a> do have to say, though, it's really confusing to me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=611.101s">I</a> don't know if you're following along, and you might be, and this is not to even ask that of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=616.002s">So</a> to find a way, I've been advocating for like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=618.843s">you</a> know, pictures of what this real life pictures of or simple zoning, not critiques, but like abbreviations and just really being able to ask those questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=630.411s">And</a> I just engaged with Medford fire, Medford police and Medford schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=635.495s">And</a> that's including like chiefs down to the union reps and just ask what, how they feel about it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=641.259s">Cause</a> I feel like including every person that I possibly can to get a good informed <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=648.105s">just</a> information is the best that I can do and then by sharing that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=652.287s">So</a> those are kind of my big three. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=655.749s">It's</a> pretty much honoring who we are, engaging who we're becoming, smart and transparent growth, small business support, obviously, and then communication are like my four big pillars that I'm actively trying to learn more about and get feedback from.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=745.103s">Yeah,</a> that's a great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=748.904s">And</a> I feel like no matter what, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=753.236s">there's</a> gonna be opinions that differ. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=756.138s">And</a> I think that's really important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=758.74s">I</a> feel like that's the only way that we can get as much opinion and also like enough people that feel like they're a part of it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=767.788s">So</a> I've heard all, I feel like I have really great friends that are excellent affordable housing advocates. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=777.135s">and</a> architects and that's their world. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=779.237s">I</a> also have residents that don't feel that this is something for them, or feel that their neighborhood character will change. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=789.687s">As</a> a business owner, so funny, I've newly been speaking at some of these meetings and I have heard public comment, negative and positive, which is fine because I'm putting myself out there and that's what happens, right? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=802.498s">And</a> I feel like even if it feels negative coming at me, it's feedback and it's something, even if the delivery doesn't feel kind, there's something I can learn from there and that's been helpful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=815.428s">And</a> when I'm listening and speaking, I use my business where I'm currently right now, 319 Boston Ave, right on the Boston Ave corridor, which is a business district, as the perfect example of an area that should be rezoned for mixed use. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=833.244s">And</a> I'm literally putting my business <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=836.757s">out</a> there, also my neighbors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=838.938s">It's</a> one level of nine units. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=841.359s">There</a> should be housing and it should be affordable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=844.181s">We're</a> right near the green line, like we're right in 93 and 16. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=847.862s">However,</a> as a business owner selfishly, I just was asking questions of, okay, so what were to happen if this building was incentivized to be redeveloped? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=859.828s">you</a> know, how would we support the small businesses? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=862.449s">And</a> I have gotten some information. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=865.07s">But</a> also another really cool plug that you didn't ask for, but it's so helpful, is the Medver public library, you can rent a librarian. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=873.373s">I</a> don't know if you knew this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=875.113s">No.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=876.014s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=876.874s">Now</a> I've done it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=877.374s">I've</a> done it once with Sam, who's awesome for some campaign assistance, and she was great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=881.896s">And</a> now I'm going to do it again with Jenna Barry, who is in the Resource Center. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=885.905s">and</a> you can ask them a question and they will find every resource possible and it could be to like build a like a model airplane or learn how to run a campaign independently or it could be how do we create a business plan and they're saying we're not experts but we will find every resource we can so <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=908.1s">Trying</a> to find that so essentially like my hope with this is, again, I don't think everybody will be happy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=914.946s">I</a> personally do feel like I need more information as I keep asking some people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=920.67s">I</a> do think it would be wonderful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=922.792s">I</a> know some zoning of the districts has already gone through like I know. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=928.376s">over</a> the Glenwood, like Salem Street has already gone through that district. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=932.298s">I</a> know Misty Gap Corridor has already gone through. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=934.799s">So</a> those are things that I don't know what they can do to kind of quote unquote go back. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=938.581s">But</a> I do feel like if there was a way to separate them a little bit and have strong business district zoning, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=946.985s">figure</a> it out, make sure we really do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=948.767s">I</a> don't want to lose affordable housing here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=950.809s">I</a> feel like that's so important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=952.49s">And</a> then really evaluate the residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=954.652s">I</a> feel like that could be a potential compromise. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=956.854s">But</a> again, I know that there's some people that feel like, I want it, let's do it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=960.538s">And</a> some people are like, I don't. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=962.64s">So</a> it's kind of this funny place where I'm towing the line. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=966.023s">But</a> I do I have publicly asked to slow it down a bit. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=970.107s">So</a> that's, that's fair to share.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1046.614s">Yeah,</a> so it's, it's so wonderful and timely I had, I can't quote unquote I don't know if I received it or not and I'm thinking positive, but I had a second interview with the Massachusetts women's political caucus. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1058.423s">And</a> we spoke specifically about my views on certain things, but one thing that was really wonderful that I could share is as a skincare provider as I shared before I have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1069.24s">all</a> walks of life, every person, whoever they are, can come in here and feel themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1075.304s">And</a> I feel like coming at this campaign in the way that we could run the city to find a way, we don't all have to agree, but to find specific ways that we can make people feel valued and seen, I feel like that's great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1087.413s">And</a> I feel like our arts community does a really great job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1090.375s">And</a> as I shouted out with Cashay before, I feel like really engaging in ways that people can feel creative, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1097.673s">can</a> feel themselves. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1098.874s">It</a> also supports like within our businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1101.136s">I</a> feel like that's a great way to amplify maybe you know bringing in different types of businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1106.28s">They</a> don't necessarily all have to look the same and I feel like that would be a great opportunity to diversify but also be way more inclusive and I love that we have that opportunity with specifically even with some zoning changes and stuff that's going to allow some growth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1122.232s">I</a> feel like within our schools it's been really cool. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1125.434s">I'm</a> sure because obviously you know as well, just seeing my daughter within a member public school and the nexus program, and how it shows you know how to be a good friend and how to be a good advocate, and I just think. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1137.721s">she's</a> in first will finish first grade. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1140.062s">And</a> these are skills that she's learning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1142.444s">And</a> again, it could it doesn't have to be a big broad thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1147.047s">But</a> it's coming back and making people feel valued and seen and heard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1150.689s">And</a> I feel like the more that we can kind of show that within the way that we're transparent with our communication, or we're open to show businesses are welcome here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1160.335s">I</a> feel like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1161.468s">or</a> we can continue to incorporate our arts, our music, our sports. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1165.772s">I</a> feel like those are just great ways that we can start. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1167.973s">I</a> don't necessarily know what Mefford is doing, not even that you asked wrong, but I feel like there's a great opportunity for any of the quote unquote old and new or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1181.392s">different</a> mindsets to actually start. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1183.735s">Hopefully</a> either they don't have to look at each other, but we have some, we have a, Medford is on the cusp of something really wonderful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1192.106s">And</a> I feel like if we can continue to honor that, you know, the historic Med we have, but also be welcoming, I think that's a great opportunity.
 <p>[Page Buldini]: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1231.346s">Yeah,</a> and I do, I have been told that people don't necessarily want to come together and that is fair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1238.591s">And</a> I feel like that is not any of our jobs that ever change somebody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1243.554s">I</a> feel like whoever you are, you should feel good about that and be true to your values. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1249.377s">But</a> I feel like, and I think like Run Medford is a really great example where <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1254.2s">multiple</a> groups can come together to literally raise money for my for public schools, you know, and I feel like there's more of those like Oktoberfest, you know, for the chamber, we had that whole street filled with all different types of businesses. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1269.507s">And,</a> you know, like Medford youth sports, and we had your awesome podcast, and it was just cool to see, again, they might not be politically aligned, they might not be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1279.911s">you</a> know, whatever type of their moral compass aligned, but we all had a blast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1286.514s">And</a> I feel like more of those opportunities, again, we don't have to get along, we don't have to be together, but I feel like that's kind of my hope. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1293.718s">And</a> that's what I'm good at. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1295.078s">I</a> have no idea how it started, but I think maybe it's the active listener role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0zJLIhYd1J4FjypS6aoJou?t=1299.38s">I</a> just pick up on these things and I'm like, oh, right, like that would make sense for that and refer it out and go.

<a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11197.548s">Director</a> Hunt had replied about incentivizing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11201.971s">But</a> I just want to, I have a whole list of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11206.094s">So</a> thank you for the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11207.615s">And</a> I think it might have been Adam, I was just listening into asking about that from the small business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11213.82s">It's</a> really important that we also support the businesses that have chosen to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11218.003s">And</a> yes, I lease, I don't own my building. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11223.066s">And</a> I'm up near Tufts, so I'm also very mindful of what that looks like when it comes to zoning and housing in the Dover Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11230.853s">And</a> I just really want to be an advocate for the community where I don't know if I could afford to rent a space if it was fully developed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11239.76s">I</a> don't know what that would look like during development. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11242.742s">And</a> granted, it might not happen right away with zoning, but the potential is to incentivize my landlord to probably do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11250.689s">So</a> what are we going to do as a city to support our small business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11254.252s">Because</a> I would hope that we don't want to lose us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11256.694s">We've</a> all worked really hard to help grow what these neighborhoods have become. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11261.157s">And</a> yes, there are a lot of us that are in buildings that are not <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11266.321s">probably</a> zoned appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11267.482s">So</a> I am hopeful that we can be supportive of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11271.103s">And</a> then when it also comes to that proactivity of what we can do for our small business community, you know, if my business is rezoned, what are we gonna do to support where I could potentially be or my colleagues in the future and how to also incentivize the landlords or the building owners to develop for people like myself in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/M2dn2QxmG2g&t=11290.833s">So</a> thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you for everybody working hard and everybody joining us tonight.<h2><a href="../2025-07-03_MCM00001768/2025-07-03_MCM00001768.html">Public Q& A On Corridor Proposals 05-29-25</a></h2>
