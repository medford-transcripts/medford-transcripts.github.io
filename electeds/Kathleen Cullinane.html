 <p>[Kathleen Cullinane]: <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4460.859s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4461.279s">Good</a> evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4463.221s">My</a> name is Katie Ma Cullinane. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4466.984s">On</a> the ballot, it's Kathleen Cullinane. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4469.246s">Most</a> people know me as Katie. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4470.567s">I</a> grew up in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4473.59s">And</a> I am one of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4476.412s">The</a> Ma's go back for a long way. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4479.515s">But</a> I went through the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4482.377s">I</a> went to the Dame School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4484.219s">From</a> the Dame, I went to Lincoln Junior High, where I met my husband, Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4489.755s">And</a> from there, I graduated Medford High School, class of 1989. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4495.158s">My</a> husband graduated 1989 also from the Medford Vocational School. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4500.72s">From</a> there, I went to nursing school, Library College in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4505.063s">And</a> I worked in the nursing field for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4508.764s">I</a> also got married to my husband. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4512.986s">We</a> have three children. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4514.827s">And</a> with that, I'm a mother of three, Mary, Kate, Megan, and Liam. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4519.03s">And</a> I've seen our community transform from small neighborhood schools into the 21st century. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4526.376s">And</a> we have better facilities, stronger core for the education. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4531.019s">We've</a> had technology updates and community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4535.743s">However,</a> despite all these changes, there's always room for greatness and improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4541.528s">Mary</a> Kate and Megan are attending college right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4545.11s">My</a> son, Liam, is a senior. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4548.724s">Throughout</a> Mary-Kate and Megan's career in the academics of our school system, they struggled. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4556.27s">But</a> with that, they were able to achieve what they needed to do to get to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4562.414s">They</a> were on IEPs, which is an early individualized education plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4568.799s">But</a> I was a strong advocate to make sure that they were able to move on and be successful and attend college right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4580.833s">As</a> far as special education, like I said, I am a strong advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4587.956s">And</a> there's a lot of programs that we could do to make our school system much better. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4595.699s">As</a> far as special education, there is most people, I'm not sure if you know this, 20% of the Americans who have a disability, which means that one fifth of our population <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4612.393s">you</a> know, needs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4613.813s">So</a> we need to advocate for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4616.754s">So</a> one-fifth of the budget should go towards special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4621.096s">Also,</a> we are coming into times where social emotional learning is a big thing within our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4630.938s">And</a> there are some programs out there as far as Open Circle, which is a research program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4637.011s">that</a> I know is done in other school systems, which would be great if we could have that in our approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4645.233s">Like</a> I said, we also have the opioid crisis right now, which maybe we can revamp our DARE program. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4658.275s">As</a> of before, we used to address the current issues, and our issues have changed, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4666.163s">possibly</a> do community partnership with our police officers and revamp everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4672.164s">For</a> example, the drunk driving issue was the big issue back when I was in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4677.945s">But</a> as of now, in a whole, we had 250 drunk driving death related deaths with the drinking and driving as compared to 2,500 10 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4690.567s">Our</a> new focus is marijuana. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4693.886s">the</a> opiates, and we need to change our program as far as being more aware and not being afraid to have different programs within our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4705.43s">Cultural</a> enhancements, we face changes every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4710.712s">The</a> demographics of Medford are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4713.313s">We</a> need to keep our city alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4716.354s">As</a> far as when I grew up, we always took field trips to the Royal House. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4720.336s">That</a> was big. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4721.95s">And</a> the Paul Revere run, which is in April, Patriot's Day, he would come down Main Street, stop at the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4729.814s">We</a> need to keep that alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4731.655s">We</a> need to enhance what we have within our city to make it better, not to just learn about everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4739.839s">We</a> need to keep Medford alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4741.319s">Medford's</a> a great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/c9BkgpEV0c8&t=4742.76s">Like</a> I said, I've grown up here my whole life, stayed here, was educated.
